i'm guessing -- and from the available evidence , it's not a great guess -- that burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire of hollywood excess , stupidity , ego and power-mongering . if so , the film that ended up on the screen ranks as one of the most spectacularly ironic unintentional jokes in film history . that left a film satire in the hands of writer joe eszterhas , as humorless a hack as ever put finger to word processor . and you could just smell the disaster brewing . if you're unfortunate enough to sit through burn hollywood burn , you'll still be smelling that disaster long after the lights come up . it's bad enough that burn hollywood burn has -- literally -- not a single laugh for its entire , blissfully brief 84 minutes . what makes it even worse is eszterhas' insistence upon telling every bad joke not once , but twice or even three times . michael ovitz references , showgirls references , oral sex references , whoopi goldberg/ted danson references -- all show up multiple times with all the subtlety that is eszterhas' stock-in-trade . the reduncancy even manages to turn actively offensive with some frequency , notably with the hilarious use of the word " feminist " as an identifying caption for every single female character in the film . those documentary captions , for all their leaden obviousness , allow the best insight into what's so hideously wrong with burn hollywood burn . not content to stick any hollywood type with only one jab from his rapier wit , eszterhas fills the screen with bullet points every time a new character appears . this is a petulant schoolboy's idea of satire -- pictures of hollywood insiders to which eszterhas has taken a pen to draw little moustaches and black out the teeth . the last stomach-churning straw comes when burn hollywood burn closes with out-takes over the closing credits , the kind that show the audience how much fun everyone was having making the film that just sucked an hour and a half of your life away . pity everyone involved with this excessive , ego-driven " satire " of excess and ego . it's too bad that only directors can remove their names from noxious material like this . otherwise , you might have seen credits for burn hollywood burn overflowing with alan smithees . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
there's bad buzz , and then there's the the bad buzz which surrounded the avengers , the kind that sounds like a swarm of africanized bees after a particularly vigorous hive-shaking . a gratuitous " f-word " had even been added to bump the rating from a pg to pg-13 . then , all the worst fears seemed to be confirmed when warner bros . announced that no advance screenings would be held for the media . you may think you're ready for the possibility that a film could be bad , but little can prepare you for something as pointless , smug and misguided as the avengers . it is the latter which proves most instantly and consistently grating in the avengers . ralph fiennes and uma thurman spend most of their scenes together engaging in a smirk throwing contest , each one trying to look the most amused with him or herself , eyebrows so prominently arched you're afraid someone might sprain something . this despite the fact that don macpherson's dialogue is a study in witlessness , tossing out embarrassing puns as though they were saucy enough to turn oscar wilde green with envy . though they generally appear content to let their wardrobe do most of the acting for them , fiennes and thurman should be commended for one impressive demonstration of dramatic skill : they're able to treat the most mundane comments as though they were nuggets of pure comic gold bestowed upon the world . that kind of quip-heavy self-awareness was certainly true of the namesake television series as well , so what's so wrong with this variation on the theme ? in short , both the personnel and the context . patrick macnee and diana rigg , the most celebrated of the series' pairings , shared a genuine chemistry which made the romantic tension fun to watch . fiennes and thurman appear far too enamored of their own charm and cleverness to bother connecting with one another . they're also dropped into a summer blockbuster milieu entirely inappropriate for light-hearted capering . imagine an episode of the old " batman " series with a $70 million budget , and you'll understand what's so wrong with the avengers . it's hard to endear yourself to an audience with low-tech campiness at the same time you're blowing something up every 10 minutes , or sending huge mechanical insects after our heroes like something out of the speeder bike chase from return of the jedi . we're long past the point of pretending that plot or character has anything to do with 1990s-model hollywood summer fare , so i won't even bother slapping the avengers around for exhibiting symptoms of that particular contagious disease . but such a film has to give you something to latch on to : engaging performers , effective pacing , a decent villain to hiss . not even sean connery , blustering about without the faintest idea why his character does anything , can pump up the charisma quotient of this tedious car wreck of a film . the closest recent analog to the avengers is batman and robin , but at least batman and robin had its sheer momenteum and comic-book gaudiness to salvage it . the avengers is just action sequences in search of a movie , actors in search of a reason to keep smirking . crimes against film audiences must be avenged ; the buzz of surly patrons coming out of the theater may be even more frightening than the buzz on the film . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
director : richard rush . director richard rush made his last film in 1980 , a sly thriller called the stunt man which was one of the year's critical favorites . and it looks like he may have to wait another fifteen years before anyone * lets * him direct again . soon , however , it appears that capa may also be the target of intended foul play . if it were not for my personal code of ethics , i would reveal every plot twist in color of night , since they are probably the only thing which will keep anyone watching until the bitter end . on the other hand , i'm not even sure it's necessary . color of night is so sledgehammer-subtle that it would surprise me if anyone couldn't figure out the identity of the killer in the first scene in which the individual appears . sadly , it's just one of the many ways they treat the audience like it's made up of morons . in one sequence , the killer uses a car to push another car off the top level of a parking garage , endowed with a supernatural foreknowledge of exactly where willis is going to be walking below . then there are more basic matters of stupidity , such as the condition from which the film takes its title , willis' inability to see red after the death of his patient . it has absolutely no bearing on the story , is sloppily presented through occasional perspective shots , and is just another example of the offensively simplistic psychology employed by the screenwriters . the main question is whether the true criminals are the writers or the actors . but who was the most abysmal ? the whole bunch should have their sag privileges suspended . color of night was the subject of a much-publicized battle with the mpaa over explicit sex scenes which threatened to earn it an nc-17 rating , but don't be duped . color of night is about as sexy as a lump of cold mashed potatoes , and less aesthetically pleasing . it's also extremely violent , particularly in the last fifteen minutes which includes some intensely unpleasant business with a nail gun . in 1980 richard rush clearly knew how to make a good movie . i guess directing isn't exactly like riding a bike . or in this case , like driving a garbage truck . 
screenplay : johnny brennan & kamal ahmed and james melkonian & rich wilkes . director : james melkonian . there is a regular feature in " sports illustrated " magazine devoted to examples of astounding stupidity . it is titled " this week's sign that the apocalypse is upon us . " that phrase kept running through my head as i sat through the jerky boys . somehow , two obnoxious losers had managed to parlay a fascination with juvenile humor and prank phone calls into an incredibly popular pair of audio releases and a movie deal . and the worst thing is , * none * of it is funny . the jerky boys is a terrible idea badly executed . and it will undoubtedly be extremely profitable . let us begin here : the idea of building a movie around prank phone calls is somewhat mind-boggling to begin with . the jerky boys is full of shots of phones ringing , of stationary speaker phones , of people talking on the phone . i'm hard-pressed to think of any way such a format could have been turned into riveting cinema . then again , the jerky boys never had to be riveting cinema . this is a movie about one thing , giving two idiots a chance to do their schtick , which consists entirely of insults , threats and silly voices . in a strange way , it's a little like the old elvis presley movies , in which it didn't matter what was going on in the plot , as long as elvis got a chance to sing . that was what the people were coming for . i have listened to the " jerky boys " cd , and i think it is spectacularly unfunny , but there could be some minor entertainment value in the befuddled reactions of the recipients of the calls . of course , that simply is not possible in a movie ; everyone is in on the gag , so you end up with a lot of reaction shots of actors fuming in mock frustration . and there are few things sadder than the fact that one of those actors is alan arkin . much has been and will be written about the jerky boys as not simply a bad movie , but as part of a horrible trend , the logical successor ( if logical is the word i want to use ) to the popularity of dumb and dumber , " beavis and butthead " and the like . not only does treating the jerky boys in this way give it far more sociological importance than it deserves , it insults those other examples by comparison . as bad as dumb and dumber was , at least someone was trying ; as stupid as " beavis and butthead " can be , at least they are rooted in satire . the jerky boys is simply junior high school humor aimed at junior high schoolers . it is aimed squarely at those who are guaranteed to burst into uproarious and self-righteous laughter at swishy gay stereotypes and copious expletives . if hearing someone intone the word " liverlips " several times is your idea of yuks galore , then by all means toss your $7 into the jerky boys' coffers . i suspect few moviegoers old enough to get into this movie legally will waste their money or their time . 
screenplay : tim burns & tom stern and anthony waller . director : anthony waller . mpaa rating : r ( violence , nudity , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 91 minutes . it's a truly surreal experience , sitting through a film like an american werewolf in paris with your mind overwhelmed by a piercing cry of " what were they _thinking_ ? " john landis' 1981 an american werewolf in london was hardly an inviolable classic , but it was crafty and creative , a comic horror film which was both genuinely scary and genuinely funny . an american werewolf in paris , on the other hand , is genuinely unwatchable -- a collection of bad ideas thrown onto the screen without any apparent consideration to little details like coherence or appeal to an audience . the tragedy is that director anthony waller proved he could mix tension and comic relief quite effectively in his debut feature mute witness . what follows is so misguided on so many levels that it becomes horrifying for all the wrong reasons . the male leads fumble with inane dialogue including such gen x-authentic ripostes as " this is madness ! " ; the attempts at humor range from turning a pair of undead characters into fourth-rate rejects from the frighteners , to the wildly hilarious conceit that andy -- get this ! -- keeps bumping his head on everything in sight . waller directs it all as though guided by the humanitarian desire just to get it over with , with baffling unexplained resolutions , leading to a cringe-inducing happy ending which looks like it was stolen from some mid-80s shlock comedy starring andrew mccarthy . it's all the more aggravating when a film this sloppy pretends to be interested in making some sort of social statement . the primary villains in paris are a group of pseudo-skinheads who have intentionally infected themselves with were-blood so that they might more efficiently rid french society of its contaminating elements -- vagrants , junkies , american tourists . if the point was to make americans feel better about encountering mere attitude in paris rather than flesh-rending canine teeth , mission accomplished . if waller's intent was to offer some metaphorical indictment of who-knows-what , it's lost in his frantic story-telling long before we can nod in socially-conscious superiority . some viewers will undoubtedly trek to paris simmply to see a genre film , but even they are likely to be disappointed . the computer-generated werewolves are thoroughly unimpressive , and the transformation scene tossed off so quickly you'll be instantly nostalgic for rick baker's incredible makeup effects from london . the script makes its token attempts to spice up the werewolf legend with a few new details and some pseudo-science , but none of it generates thrills or scares ( just a couple of moderately effective gross-outs ) . if they want to add a new twist to lycanthropic mythology , here's a suggestion : anyone who makes a werewolf movie this bad becomes one of them . the line to fire the silver bullets forms behind me . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
the annual animated feature aside , uncle walt's factory has taken to churning out insulting , embarrassing live-action features which stink like the flatulence they so often feature : 101 dalmatians , that darn cat , rocket man , mr . predictably , a bunch of tenuously connected action-slapstick sequences ensue . even more predictably , those action-slapstick sequences include a dose of content entirely inappropriate for the target audience . at worst , we're talking about the omnipresent smack-in-the-groin shot . i'm sure meet the deedles is going to have plenty of pre-teenagers in hysterics . it's just depressing to watch the same disney which used to bring kids goofy , harmless fare like the love bug and the million dollar duck resorting to such blantant pandering . an important programming note at this point : in no way do i consider myself " above " low humor . in mel brooks' high anxiety , a similar barrage of pigeon excrement during his parody of the birds still makes me guffaw . the problem with films like meet the deedles is that they trot out scatological gags with a weary inevitability , as though it wouldn't really be a kids' film unless someone let one rip . if that's herzfeld's idea of throwing a bone to the parents forced to squirm through this mess with their kids , perhaps a better one might have been making the slang-spewing deedles a bit more than one-joke copies of bill and ted . meet the deedles didn't have to be smart . there's a place in our multiplexes for dopey-but-innocuous family fare . the key word there would be " innocuous .

screenplay : sherri stoner & deanna oliver . producers : robert shapiro & jerry leider and mark toberoff . director : donald petrie . mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , adult humor ) running time : 93 minutes . suggestive references to " balls " and " nuts . " two references to urination . a flatulence gag . and a toilet's-eye-view of a fat guy's rear end as he bemoans eating that last burrito . welcome , friends , to the wonderful world of disney . in my favorite martian , we discover that there is intelligent life in our solar system , and that absolutely none of it was involved in making this film . continuing its impressive string of stupid and vulgar live action films , disney this time recycles the 1960s television series which starred bill bixby and ray walston . not surprisingly , my favorite martian essentially consists of a series of scenes which present the opportunity to show off special effects . and viewers who enjoy that sort of thing -- and don't have trouble with the ridiculous notion of daryl hannah as a wallflower -- will giggle blithely along . trouble is , most of those will be kids . yes , my favorite martian sports a pg rating , which clearly states that " some material may not be suitable for children , " but let's get serious here . disney has turned the company name into a license to print money for " family entertainment , " which used to mean something a parent wouldn't be embarrassed to take a kid to see . this is filmmaking not for children , but for idiots of all ages , pandering with a sense of impunity because they haven't exactly gone broke in the last couple of years by doing so . afternoon talk shows , " the hypocrisy of this film holding _anything_ up to ridicule for its stupidity or offensiveness nearly burst a large vein in my forehead . floundering in a mess like this . how much sadder still that people will pay to see it . there are maybe two harmless visual gags that work in my favorite martian , and perhaps that many examples of real wit in the script . i liked the fact that martin's molecular condenser makes a sound remarkably similar to r2-d2 when he's shot by the jawas in star wars ; the absurd parallel to e . t . 's revival also made me chuckle . mostly i sat in stony , angry silence as this aggressively brainless film dribbled towards a sequel-ready conclusion , tallying up the ways it treated viewers like pre-schoolers who laugh hysterically when they shout " doody-head " at each other . remember that list next time you trust disney's name to mean anything but mass-market infantilism . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : terri hughes & ron milbauer . producers : andrew licht & jeffrey a . mueller and suzanne todd & jennifer todd . director : rodman flender . i don't think there's a time idle hands could have been released that would have made it a good film , but its unfortunate release at this particular time makes it seem even more rancid . the hard-core first amendment advocate in me has approached most of this talk as conservative rabble rousing , but there's no defending something as brutally wrong-headed as idle hands . if this is what contemporary adolescents want to see in the movies , we really are in trouble . then mick and pnub return from the dead to provide wacky comic relief , convincing a freaked-out anton that extreme measures are required . even on its most basic level , idle hands is either idiotic or pandering , when it isn't both . naked breasts appear because , well , that's what naked breasts do in teen-oriented films . mick and pnub are the only two victims of anton's to return from the grave -- even the internal logic of the film's supernatural universe is fuzzy -- only to invite comparisons to another horror comedy , john landis' an american werewolf in london . and the gore , it raineth down like waters from the heavens . only seth green , with his wry delivery , offers a moment's entertainment amidst the stupidity . i'll head off the rebuttals of the " dude , relax , it's just a movie " contingent at the proverbial pass : yes , it's supposed to be a horror comedy , with its absurd excesses probably intentional to a certain extent . the problem is that the horror and the comedy are not combined with a knowing wink , but sequenced in a disconcerting fashion . the numbing nonchalance of the commentary lends credence to the harshest condemnations of media violence -- in this film , the ridicule isn't directed at the conventions of horror films , but at the deaths of teenagers . when characters in the film gather at a makeshift memorial to two of anton's victims , it's hard to suppress a shudder when images of columbine high school are still so fresh in our minds . of course it's a freakish coincidence that idle hands appears as it does in the wake of that tragedy , and that any of the film's images bring it to mind . it's harder to ignore turning straightforward carnage into comedy . i'm not sure whether idle hands could have redeemed itself if it actually had made a statement about the potential destructiveness of its protagonists' lives of sloth instead of celebrating same , but at least that would have been a nod to something beyond its audience's most anti-social tendencies . this film is a bad idea at an even worse time , little more than fuel for the fires of righteous indignation which , unfortunately , are seeming a bit more righteous all the time . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : ken friedman and yolande finch . director : jonathan kaplan . i'd be willing to bet that someone sold the concept for bad girls with a one-line pitch like , " the wild bunch in bloomers . " such is the way in hollywood these days . besides , with the paucity of good roles for women , talented actresses like madeleine stowe and mary stuart masterson will jump at that chance to shoot guns . the problem is that these prefabricated films almost never bring along a script . bad girls is always either hopelessly cliche or insufferably stupid--and usually both . the women and the gang of thieves repeatedly cross paths until it becomes clear that this movie ain't big enough for the both of 'em . bad girls is frequently so incoherent that i was forced to wonder whether director had chopped all the raw footage into two minute chunks , strewn them about on the editing room floor and pieced the film together in whatever order he happened to pick them up . screenwriters ken friedman and yolande finch couldn't be bothered with such niceties as explaining why eileen and lily might want to save cody ( at least anita was the one cody saved ) . there is not a second spent letting these characters interact first , so that there seems to be some kind of connection between them . apparently it's enough that they're sisters in the world's oldest profession . wild guess , anyone ? . . . the thing is that this subplot is not only cliche , it's put together in the least economical way possible , with the inclusion of kid jarrett's aging father ( robert loggia ) . this additional character just muddles the movie further ; in fact , i would go so far as to say that the inclusion of the entire josh subplot is unnecessary . but that would have left cody without a love interest , and we couldn't have that , now could we ? oh , but there's more , pardners . in the last two minutes , there is the suggestion that lily harbors a more intimate affection for eileen , something we are completely unaware of until the music swells to a tear-jerking crescendo which means nothing because we have been given no background . james legros makes an appearance as a simple homesteader who wins eileen's heart , but his is the only performance that isn't completely perfunctory . madeleine stowe and mary stuart masterson are two of my favorite current young actresses , and both are forced to spout dialogue which puts the " hack " back in hackneyed . director jonathan kaplan apparently had no idea what to do with a western , so rather than set up his own shots he tries to do his half-hearted homage to sam peckinpah , with disastrous results . whole set pieces are ripped off from the wild bunch , and kaplan's use of slow motion becomes absurdly comic . the cinematography is quite good , but a big pile of garbage is a big pile of garbage no matter what kind of filter you put over the lens . sometimes you can look at a film as bad as bad girls and see the germ of an interesting idea that was undeveloped or simply butchered , but not here . there isn't the faintest attempt to make bad girls a real examination of the plight of women in the american west ; the women are just a gimmick , unlike in the ballad of little jo . bad girls is lazy , stupid , sloppy and , worst of all , boring . they are women , hear me snore . 
screenplay : barry fanaro . producers : barry sonnenfeld and barry josephson . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , profanity , sexual situations , brief nudity ) running time : 88 minutes . some concepts are funny on paper , even if there's no way they could ever be classic comedies in reality . the crew has such a concept . sure it is . there have been other comedies about seniors turning to a life of crime rather than going gentle into that good night , like the 1979 george burns/art carney/lee strassburg vehicle going in style , but a wiseguy twist sounds promising . it may not be chock-a-block with rapier-sharp witticisms , and there may be a prostate gag or two to wade through , but there should be a few laughs , right ? there's only so much you can do to screw up a solid concept . right ? in fact , the crew screws up its solid concept so badly , and in so many provocative variations , that it's practically a road map for misbegotten film-making . ah , the wacky complications that are possible with the inclusion of a pissed-off drug lord . can you feel your sides splitting at the crazy goofy hilarity ? and can you feel a tear trickling down your cheek because bobby is really a sensitive guy , searching high and low for the daughter he hasn't seen in 30 years ? the reason the crew stinks -- or at least the main reason -- is that it's not about what it's about . a movie about geriatric mobsters could be funny . you could have them interact with their modern counterparts to show them how it's done old school , like a scorsese version of space cowboys , or focus on what kind of rackets they could run in their senior-heavy milieu . there's good character stuff there , too -- what happens when you're left to fossilize after once being part of a culture of macho action ? but the crew isn't about any of that . it isn't about anything , really , because there's so much garbage thrown into 88 minutes of script that it never develops anything remotely resembling comic momentum . director michael dinner , meanwhile , over-directs madly in compensation , operating under the delusion that you can somehow make a terrible script funny by filming everyone in fish-eye close-up . even the editing chops gags into such minute shreds that set-ups are separated from their punch lines . something this fundamentally incompetent should carry a government warning sticker . there are exactly two moments in the crew when the experience of watching it is remotely tolerable . for the other 84 minutes , the crew isn't simply unfunny ; it's a test of an audience's good will , practically an exercise in making every wrong narrative , performance or technical choice possible . it's a good pitch turned into a terrible script turned into a godawful film . actual humor from a solid concept ? see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
at those times , i wish i could become joe bob briggs , and make the recommendation to " check it out " based simply on explosions , naked breasts and cuban gangster-fu . but the specialist doesn't deserve such consideration . ponderous , pretentious and acted with astounding indifference , the specialist is a big fat bore with a couple of nice explosions . it's too somber to work as camp , and too tedious to work as anything else . much as one might expect , the specialist is being hyped on the pairing of box-office heavyweights stallone and stone . unfortunately , both of them spend most of the film looking as though they've just done a nyquil highball . at some point , director luis llosa needed to explain to stone that " haunted " and " bored " are entirely different emotions . stallone is even more comatose , conveying ray's deep reservoir of anguish and guilt through drooping eyelids and jaw muscle isometrics , as well as speaking in what can only be described as an impersonation of henry kissinger with a head cold . the rest of the cast is nearly as bad . eric roberts , typecast for most of his career as a lout-mouthed sleazeball , plays . . . well , a slightly more sedate sleazeball , delivering lines like " what i want , i take " straight out of the introduction to basic machismo handbook . and rod steiger , who was given to overacting even in his academy award-winning heyday , is appalling as the cuban godfather , doing an accent which rivals kevin costner's robin hood as the worst in recent memory . there are a couple of moments in the specialist which are worth unintentional giggles . but the specialist is simply brain-dead from top to bottom . there are almost too many examples of stupidity to single one out , but my personal favorite involves may faking her own death by tossing her wallet in with a 60-year-old corpse . i have to hand the pyrotechnics team credit for blowing up a hotel suite ; it's a fairly impressive piece of work . but that's when i should have left . come to think of it , i wish that's where i'd come in , too . 
i have a great idea for a movie , one that can't miss . see , i've got coolio to do a song for the soundtrack , and about fifty athletes and celebrities to do cameo appearances . it's about professional basketball , so i'll release it right around the nba finals to guarantee added publicity . as for what the movie is actually about . . . well , that will all sort itself out eventually . i figure it will be a comedy , so i'll throw a half-dozen writers at it and take the best of whatever they come up with . maybe we'll put a gender spin on it , see if we can get some women out to see it , too . eddie is one of those phenomenally lazy films that infuriates me more than any other kind . twister , as inane as the script might have been , at least required some creative technicians ; mission : impossible , overwrought plot and all , at least involved genuine effort . eddie just sits there , hawking up a formula story without any laughs , and makes every possible bad decision when a decision is required . please raise your hand if that comes as a shock , and i will invite you to my all-night marathon of the bad news bears , major league , angels in the outfield , the mighty ducks , the big green , cool runnings and little giants . awful teams in sports comedies make miraculous turnarounds ; it's what they do . those teams usually involve kids , for a very sound comedic reason : it's funnier when they screw up , and they're more sympathetic . those which _don't_ involve kids usually have actual actors in the lead roles , for another very sound comedic reason : they generally have developed some sort of comic timing . eddie was cast under the misguided premise that it's easier to make basketball players look like actors than it is to make actors look like basketball players . perhaps that all didn't matter to anyone because there are so few punch lines , and because the whole film is one big casting gimmick . steve rash directs the spiritless script as though waving a flag of surrender and screaming , " don't blame me , i just work here . " perhaps it was patently obvious to him that eddie isn't a movie -- it's a cameo appearance that trips over a plot every once in a while . and those are the real jokes in eddie . nothing these individuals say or do is funny ; you are supposed to be laughing simply because you notice , " hey , it's donald trump ! " or " hey , it's mujibur and sirajul ! " it's difficult to decide whether eddie is so bad because it was so shamelessly lacking in imagination or because it can't even get the cliches in a cliche-ridden genre script right . neither is frank langella , and none of the athlete-actors have the ability to give whoopi goldberg anything to play off of . that leaves her to do her street-wise miss thang routine , but with no character , no sharp lines and no help . eddie isn't just a bad movie with a formulaic premise . it's a movie that makes you feel cheated and offended , because someone came up with a poster and a marketing plan to which they had to attach an actual movie , and you had the nerve to believe it was going to be a comedy . 
right , that was a gimme . it seems that deniro has played an inordinate number of nut cases , but each one has been a distinct creation . it also seems less than coincidental that all of the aforementioned roles -- in taxi driver , cape fear and the king of comedy , respectively -- were directed by martin scorsese . scorsese knows deniro well enough , and has enough talent , to refuse to let him lapse into self-parody . the fan is an piece of hack work in which everyone involved flounders in a pointless story made even more intolerable by scott's oppressive atmospheric theatrics . that action does end up connecting the two men , a connection which doesn't make rayburn too thrilled about getting up close and personal with his fans . this is the tony scott who has ingested the simpson/bruckheimer visual motif to such an extent that he seems medically dependent on the kind of lighting which makes everyone in the film look like george hamilton ; this is the tony scott whom one suspects might never have been able to set up a shot he liked if blinds had not been invented . scott is a director who generally takes a script , actors and solid production values and grinds them into hamburger to be smothered in slow motion and a spirit-crushing soundtrack . whatever substance their might have been in the story of the fan is rendered toxic by contact with scott's " vision . " this is an ugly , ugly film . there is no great challenge involved in figuring out what the psychological underpinnings of this story were supposed to be , and that they might actually have made a decent film in some alternate reality . bobby rayburn is sane , but screenwriter phoef sutton fumbles any development in his character . the arrogant but superstitious superstar has a life which parallels gil's in ways so obvious that you can feel the elbow in your ribs -- a divorce , a young son , a perfectionist streak driven by their fathers , etc . -- but beyond those bits of trivia there is nothing to him . wesley snipes looks leaden most of the time , trying to find some kind of emotional core which just isn't there , and scott's direction steadfastly refuses to allow him the faintest hope of doing so . snipes is in trouble from the start with a character who makes no sense , but at least you might hope for some creative lunacy from deniro . sadly , what emerges instead is a performance which slaps together pieces of his superior work for scorsese . it's depressing to see deniro doing his own impression of himself . the fan is the kind of film which makes me angry enough to point out idiotic inconsistencies like overhead shots of candlestick ( now 3-com ) park which obviously were taken at 49er games , but the fact is that i don't need to . it is a film lacking a single character with whom to identify , without a single shot which doesn't remind you that its director cares more about the filter he has chosen than he does about his characters . that's right , tony scott . . . i'm 
screenplay : peter crabbe . director : bryan spicer . mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , adult themes ) here's the good news : tom arnold may never , _ever_ be allowed to make a movie again after mchale's navy . here's the bad news : everything else . bilko and down periscope as the best arguments yet for military down-sizing , trotting out the same tired cliches -- unorthodox heroes , inept commanding officers , officious little weasels getting trampled by the zany crew -- which haven't been funny since . . . well , ever . if you last the whole 105 minutes , you will experience a few explosions , a bar fight , the visage of ernest borgnine looking as though it were already preserved in formaldehyde , kids in peril , pigs in peril , and the criminal waste of bruce campbell's eccentric talents . you should also get some sort of pension ; you may be having flashbacks of this one for years . screenplay : peter bratt . director : peter bratt . there's just no way around it : follow me home is a really , really , really , really -- there just aren't enough " reallys " to do it justice -- bizarre film experience . it's not entirely appropriate to think of follow me home as a failed experiment , because it's not exactly a failure . there are some impressive performances , particularly by benjamin bratt as the wild and troubled abel , and writer/director peter bratt constantly keeps the audience off-balance with a surreal , dream-like atmosphere and characters who are never as predictable as you think they might be . but follow me home is ambitious to a fault , attempting to tackle every racial , ethnic and gender stereotype in existence in one film . the result is a film which has as its only focus the fact that it is iconoclastic , 200 years of history given a whirlwind revisionist spin in 102 minutes . when the climax involves a group chant of the sugar hill gang's " rapper's delight , " it's hard not to wonder if bratt has been spinning so hard that he's gotten too dizzy to recognize absurdity . follow me home is an admirable project , sometimes intriguing but just as deeply confused and fragmented as the america peter bratt is trying to portray . 
as a public service , i'm going to provide a simple conversion formula to help potential viewers decide whether or not they should see money talks : 1 ) begin with a base of zero on a 1-10 scale . 2 ) if you found chris tucker a riotous comedic presence in films like friday and the fifth element , add 10 points . 3 ) if tucker's every moment on screen during the fifth element made you want to tear out your own central nervous system with a shrimp fork , subtract 250 , 000 points . those individuals blissfully unfamiliar with the chris tucker oeuvre may be confused at this point . i envy such sweet naivete . tucker may be the most actively annoying screen presence since . . . well , blessed with a shudder-inducing nasal whine of a voice , tucker dares the audience to tolerate him by playing characters who simply refuse to shut up . and naturally , almost everyone franklin deals with is a complete idiot . considering the number of times franklin comments on james' posterior -- its narrowness , its whiteness , or its need to be kicked -- you'd think he might have a little crush on the fellow . in an " urban comedy , " you'd better make sure the audience knows you find " queers " even more obnoxious than white people . the amazing thing about money talks is that tucker _still_ manages to play the stupidest and most obnoxious character in the film . they also seemed thrilled every time something blew up , or every time someone got shot . perhaps that is why watching money talks was such a doubly depressing experience . not only did i have to stomach tucker's grating presence in the kind of wretched buddy comedy which makes other wretched buddy comedies look inspired , but i shared it with an audience which found high entertainment in the equivalent of rambo starring jerry lewis with tourette's syndrome . make that triply depressing : if money talks is a success , i could be sitting through another chris tucker project real soon . when you refer back to the conversion formula above , please amend item #3 to read " subtract 500 , 000 points .

director : frederik duchau . mpaa rating : g ( some scary action ) running time : 80 minutes . there are plenty of good reasons why i try to write reviews as soon as possible after seeing a film . some are purely practical , like the deadlines that stack up one against the other as friday release-date approaches ; some are philosophical , like the desire not to be influenced by any other opinions i might hear . quest for camelot has provided me with yet another reason , perhaps the best yet -- when you're dealing with a film as hopelessly bland as this one , you'll be lucky if you can remember a single detail 48 hours later . and i do mean " blah . " quest for camelot is one of the most ennervated animated films in recent memory , a lifeless conglomeration of elements each more instantly forgettable than the last . visually , it offers uninspired settings and lackluster character design until the appearance of a nifty computer-generated ogre . the comic relief isn't much of a relief at all , serving up a volley of pop culture pot shots ( taxi driver , dirty harry , friday the 13th , superman ) , banal bickering between the dragon's two heads and cringe-inducing voice casting like bronson pinchot and jaleel white . of course we also need to have songs , which means a truly awful bunch of david foster/carol bayer sager compositions alternating between middle-of-the-road piffle and soporific show-stoppers . director frederik duchau can't even manage to get his voice talent to sound vaguely enthusiastic ; brosnan reads the legendary king of the britons as though he needs a prozac far more than he needs excalibur . quest for camelot's story seems well-intentioned enough , empowering its misfit heroes despite the various obstacles to success they face . unfortunately , that's about all the story offers . the film moves with a deadening listlessness , as duchau bungles the few genuine bits of action with bizarre decisions like scoring a tense chase scene to the big love ballad . the choice of elwes as the voice of kayley's guide through the forest proves to be a huge mistake , reminding viewers familiar with the princess bride of westley's infinitely more engaging romantic adventures through the fire swamp with buttercup . eventually , the failure of the rest of the story makes even the empowerment message annoying , playing like an anachronistic scolding of the round table for including only fully-abled white male humans . as i vainly searched for something to hold my attention , i kept noticing the children in the theater wandering up and down the aisles , or engaged in conversations far more lively than anything on the screen . i can't imagine why a parent would subject their children to being bored silly by a film like quest for camelot , especially when adults will probably be bored even sillier . then again , i suppose there would be a bright side : two days later , they'll never even remember what they had to sit through . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
a message to all you aspiring screenwriters : know your genre . don't misunderstand , i'm not suggesting a writer should limit him or herself to only one genre , or that film script formulas couldn't stand a little innovation . however , there are good reasons why you shouldn't write a farce the same way you write a biographical drama . it's about pacing , about knowing your audience , about delivering the emotions the genre promises to deliver . his chosen style is arch dialogue and lots of it , which works out just fine when you're writing a comedy or an action film . a dark thriller is another cinematic beastie entirely . in the case of disturbing behavior , that critter is a great big turkey . it didn't necessarily have to be so foul a fowl . it's a nifty idea to create a creepshow out of the recognition that a teenager who's acting " normal " probably isn't . disturbing behavior , however , isn't really a creepshow . " x-files " and " millennium " veteran david nutter drags out plenty of familiar tricks ( point-of-view camera tricks , bobbing flashlights in the woods , even a score by mark snow ) , but his efforts to create mood can't get past who-cares characterizations and unexplained motivations . there's nothing frightening about the mastermind behind the plot , since he's just another one of the malicious or oblivious adults who populate films of this kind . ultimately , disturbing behavior crashes on the failure of rosenberg's script . leave aside for a moment the perfunctory romantic interest ( katie holmes ) , the forced dialogue like " self-mutilate this , fluid boy , " or the pointless extended riff in which gavin hips steve to the startling revelation that -- gasp ! disturbing behavior is simply a miserable thriller , because rosenberg rarely bothers to build any tension into his scenes . sure , he has people jump out to go booga-booga every once in a while . that doesn't add up to a second of genuine suspense , even when our heroes find themselves the next candidates for clockwork orange style " treatment . " the film merely tears along from start to finish in a brisk 80 minutes , and when it's all said and done the only thing you'll remember is how ridiculous it all is . disturbing behavior isn't a lousy thriller because it tries to be funny . " the x-files " has successfully paired satire and scares , as have the two scream films . it helps , however , if the humor supports character development , or perhaps elicits a laugh once in a while ( all right , the blue ribbons' olivia newton-john-playing yogurt shop hangout is worth a chuckle ) . no , disturbing behavior is a lousy thriller because it never tries to be thrilling . it's just a big dumb goof , cynically pitched at youth with sex , violence , loud music and a story that doesn't make a shred of sense . having made two recent films with michael bay , rosenberg's mistake is understandable . but if you're going to write an action film , you'd better not try to make it a suspense film . _that's_ scary . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : pat proft . producers : pat proft , james g . robinson and bernd eichinger . director : pat proft . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( sexual innuendo , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 85 minutes . " leslie nielsen _is_ leslie nielsen " reads a tongue-in-cheek opening credit that opens wrongfully accused , and no irony could be more bitter . once upon a time nielsen was a b-movie dramatic actor who re-invented himself as a deadpan comedian thanks to the zucker-abrahams-zucker team , who cast him in airplane ! magoo . the one-time serious actor who used to play straight man so successfully against absurdist parody turned into a self-parody , mugging ever more shamelessly as he became typecast as the prat-falling dope . you can expect more of the same -- leslie nielsen once again _as_ leslie nielsen -- in wrongfully accused , the latest in a seemingly endless string of films this summer from zaz alumni . this one , written and directed by hot shots ! i don't know whether the strained comedy of wrongfully accused would have seemed any fresher if it hadn't come hard on the heels of mafia ! and baseketball , but it certainly doesn't help . proft tries to keep the gags coming fast enough to obscure the tedium -- perhaps believing he can convince an audience that a hundred lame jokes add up to one decent one -- but the gags are worse than uninspired . they're uninspired and redundant , the kind of stuff that makes you suspect proft and jim abrahams were sitting in a room together as they were hashing out this film and mafia ! , how else to explain the fact that both films include a shot of a man leaving a lipstick print from a kiss , and a computer generated tongue emerging from someone's ear , and shots at michael flatley ? those re-cycled gags are enough to make wrongfully accused feel ridiculously tired . nielsen's performance merely compounds the misery . he has become such a flashing red light for self-defeating satire that he simply can't play the role he once played : the slack-faced observer of anarchy . directors have decided it's easier to get the audience to laugh at nielsen than it is to write anything funny to which he can react . . . or , more appropriately , _not_ react . wrongfully accused features nielsen at his least appealing , throwing out rolled eyes , grimaces and misguided reaction takes by the truckload . instead of providing an incongruous presence that contributes to the humor , he becomes a vaguely pathetic aging class clown . i realize that subtlety has never been the forte of genre parody , but there are scattered moments when wrongfully accused appears to have a decent idea that's not head-smackingly obvious . the best laugh , one i'm sure was unintentional , comes from the 30-second cameo by sandra bernhard which belies her prominent featuring in the credits . it seems like a clever jab at julianne moore's cutting-room-floor performance in the fugitive , especially when nielsen refers to getting information from bernhard's character in a scene we never see . it's probably too much to expect that level of insider satire to be sustained , especially when it's so much easier to have nielsen bang his head on a low bridge while standing on the bow of the titanic . that's about the level of humor you can expect when a film's number one comedic weapon is leslie nielsen _as_ leslie nielsen . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : roger kumble , suggested by " les liaisons dangereuses " by choderlos de laclos . director : roger kumble . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , brief nudity , adult themes , drug use ) running time : 97 minutes . in these halcyon days of 'n sync , " dawson's creek " and the like , it now seems that you can sell any pitch in hollywood by naming a piece of source material and tagging on the phrase " . . . but with teenagers . " the most recent wave may have started with clueless ( " jane austen's _emma_ , but with teenagers " ) , and has since generated such classics as the faculty ( " the thing , but with teenagers " ) and she's all that ( " pygmalion , but with teenagers " ) . so why not cruel intentions ? because it's a really lousy idea , that's why , made even worse by appalling execution . if that all sounds considerably sleazier than the original dangerous liaisons , that's only because it is . writer/director roger kumble plays most of the film as though it's soft-core porn for teenyboppers , teasing with pseudo-incestuous fondling and money-shot close-ups of gellar and blair tongue kissing . to make matters even more unpleasant , kumble even plays an interracial relationship for titillation value , and goes for cheap laughs by introducing a pointless subplot in which a stud athlete ( eric mabius ) is a closet homosexual , complete with gratuitous slurs . in a depressing case of lowest common denominator film-making , kumble has appealed to his teen audience by reducing the themes of " les liaisons dangereuses " to " everyone has sex with everyone else . " in an even more depressing development , kumble may actually have the _best_ grasp of the source material . ryan phillippe , in a valiant but grossly misguided effort to do some acting , spends virtually the entire film aping john malkovich's performance in stephen frears' 1988 dangerous liaisons . every inflectionless line reading , every arched eybrow , every lascivious double-entendre is familiar , with no apparent adjustment for the fact that sebastian is a contemporary teenager instead of an 18th century nobleman . gellar is only a bit better in the lip-curling glenn close role , while selma blair plays cecile not as simple and innocent , but with a fumbling idiocy that makes her every moment on screen unbearable . only reese witherspoon brings a shred of dignity to the proceedings , continuing to show a wonderful presence for a young actress and an interest in finding something human in her character . unfortunately , that's an interest her director doesn't share . i suppose it shouldn't be surprising that cruel intentions is just another in a long line of glossy high school audience flicks , another film with a mind-numbingly incessant underscore of shuffle-beats and pop songs , another vehicle for pretty girls and even prettier boys to pose for their fans . it is sad , however , that these filmmakers have to keep picking promising source material for their libretti , then demonstrating no concern for that material whatsoever . it's a stupid and pandering film which will probably appeal to its audience perfectly , leaving the rest of us to sit back and wait for the inevitable " moby dick , but with teenagers .

an opening title in the mod squad conscientiously defines " mod " for the viewing audience , then goes the extra mile of defining " squad " as well . it's your first clue that the target audience is that ultra-desirable -- and , apparently , lexically-challenged -- youth demographic , rather than primarily baby boomers familiar with the 1968-1972 television series . not surprisingly , the mod squad is a loud and generally stupid action film with a dose of teen-angst melodrama . impressively , it even compounds the misery with a ridiculously convoluted plot . you might think that a dense , multi-layered plot would indicate faith in audience intelligence , but you'd be very mistaken indeed . the mod squad uses its innumerable narrative threads like shiny objects to distract an infant , never really caring whether they make for a more interesting or engaging story . it doesn't even matter that many of the sub-plots drift together by the film's conclusion ; its short attention span theater mentality makes it not at all worth the effort to keep up . it's also a dim-witted and trite action film that has the nerve to wink ironically at its place in the pantheon of dim-witted and trite action films . pete ( given an off-kilter sensibility by ribisi , one of the few reasons to keep watching ) comments incredulously late in the film about " dirty cops , drug deals . . . i can't believe this actually happens . i feel like i should be saying 'i'm getting too old for this sh * t . ' " cute gag , only the mod squad hasn't earned that level of self-deprecation . despite the absence of any badge or weapon . it's the kind of film where the villains spell out their plans in more detail than james bond baddies . and it's the kind of film that truly defines gratuitious sex , violence and profanity . a bad movie can't be a commentary on the state of bad movie-making . the strange thing is that much of that formulaic foolishness could have worked if the mod squad had been played straighter as an homage to formulaic early-70s cop dramas . the only time the film is at all diverting is when b . c . smith's funky retro-score plays under a dimly lit chase scene , giving it that faux-gritty vibe . director scott silver simply can't maintain that energy , not when he's wasting time on choppy music video editing of his characters' tender personal moments . the mod squad is busy and headache-inducing , and rarely even manages to channel that into viscerally effective action . it's just another lousy piece of brand name recycling , so clearly pitched at a dumbed-down audience it's surprising that , when taking the time to define the film's title , they risked spotting us the " the .

screenplay : william davies & william osborne . director : russell mulcahy . some movies require you to turn off your brain in order to watch . then there are movies that require you to accept that everyone * in * the movie has turned off * their * brains . the real mccoy is both . it's charmless , molasses-slow and so full of genuinely stupid people that the film commission of atlanta , where the real mccoy is set , might well consider some sort of ritual suicide for their complicity in this humiliation . contrivances and sloppy plotting fly off the screen so fast and furiously you have to duck to avoid being hit by them . there is no reason given why he should need or want to get involved in another crime , let alone why he would actually participate in the break-in . but the fun doesn't end there in the shambles of a script by william davies and william osborne . there is also the absence of a single , solitary interesting character . karen is earnest and single-minded in her motherly devotion , but lacking any kind of edge which would make her a convincing criminal , and basinger is not a thespian adept at fleshing out flimsy material . only kilmer's j . t . is remotely appealing , but his one potentially intriguing quality , his ineptitude , is never developed . in fact , kilmer disappears during the middle of the film , just when his admiration for karen could have made for an interesting sub-plot . i might have been more forgiving if the pacing had been more appropriate to a caper comedy , but the real mccoy goes nowhere fast . even the reasonably clever climactic break-in falls victim to this syndrome , including a scene of one of the thieves drilling open a vault which lasts ( i kid you not ) four minutes . there is no tension in the scene , just tedium . russell mulcahy ( highlander ) is a director with some style , and indeed the real mccoy looks reasonably good , but he completely stumbles in the editing room . there are so many big problems with the real mccoy that i'm tempted to overlook the little ones . like a fountain crushed when a van runs into it reappearing in one piece a few moments later . tempted . but i'm pretty good at resisting temptation . 
screenplay : david mckenna . director : michael cristofer . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , profanity , nudity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 98 minutes . body shots opens with a profound quote attributed to " anonymous " : " i'll give you a ride/on my jelly roll/but i won't give you nothin'/from my soul . " that's about as succinct a summation as any for this lugubrious , pretentious exercise in gen y navel-gazing that follows eight single young los angelenos through a club-hopping friday night and a what-the-hell-happened saturday morning . those pseudo-profound asides -- spending long stretches on subjects like oral sex technique under the winking guise of " telling it like it is " -- are plenty bad enough to make body shots an irritating experience . it becomes positively headache-inducing when director michael cristofer starts dragging out each and every scene for all the slow-motion , lingering pause significance it's worth . characters spin in blissful kisses on the dance floor for minutes at a time , serenaded by the droning observations of their friends ; interminable silences are punctuated by someone else's equally interminable silence . it's one thing to make a movie about life's painfully uncomfortable moments . it's another to make that movie panifully uncomfortable for the people watching it . the jerky flashbacks show wildly different versions of the same event , as cristofer strains to give the tale rashomon-like credibility . both mike and sara get to stare at the floor pensively as they try to figure out exactly what they really remember , every passing second of the violent rape sara recounts feeling more exploitative because there's no reason for us to care about the people involved . the reason there's no particular reason for us to care is that these characters aren't really people . the ad campaign for body shots touts it as one of those " movies that define every decade , " but screenwriter david mckenna makes his decade-defining generalizations by making his characters single-trait generic -- shawn is sensitive , emma is sensitive in a slightly different way , whitney has a vaguely southern accent . only ron livingston , as the crew's resident eccentric , gets enough unique personality to make a comic impression ( which he does admirably in the film's few worthwhile scenes ) . the monotonous talking-head asides provide the only insight body shots has to offer into its characters , and then mckenna uses the time to blow the lid off the fact that -- gasp -- there's a sexual double-standard between men and women . with its marathon sex scenes and graphically trite narration , body shots generally feels like porn with delusions of social commentary . ultimately , it's just there to give you a ride on its jelly roll , but it won't give you nothin' from its soul . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : lawrence konner & mark rosenthal and jim fisher & jim stahl . director : penelope spheeris . joke #2 covered the expulsion of bodily gasses . the portion of the audience that was 8-12 years old , either chronologically or intellectually , howled with delight . i merely sat in astonished silence and prepared for a very long ninety minutes . the film version of the beverly hillbillies doesn't stray far from the premise of the 1962-1971 television series . the real star of the beverly hillbillies is casting director glenn daniels , who has put together about as perfect a physical match for the cast of the series as i could imagine . simply admiring cloris leachman's remarkable resemblance to the late irene ryan was enough to inspire me to grant hillbillies about ten minutes of good will . unfortunately , that turned out to be nine minutes too much . as eager as the performers seem to be to throw themselves into their roles , they're just not given anything remotely interesting to do . congratulate lawrence konner and mark rosenthal , who receive story and co-screenwriting credit , for pulling off a challenging task : coming up with a script even more pedestrian than their work in for love or money . they aim their jokes so far below the belt that they usually end up somewhere around the ankles . the addams family approach is clearly in evidence here , namely to come up with a gauze-thin story , then turn the characters loose to ham it up in comic strip fashion . the beverly hillbillies maintains a fairly consistent pattern of setup-setup-gag , setup-setup-gag , where you can see , hear and smell every one coming from several miles away . it's therefore not much of a surprise that the few really fresh and funny moments don't involve the hillbillies at all ; watch instead ( if watch you must ) for some sharp jabs at beverly hills high school students . these laughs are so rare , i won't spoil them by name . we get references to " jeopardy , " " people's court , " " barnaby jones , " and deliverance , just to name a few , and none of them are funny . spheeris seems to be making the mistaken assumption that referentiality is funny in its own right , regardless of context , forgetting that wayne's world worked because it was * about * the pop culture awareness of the twentysomethings . there's none of that goofy self-awareness in the beverly hillbillies , just a plodding , almost smug conviction that it will be a hit no matter what kind of garbage they throw at the audience . it would be nice to see them proved wrong . sadly , the beverly hillbillies seems destined to attract the same audience that made the addams family a hit , a combination of nostalgic parents and easily-amused kids . for nostalgia , watch the series in syndicated reruns for free ; for the kids , just give them a good book . they'll thank you for it later . 
starring : steven seagal , michael caine , joan chen , john c . mcginley . screenplay : ed horowitz & robin u . russin . director : steven seagal . many filmmakers need someone to be the voice of reason , and that someone is usually the producer . the need can be even greater when the filmmaker in question is a rookie director , which brings us to the first law's first corollary : be especially wary when the name appearing three times before the title is seagal . on deadly ground marks action icon steven seagal's first time in the director's chair , and it looks like it . self-indulgent and deadly dull for at least half of its running time , on deadly ground demonstrates why an ego like seagal's needs something to keep it in check . for those of you who didn't believe steven seagal could do anything more ineptly than he acts , here's evidence to the contrary . he appears to have learned nothing about pacing and exposition from his two collaborations with andrew davis , turning in an action film painfully short on action . the first hour is devoted to an overlong set-up , briefly interrupted by a barroom brawl so badly edited in places that they had to dub in exclamations so that it would be clear exactly where forrest is kicking his victims . we are subjected to a handful of soapbox speeches about environmental degradation , including one in the middle of a thoroughly pointless dream/vision sequence . however , almost none of it is inspired until forrest reaches aegis 1 , and almost invariably the editing is attrocious . lots of things blow up in on deadly ground , but there is a " so what " quality to the pyrotechnics . still , seagal at least could have had the sense to end the film with a bang , instead of with a five minute monologue about the horrors of oil companies which rivals kevin costner's jfk skreed for dramatic ineptitude . it isn't even the point that he may be right ; he's just chosen the wrong forum . of course , the ultimate problem with any steven seagal project is that it must inevitably star steven seagal . where schwarzenegger entertains with his comic book persona and one-liners , and stallone brings an underdog quality to his action flicks , seagal's squinting stoic is just boring . under siege at least had a chance thanks to tommy lee jones' lively villain , but michael caine is not in that league , playing a nasty businessman we've seen a hundred times before . john c . mcginley puts a nice spin on the enforcer role , daring to lose his cool and admit he's no match for the hero . if directing on deadly ground is seagal's idea of stretching himself , i'd offer the words of laurence olivier as advice : " just * act * , dear boy ; it's much easier .

all right , i'll admit it : i'm guilty of a bias towards writers . perhaps it's the part of me that identifies with them , or the romantic image of a guy alone in a room staring down a blank sheet of paper in a battered manual smith-corona until the paper blinks first . the fact is that when i feel a project has gone sour , the writer is frequently the last target of my wrath , and the first one to get the benefit of the doubt . not this time . i can't think of a director alive who could have done anything with cops & robbersons , or an actor who could have made it watchabel . to call this script inept would be to give it more credit than it deserves . it is exceedingly difficult to imagine what bernie somers was thinking when he started putting this mess together . there isn't a single original situation or character to be found , but that can be said of eight scripts out of ten that come out of hollywood . the more telling point is that somers didn't seem to have a clue where to go with this story . the predictable resolution would have been for milquetoast norman to discover an inner reserve of strength and end up saving the day . but even that simplistic an answer seems to be beyond his grasp . norman begins and ends the film exactly the same , and there isn't even a pat answer provided for why there is anything different in the way his family would treat him . please , my heart can't take any more surprises . the biggest losers , however , are probably the two names above the title . still , it would have been nice if he hadn't walked through the film as though he were still stunned by the cancellation of his talk show . he's not even as endearingly incompetent as the vacation series' clark griswold , just deathly boring . jack palance doesn't fare much better , but he does have an innate gruff charm that transcends the role as written ; however , that still doesn't explain why the robbersons seem so instantly drawn to jake despite his abusiveness , nor why jake eventually reciprocates . even at bargain prices , that's two bucks a laugh . * that's * a crime . 
so much for avoiding comparisons . lost souls isn't just bad because it's not as good as the exorcist . it's bad because it's yet another exercise in moody production values supporting an utterly weightless story . gifted cinematographer janusz kaminski ( who worked with steven spielberg on schindler's list and saving private ryan ) makes his directing debut with lost souls , and he trots out plenty of visual goodies to tart up the proceedings . unfortunately , they're the sort of visual goodies that just make you chuckle at their obviousness . there are jagged edits and low-angle shots intended to evoke evil through obscurity . and there are plenty of shots of slowly-dripping water , which apparently has become the standard-issue portent of satanic antics . on exactly one occasion , kaminski's freaky imagery evokes a shiver . for the other 94 minutes of lost souls , it evokes a sense of desperation . and it's no wonder he's desperate , considering the script he's working with . it's one thing for a film about the prince of darkness to be melodramatic , or overwrought , or even silly . it's quite another for it to be an outright bore . lost souls is an incredibly monotonous experience , never once working up a really good scare or a palpable sense of unease . it doesn't develop anything resembling momentum towards a satisfyingly harrowing conclusion , which makes it all-too-easy to dwell on the sluggishly paced expository scenes . ryder spends the film looking vaguely tormented , while chaplin spends the film looking puzzled and _then_ vaguely tormented , and there's no reason whatsoever to care about either one of them . it sometimes seems that every part of lost souls that could have inspired a genuinely visceral reaction has been edited out , leaving an indistinct morass of gloomy cinematography in its stead . occasionally lost souls shakes itself from its coma-inducing torpor just long enough to be aggressively dumb . at the very least , such foolishness provides a distraction the rest of lost souls can't be bothered with . there's no excuse for a movie about the primal forces of evil to make satan's influence seem so banal . lost souls could have remained on new line's shelf for another twenty-five years , and no one would have missed it . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : tim herlihy & adam sandler & steve brill . director : steve brill . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult humor , profanity , violence ) running time : 93 minutes . back in the late '70s and early '80s , burt reynolds started making movies that generally appeared to be cast parties committed to celluloid . most notably in the cannonball run films , burt and a bunch of his pals apparently got together and decided , " wouldn't it really be great if we took enormous amounts of a studio's money and then just got together and screwed around for a couple of hours ? " the result was the kind of film where it was obvious that everyone in the movie was having loads and loads of fun . viewers , on the other hand , generally found the experience about as much fun as having the cars in the film back up repeatedly over the base of their skulls . or anything funny to do . or anything to counteract the typically y2k gratuitous crudeness that makes you want to swear off ever seeing movies again . let's leave aside for a moment the fact that little nicky is based on the morally itchy proposition that we're expected to root for the survival of the devil . there's plenty more repugnant stuff in little nicky that may make you wish you too were disintegrating into a pile of special effects-generated body parts ( ideally without any sensory apparatus to take in the film itself ) . sure , we could all just chuckle about it and shake our heads ruefully about the increasing popularity of such " moron movies . " please , somebody throw me a pair of knee pads , 'cause they're aching from where i'm slapping them . of course , adam sandler fans would likely consider such a sarcastic dismissal the whining of an out-of-touch guy who just doesn't get how brilliantly hysterical sandler is . and such a predictable view might be remotely defensible if not for the fact that sandler himself is reduced to the status of straight man for most of the film . little nicky finds sandler mugging and doing the requisite silly voice , yet generally shrinking into the background while his supporting characters toss out the lame punch lines . this is a film that asks you to laugh harder at a performance by quentin tarantino than a performance by adam sandler . if you need to know anything more to keep you away , your soul is already lost . little nicky finds a brief spark of life late in the film when reese witherspoon turns up as an angel in a heaven that's more like a sorority house . the gags about giggling cherubim are at least moderately amusing , and witherspoon continues to show the comic chops that made her so good in election . you don't need to waste time being outraged by a film about a hero from hell , or by its stupidity and crass humor . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : alan zweibel and andrew scheinman . director : rob reiner . in 1987 , director rob reiner brought to the screen a satirical fantasy that was thought to be unfilmable , william goldman's the princess bride . though uneven , it basically worked thanks to a genuine sense of whimsy and goldman's own clever adaptation . the relative success of the princess bride would seem to suggest that if anyone could make a movie out of alan zweibel's goofy fable north , it would be reiner . instead , he has turned out a smug , tedious and wrong-headed mess which wraps the moral of the wizard of oz in a thoroughly unappealing package . for a few moments at the very beginning , north looks like it might be on the right track . there is a clever little sequence showing north as a brilliant student , a top athlete and a budding star of the musical theater , pitched at just the right level of low-key surreality ; a bit later , a series of parents chastise their children with all the things that " north wouldn't " do . in order for the fairy-tale one-dimensionality of these parents to work , they all need to represent something unique , not interchangeable levels of stupidity . most surprising , reiner paces everything at a crawl , including a production number in the texas sequence which should have pumped some life in the proceedings . instead , it's just another part of an 89 minute film which feels 85 minutes too long . there is yet another massive misstep with an emphasis on the subplot involving mathew mccurley as the miniature machiavelli and jon lovitz as his attorney-toady . mccurley is allowed to chew the scenery , lisping ruthless-beyond-his-years dialogue and mincing about in suspenders and slicked back hair ( as sure a sign of cinematic evil as a " 666 " tattoo ) . cringing is lovitz's forte , and he gets to do a lot of it , playing to all of his worst instincts . the youth revolt might have worked with a lighter touch , but reiner makes it too nasty , darkened further by a murder plot which engenders a pointless chase . where did so much talent go so dreadfully wrong ? elijah wood , a talented young actor , is a rather obnoxious north , taking the book's more measured nine-year-old protagonist and turning him into an adolescent packing a serious attitude . reiner probably called in every favor he had to pepper north with cameos , but they serve only to show that it's possible for an entire supporting cast to be as bored making a film as the audience is watching it . perhaps the biggest mystery of north is for what audience it was intended . it's too slow and full of dopey in-jokes to keep kids interested , and too simplistic for adults . 
screenplay : akiva goldsman . director : bruce beresford . if you have not already done so , please add to your list of movie cliches the " psychiatrist/psychologist who is as screwed up as anyone he/she is treating . " while some might argue ( and suicide statistics might support ) that this is a case of art imitating life , it is becoming far too predictable to toss a psychiatrist with personal demons into a suspense plot as flavoring ; they are the msg of the psychological thriller . surely there's a happy , well- adjusted shrink out there somewhere . well , not in silent fall , and the inclusion of that tired standby is just one of the many , many things wrong with this good-looking but gimmicky thriller . i don't think i'm breaking any new ground when i say that richard dreyfuss , talented though he may be , is a ham . and if there is anything more unintentionally amusing than watching a ham act , it is watching him try desperately * not * to be a ham . in silent fall , director bruce beresford has dreyfuss wandering around in a daze of what is supposed to be self-pity , but instead looks mostly like a particularly bad hamlet . in the one scene where dreyfuss plays dreyfuss , rattling off multiple voices in an attempt to calm tim , it's almost a relief . unfortunately , that is the level at which beresford has everyone pitch the performances ; you only know they're alive because they blink . liv tyler ( daughter of aerosmith's steven tyler in her first major role ) is lovely , but lacks any screen presence , and her big emotional scenes are truly laughable . from start to finish , silent fall is just so sluggish that i felt i was being hypnotized . it's even harder to stay awake once you realize the preposterous story that you are being asked to swallow . most ridiculous of all is tim's special talent , and not so much because it's impossible to believe his tape-recorder memory . rather , it is the mimicked voices dubbed over tim's lips which cross the line into silliness , and every time they are used they just get sillier . of course , a fundamental problem with silent fall is that it's a mystery where everyone seems too stupid to figure out the obvious . while there are moments in that relationship which work quite well , they lead to the film's single most infuriating scene , a miracle cure for tim at a crucial moment . for a film that wants to appear serious in its treatment of a perplexing medical condition , it traffics in solutions which are far too pat , and acts as a slap in the face to everyone who has ever had to live with autistic individuals by suggesting that all it takes to bring them out of it is just a little more love . 
starring : martin lawrence , will smith , tea leoni , joe pantoliano , tcheky karyo . screenplay : michael barrie & jim mulholland and doug richardson . gnaw on this factoid for a moment : bad boys was originally a project with dana carvey slated to play one of the leads . that is not a misprint . dana carvey . and if you think about it long enough , you will realize why bad boys never had a prayer of being anything more than mediocre , and in fact turned out quite bad . it is the classic case of a shell plot intended to do nothing more than showcase the star's familiar comic routine . bad boys is an amazingly boring action film , and will be funny only to fans of martin lawrence and/or will smith . i'll tell you exactly what kind of movie bad boys is . it is the kind of movie where anything that * can * blow up , * will * blow up . it is the kind of movie where glass exists solely to be shattered , either by bullets or by bodies ; in one hilariously idiotic example , a glass aquarium is mounted in the wall of a nightclub , allowing a convenient view of the inside of the men's room as well as providing a ready-made breakable item . it is the kind of movie where a misinterpreted phone conversation turns into an episode of " three's company . " and it is the kind of movie where a guy in a wheelchair gets knocked over by the villain just so you know that he's * really * a villain ( he probably doesn't recycle , either ) . don't expect much better from the characters . martin lawrence has the role with the most potential , the family man playing the part of the sexy bachelor , but he completely butchers it . the part requires someone capable of a little restraint , someone who appears uncomfortable acting smooth and seductive . that someone is * not * lawrence , who is full of swagger and attitude . falling back on his popular stand-up and sit-com persona might prove popular with his die-hard fans , but others will wonder exactly how he is supposed to be different from mike . marcus is a part that actually requires some acting ability , and martin lawrence doesn't have much . will smith * does * have acting ability , and plenty of it , but he really takes a back seat to lawrence . when he is allowed to show his frustration with the mess lawrence is making , of his house and his image , smith is quite good , and there is actually some energy in bad boys . those occasions , however , are all too rare . the simple truth is that , basically , bad boys is trying to showcase lawrence and smith the way beverly hills cop showcased eddie murphy , and a coherent plot would just get in the way of the jokes . there are clearly a lot of people who think martin lawrence is funny , but i am not one of them . while will smith can be quite funny , he becomes something of a straight man to lawrence , and that is a real misuse of his talents . bad boys is a generic action flick full of pointless slow-motion shots by director michael bay and heavy use of orange filters by cinematographer howard atherton , sporadically interrupted by lawrence and smith's profane version of the traditional buddy film odd couple . bad boys , even worse movie . 
screenplay : al franken . director : harold ramis . it is really as simple as that . we can only find evidence of a benevolent god in the fact that hans & franz the movie and coffee talk the movie were scrapped in development ( that is not a joke ) . not only is this latest " saturday night live " character spinoff incoherent and unfunny , its basic idea and tone are just appallingly wrong-headed . they had their moments , primarily because al franken is one of the few performers associated with snl in the last decade who doesn't appear to have had all his subtlety surgically removed ; indeed , his sing-song delivery is good for the film's few laughs . mostly , it's just deadly slow . what is _unintentionally_ funny about stuart saves his family is the movie-of-the-week melodrama of the smalley family segments . although there are a few flashbacks to stuart's youth which are played strictly for laughs ( unsuccessfully ) , the majority of the interactions are intended to be poignant or serious . this decision is baffling , because franken appears to have forgotten the premise behind the " daily affirmation " sketches . they were parodies of the touchy-feely self-help movement , deriving most of their humor from goofy over-reliance on new age mantras like stuart's ubiquitous " and that's . . . the schizoid combination of humorless comedy and misplaced sentimentality ( including a score by the ever-more-saccharine marc shaiman ) makes for a truly uncomfortable ride . it is clear that al franken had two basic choices when it came to making a stuart movie : keep stuart a caricature in an episodic story , or make him more real in an actual narrative . big mistake . i said franken had two basic choices . make that three : he could have chosen not to do the movie at all . _that_ would have been the smart choice . 
screenplay : david s . goyer . director : tim pope . the advertising campaign for the crow : city of angels invites us to " believe in the power of another , " but it sounds more like a plea for sympathy . after all , what are you supposed to do when you want to make a sequel but the star of the first film is no longer with us ? well , i suppose the obvious answer -- swallow your checkbook and allow the crow to rest in peace -- was unacceptable , but this is one sequel which seemed utterly doomed from the first minute . 1994's the crow was a film with a striking look , but it owed virtually every ounce of emotional resonance it had to the tragic death of star brandon lee while filming the scene in which his character is killed . city of angels has no such back story to prop up its re-tread of the first film , and seems determined to substitute excess for emotion in what has to rank as one of the year's most grueling cinematic ordeals . if there is anyone you should really feel sorry for in this mess , it is vincent perez , because i don't think he ever had a chance . this isn't like val kilmer stepping into batman's boots , or pierce brosnan taking over as 007 ; it's more like someone trying to replace patrick stewart as captain picard . perez has the right look for the part -- he looks serviceably eerie in the crow's face paint and leather duster -- but he's not brandon lee . that's not even a criticism , because i'm not convinced lee was anything that special . the point is that those who come to this film because they loved the crow are going to have a real problem with this guy with a french accent taking over for their hero . then again , i suppose perez always could have said no , especially once he got a look at a script which has him making his entrance emerging from a fountain of water in tattered clothes looking like esther williams on the way to a rave . there is plenty of silliness like that in city of angels ( it tries to stake a claim to mytho-poetic status by including a tiresias-like blind seer ) , but mostly it is an empty recycling of the crow . it's a resolutely ugly film director tim pope has put together , heavy on gratuitous s&m but light on any semblance of a point . sarah ( we assume this is the skate-punk from the first film all grown up ) serves only to give us the lovely mia kirshner to look at , and pope appears far more concerned with serving up candle-wax-on-the-nipples than creating characters . there are plenty of individual reasons to avoid city of angels ( though iggy pop makes an ideal villain for the crow since he looks like a corpse himself ) , but it's much simpler to explain why each category of potential viewer should stay away . if you did not see the first film , you probably have no interest in a dark story of vengeance with plenty of unpleasantness . if you saw the first film and did not like it , expect more of the same in city of angels , only less compelling , less artistic and more obsessed with music video theatrics . and if you saw the first film and _did_ like it , do the memory of brandon lee a great honor and do not let his death provide a producer with an excuse to build a franchise this awful on his grave . 
screenplay : larry bishop . running time : 95 minutes . it is a tough call which annoying trend represented by mad dog time is more annoying . is it the cameo-rama , the insistence upon turning every scene into a celebrity " where's waldo ? " or is it the pulp affliction , the impression that a film spilling over with kooky , garrulous gangsters must also be spilling over with style points ? writer-director larry bishop has a terrible case of both in mad dog time , a simply awful piece of pseudo-cool tripe which holds the ignominious distinction of being the 1996 heir apparent to things to do in denver when you're dead as " film most likely to make you wish no aspiring director had _ever_ seen a quentin tarantino film . " however , in trying to combine ocean's eleven with reservoir dogs , bishop has cranked out a script with so much utterly ridiculous dialogue that you might not even notice that you don't care a thing about anyone or anything in mad dog time . gabriel byrne is the worst offender , trying to make his irish accent sound like brooklyn italian while blathering on about other characters in lines which mistake simple , inane rhymes and alliteration for cleverness . with nothing to say and a truly grating way of saying it , bishop resorts to trotting out cameos of guys who don't seem to belong on the same planet , let alone in the same movie . paul anka and richard pryor ( whose appearance seems not only unnecessary , but just plain cruel ) ? it doesn't matter that none of them has anything to do except show off a skin tone which , whether natural or induced by lighting or makeup , makes many of them look like prime candidates for the george hamilton memorial melanoma wing of cedars-sinai . at times , bishop seems to be making a desperate attempt to convince the audience that he is aware of the ludicrous excesses in mad dog time , giving goldblum a couple of meta-conscious lines which refer to characters , situations or dialogue . there are even a couple of moderately inspired moments , like having dreyfuss and reynolds , owners of two of the most distinctive laughs in hollywood , cackling away as they face each other . but when a film-maker spends this much time subjecting viewers to a story which exists only as a place to put his obnoxious rat pack stand-ins and have them mouth labored , grossly unfunny lines , he loses the right to pretend it's all a lark . the actors may have had fun playing versions of frankie , sammy , dean and the boys , but that fun isn't likely to be shared by an audience . mad dog time is a self-indulgent homage masquerading as hipster cinema . worse yet , it's like the cannonball run with cocktails and shark-skin . 
director : peter hyams . mpaa rating : r ( graphic violence , profanity ) running time : 110 minutes . don't be misled by advertising which suggests that the relic is some sort of sublimely spooky thriller , because it is nothing of the kind . if you sit through the film long enough ( and several people at the screening i attended threw in the towel somewhere before the end of the third reel ) , you many begin to wonder if you have stumbled through a time warp back to the early 1980s , when horror films were an excuse to play " can you top this " with graphic depictions of murders . for all its ostensibly classy trappings , the relic is simply a mad slasher film with a monster instead of a maniac , as relentlessly violent and unpleasant as any film in recent memory . if you saw wes craven's current horror homage/satire scream , you are acquainted with the " rules " of horror films ; if you didn't see scream , you can learn most of them from the relic . splitting up a group is also a sure sign of carnage to come , especially if one person alone is carrying a flashlight or investigating any sort of strange noise . you can also count on at least one startled animal to provide a gratuitous shock to the system , to be followed closely by something genuinely horrifying . these elements are familiar for some bad reasons -- usually laziness -- but also for the good reason that , when put to good use , they can be part of a truly tense film . the original alien was a classic bug hunt crafted with such style by ridley scott that everything old seemed new again . peter hyams pretends to be interested in that kind of primal chiller , but he has neither the patience nor the skill for it . the multi-attributed script tosses personality quirks at its character hoping something might stick , but only audra lindley as an acerbic coroner seems remotely human . more often the script resorts to exposition enhancers like the two kids who turn up to ask what miller's character does for a living ( there's nothing like turning a screenplay into a catechism to make sure no one is confused ) . hyams , who has always acted as his own cinematographer , shoots everything with as little light as possible , clearly under the impression that atmosphere can be manipulated with a dimmer switch ; meanwhile , the last half of the relic is edited with a gross disregard for anything resembling building tension . the relic just gets louder , darker and more hectic with each passing minute , as hyams repeatedly confuses murky with moody . there is also something terribly dishonest about the way the relic is shot , because there is virtually nothing creepy about it . there are easily a dozen severed heads which roll through the 110 minutes of the relic , and people are torn apart with such regularity during the last 50 minutes that it no longer matters how quickly the light shines on the corpse or how rapid the edit is . at that point , the relic becomes a turkey shoot where so many anonymous individuals are killed that the survival of the two main protagonists doesn't matter . the relic is an ugly and stupid film , which is bad enough . it also proves to be a terribly dehumanizing one . 
for the record , i don't tend to put much stock in conspiracy theories . call me a starry-eyed optimist if you must , but i think people are capable of quite enough selfish nastiness on an individual basis , and that that very same selfishness makes cooperative nastiness an endeavor riddled with problems . when it comes to hollywood , however , i might be willing to make an exception . studios just may be conspiring to sap from our brains the ability to recognize clumsy stories which make only the faintest sense . by comparison to the crimes shadow conspiracy perpetrates on an unsuspecting audience , the crimes in its so-called plot seem positively benign . sheen appears to be basing his film career on playing the dupe ( he was also a patsy sniffing out dirty doings in terminal velocity and the arrival ) , but if he could be suckered into taking on a script like this , perhaps he's not doing all that much acting . shadow conspiracy , credited to the writing tandem of adi hasak and ric gibbs , appears to be the product of screenplay software , introducing hackneyed situations and characters without enough energy to make the cliches tolerable . the betrayal , the chase scene , the narrow escape . . . all the ingredients are there , but they sit there flatly without the benefit of a single moment of imagination if the basic material is bad , then the execution is even worse . the direction ( by rambo's george p . cosmatos ) and editing ( by robert a . ferretti ) in shadow conspiracy are inept to a degree that seems almost ( conspiratorially ? ) designed . one chase flashes from a luxury hotel to a homeless encampment to a sewer out of les miserables with a blissful disregard for continuity ; scenes designed for tension become inconsequential blurs , and characters wander through the narrative for an hour before you have a clue what they are supposed to be doing . cosmatos doesn't even understand basic principles of drama , making a point of showing us a tricky-to-unlatch seat-belt which then plays no further part in the story , an un-fired gun which probably sent chekhov to spinning in his grave . that climactic scene at least provides a moment of absurdist fun , the only one shadow conspiracy has to offer unless you count the floppy hats hamilton favors which are sure to gain a white house correspondent professional respect . mostly , it is just a plodding and somber piece of nonsense which seems to expect brownie points for showing us all the ways the government can keep an eye on us , and ends with an ominous tracking shot to the perspective of a spy satellite . personally , i feel more threatened by the prospect of lazy , pre-fabricated thrillers foisted off on the american viewing public as entertainment . if the people who brought us shadow conspiracy are supposed to be the ones to shine the light on sinister conspiracies which threaten our freedoms , all i have to say is : who's watching the watchmen ? 
producers : ivan reitman and joel silver . director : ivan reitman . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity ) running time : 101 minutes . i don't even need to have seen the infotainment show interviews of billy crystal and robin williams to know the substance of them . " well , " billy/robin would say , " robin/billy and i have been looking for a long time for a project where we could work together , and fathers' day seemed like the perfect opportunity . " " yeah , " robin/billy would then chime in , " we had a great time making it . " whereupon would ensue much good-natured riffing between the two , guaranteed to have the hosts chuckling merrily as we returned to the studio . for those uninitiated in promo-speak , allow me to provide a translation . the real plot of fathers' day is robin williams and billy crystal running around being robin williams and billy crystal . that plot shouldn't have been too hard to pull off . crystal and williams are funny , talented men , and the screenwriting team of lowell ganz and babaloo mandel has produced charmers like splash , parenthood and city slickers . fathers' day , however , isn't merely disappointing . it is one of the laziest and most ineptly constructed comedies of the decade . i spent 101 minutes staring at a screen in blank-faced astonishment , waiting for this group of talented people to show me something remotely entertaining . of course , i knew the answer to that question . they were thinking that they had robin williams and billy crystal , and that everything else would just sort itself out . fathers' day is filled with scenes where it looked like the script consisted of the phrase " robin does something crazy here . " it is the rare film which has made good use of williams' improvisational skills -- good morning , vietnam comes to mind . more frequently , a careless creative team like this one will use williams as a comedic " in-a-gadda-da-vida " drum solo , filling time between " fade in " and " fade out . " crystal isn't even _that_ lucky , consigned with the rest of the cast to picking up whatever scraps williams leaves behind . he plays the felix unger in this odd couple road show , maintaining the same vaguely perturbed expression for roughly the entire film . you might think fathers' day would be built around the conflict between the opposing personalities of the two leads -- crystal as the uptight lawyer and williams as the unhinged creative type -- but you'd be wrong . williams and crystal hardly raise their voices to one another , perhaps fearing that the audience only wants to see them as funny chums . respectively , they provide the opportunity to watch a mosh pit full of head-butting and a port-a-potty sliding down a hillside . thanks for coming . most critics tend to reserve their greatest outrage for films featuring pauly shore , chris farley or even jim carrey , perhaps believing that moronic physical comedy is what's wrong with modern film-making . i consider fathers' day more contemptible by far . whatever else one might think about farley or carrey , they give everything they've got to a role . the performances are lifeless , the plot incorporates that over-used trope of the workaholic who gets religion about family life , and the dialogue is so devoid of creativity that it re-cycles a gag about the odds of lou gehrig dying of lou gehrig's disease ( comparative stories about how long ago you first heard that one mailed to this address , please ) . i'm sure the stars had a wonderful time making fathers' day , just like burt reynolds , dom deluise and company had a wonderful time making those cannonball run movies . as the credits started to role , i began to hope that fathers' day would include out-takes , something to justify my time . they also would have provided a fitting post-card coda for a film which amounts to a working vacation for robin williams and billy crystal at our expense : " having a good time -- glad you were there .

screenplay : jill mazursky cody and jeffrey abrams . mpaa rating : pg ( mild profanity , violent situations ) running time : 92 minutes . i was sitting next to a laugher as i watched gone fishin' . when i say " laugher , " i don't just mean someone who laughs loudly , or someone who laughs frequently . i mean someone who laughs loudly _and_ frequently . the most innocuous line of dialogue was greeted with a hearty chuckle , while a full-fledged sight gag inspired the kind of explosive bellow which i was certain would cause a loss of bladder control . if disney had test-screened gone fishin' for an audience comprised entirely of clones of this fellow , the champagne corks would have been popping like bubble wrap in the hands of a 10-year-old . under most circumstances , the laugher would have annoyed me to distraction . in the case of gone fishin' , the distraction was welcome . the film's breathtaking awfulness forced my mind to wander in sheer self-defense , leading me to spend a lot of time thinking about what a splendid time the laugher was having . as a critic , it is sometimes useful for me to confront how uniquely personal the movie-going experience can be , particularly when it comes to comedy . in my world , gone fishin' was a complete catastrophe . in the laugher's world , it was an unqualified delight . there's certainly nothing inherently clever about the premise . and that , ultimately , is what gone fishin' is about . in other words , it's in the tradition of the slapstick-y live-action comedies disney made when dean jones and kurt russell were foiling the nefarious schemes of joe flynn and cesar romero in various permutations . at least those concoctions were fast-paced and enthusiastically silly . for every two minutes of action in gone fishin' there are at least twenty minutes of inane chatter between pesci and glover . the two are supposed to be lovable , incurably optimistic simpletons , but someone forgot to spend any script time on the " lovable " part . joe and gus are dull , immature and , worst of all , they simply refuse to shut up . thoughts of the three stooges led me back to the laugher , and his enjoyment suddenly made a lot more sense . it's actually a bit of an insult to the stooges to compare them to the ponderous shenanigans of joe and gus , except to note that the audience may find the mayhem similarly appealing . the less stooge-inclined may consider them nothing but a pair of foreheads waiting for a swinging two-by-four . now _that_ would be comedy . 
i have a theory that , in an earlier stage of development , the premise for a simple wish went something like this : murray ( martin short ) , who aspires to being the first male fairy godmother , turns out to be completely inept at the job , but an affirmative action mandate forces the godmothers to admit him . this would be before the real-world affirmative action debate heated up , forcing controversy-shy universal executives to drop that angle entirely . the theory , i'll admit , is based on no evidence in the version of a simple wish which actually made it to the screen . the alternative , unfortunately , is that the story never made a shred of sense at _any_ point in its development . it's the kind of exasperating kiddie fantasy where stuff just happens , without any character , story or internal logic to guide it . of course , the stuff which does happen may be plenty to satisfy young viewers . the special effects are , admittedly , temporarily distracting . martin short , who should be taken only in small doses even on his best days , turns murray into a flinching , snorting and generally annoying creation without a glimmer of charm . mara wilson , who was so appealing in last year's delightful matilda , barely registers here at all , while francis capra registers far too often as wilson's big brother . there is not a single likeable character in the film , turning every scene into a long wait for some kind of goofy visual effect to snap you out of your stupor . all of these problems make the gaping hole at the center of the film all the more evident . a simple wish is based around a high-concept premise -- a male fairy godmother , and an incompetent one at that -- yet not once is there any attempt to explain why he wanted to be a fairy godmother , how he managed to become one , or why no one is keeping an eye on him . in fact , a simple wish is comprised of nothing but missed opportunities and half-developed ideas . does it matter that murray is using a broken wand for much of the film ? time and again , a simple wish wanders from scene to scene as though blissfully unconcerned about arriving at anything resembling a point . then again , maybe someone got cold feet and stripped it of its point . it's more charitable , i think , to imagine the darkly satirical film a simple wish might have been than to dwell on the muddled mess it turned out to be . calling a critic 'elitist' is like calling an accountant 'mathist .

screenplay : kevin meyer and keith samples . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , sexual situations , profanity ) running time : 95 minutes . a plot synopsis for a smile like yours reads like the most generic of bittersweet romantic comedies . sounds quite a bit like she's having a baby , doesn't it ? only it's more like she's _not_ having a baby , because a smile like yours is a bittersweet romantic comedy about infertility . that's right , all the wacky hijinks of masturbating into a cup ! all the side-splitting humor of spending an hour in stirrups ! i can understand the temptation to search for humor in a subject as frustrating , embarrassing and occasionally guilt-inducing as fertility problems . perhaps either writer/director keith samples or his co-writer kevin meyer had some personal experience in this area , and felt the need to share their quest for a smile amidst the tears . and it might have worked if they had bothered to include a single honest moment in a smile like yours . there is no attempt to understand how danny and jennifer really feel about their dilemma , no sense of any genuine pain . samples and meyer have merely grafted a few scenes at a fertility clinic onto a fluffy and absurdly predictable relationship comedy , forcing you to wonder why it couldn't just as easily have been about a couple struggling with financial problems , or an irritating relative , or the heartbreak of psoriasis . it's actually fairly impressive how generic and predictable a smile like yours turns out to be . the casting certainly doesn't help matters , offering the mundanely attractive kinnear and holly as our protagonists without once stepping inside their heads ( we never learn why jennifer is so underhanded about trying to get pregnant , considering danny seems perfectly comfortable with the idea ) . even the supporting cast -- jay thomas as the acerbic guy pal , joan cusack as the daffy gal pal -- appears to have been generated by a computer program . the film is so ennervated for so long that a late cameo by shirley maclaine provides virtually the entire energy quotient in three minutes of screen time . for an hour and a half a smile like yours trudges in the most obvious directions , reaching a grating climax in a scene where several agonizing seconds pass between the moment we _know_ jennifer is going to call danny's hotel room and find another woman there , and the moment the phone actually rings . infertility may be a delicate issue , but it's hardly sacrosanct . a competent film-making team might have made either an exaggerated black comedy or a more sensitive comedy-drama about the issue . it deserves much better than to become an afterthought in a story which has nothing creative or insightful to offer on any subject . you know you're in trouble when the biggest laugh in a film comes during a scene when a character is watching a rerun of " i love lucy " . . . and the laugh is actually _at_ the rerun of " i love lucy . " lucy is still funnier -- and more inventive -- after 40 years than a smile like yours is after 40 minutes . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : jeb stuart and philip morton . director : felix enriquez alcala . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 98 minutes . in an uncertain world , there's something strangely reassuring about the films of steven seagal . the economy may rise and fall , but seagal will always dispatch all adversaries with the same vaguely bored smirk and without a hair in his ponytail drifting out of place . you can't depend on political institutions , but you can depend on the fact that seagal will put together a wardrobe where nary a pastel nor a t-shirt will be found . all else changes , but seagal stays the same -- the same facial expression , the same tone of voice for every emotion , the same humorless self-importance . he is stasis personified . there's not much new to say about fire down below , because there's not much new to see . and none of those bones ever belong to seagal's character . a seagal fight sequence is uniquely monotonous not just because the hero always wins -- action heroes usually win -- but because no one ever lays a finger on him . i doubt seagal will ever make a truly thrilling action thriller ( and yes , that includes under siege ) because his ego could never permit any doubt as to the outcome ; his action scenes are like harlem globetrotters games without the showmanship . it's that ego of his which makes so many seagal films so wonderfully , terribly predictable . when he stops fire down below dead in its tracks to give a mini-version of his on deadly ground speech on environmental responsibility , you know it's because he genuinely believes someone cares what he thinks on the subject . -- you know it's because he's not about to take orders . and when he tries to work up some sensitive romantic chemistry with marg helgenberger , you want to laugh out loud at the idea that he could love anyone as much as he loves himself . sure , you can always count on a few token surprises , most of them completely ridiculous . there's a needless and unpleasant subplot about incestuous siblings -- nothing like dismantling appalachian stereotypes -- and a few colorful bursts of conveniently fluorescent toxic goop . mostly , however , there's more of the same fight-chase-explosion narrative structure and automoton emoting which makes the latest steven seagal film a natural sequel to the last steven seagal film . there's nothing remotely entertaining about fire down below , but there's something steadying about seagal's artistic intransigence . in turbulent times , you can almost take comfort in the knowledge that one man's name is as good as a plot description . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : peter atkins . producers : pierre david , clark peterson and noel a . zanitsch . director : robert kurtzman . mpaa rating : ( graphic gore and violence , profanity ) running time : 88 minutes . prior to that point , cinematic horror was generally restricted to innocuous creature features and the occasional genuine thriller ( psycho , the haunting ) which was more in your head than in your face . the phenomenal success of the exorcist changed all that , giving rise to the notion that the way to shake up an audience was from the stomach out . there was even one teen scream film , happy birthday to me , which trumpeted in its ad campaign that it contained some of " the most bizarre murders you will ever see . " wishmaster , a limp and generally tedious horror film about an ancient djinn ( andrew divoff ) accidentally released into modern-day america by a jewelry appraiser ( tammy lauren ) , would have no reason to exist if not to show off a gaggle of grotesqueries : skin flayed from flesh , a skeleton tearing loose from its body , eviscerations by the cartload , cancerous pustules erupting on a pharmacist's skin , all manner of creepy-crawlies emerging from the orifices of human hosts , a face indented by an iron mace like something out of a warner bros . cartoon , and a few garden-variety shootings for street cred . director robert kurtzman -- a former special-effects man handed a basic premise for a story ( an ancient djinn loose in modern-day america ) , a budget and an r rating -- occasionally stumbles across an innovative visual idea which doesn't involve exposing anatomical features generally hidden from view . more often , when in doubt , he lets loose with the red karo syrup . wishmaster also wouldn't exist without a few noteworthy antecedents like " the man in the bottle " episode of the original " twilight zone " and " the monkey's paw . " screenwriter peter atkins seems convinced that his notion of a malevolent genie is wildly original , and that the idea of that genie providing literalist renderings of vague wishes is positively ingenious . an original idea isn't necessary when you can take an old one and spice it up with state-of-the-art viscera-spilling . like far too many supernatural horror films , about half of wishmaster's exposition seems devoted to explaining the detailed rules for how the monster wreaks his havoc , how he can be destroyed , etc . the good news is that that exposition provides a few memorable moments for jenny o'hara , sharp and sassy as the occult expert every monster movie needs . the bad news is that the whole business is pointless , a foolish stab at internal logic in a genre where internal logic matters far less than what kind of mayhem a djinn can inflict when someone wishes for a " wild party . " horror films can work when the people who make them display a sense for the giddy catharsis of a good scare , but there's nothing scary about wishmaster unless you count the half-dozen or so times the music cranks up to a decibel level just this side of the concorde . it's just a humorless display of special-effects prowess , the latest installment in the ongoing game of " can you top this ?

the obvious question associated with the creation of home alone 3 is " why , " though not for the obvious reasons . you'd certainly expect a third installment from a series where the first two racked up a collective $457 million , even if the star of those two films has been spending more time lately in court than on screen . it's just that home alone guru john hughes has been doing a perfectly serviceable job of re-cycling that successful formula without using the home alone name . baby's day out , 101 dalmatians and flubber have managed to turn pratfalls , scatology and groin injuries into cash without conjuring up the yelping visage of macaulay culkin . why indeed , especially if you're going to fumble the formula the way home alone 3 does . the required elements appear to be in place -- a youngster ( alex d . linz as alex pruitt ) , absentee parents , a snow-covered midwestern suburb , nefarious intruders , several severe bodily injuries and property damage in the six-figure range -- but everything feels just slightly askew . and the direction by raja gosnell , taking over for chris columbus , drags the pace so badly during the first hour that kids may be snoring long before they chuckle for the first time . now , no one has ever accused me of championing john hughes' modus operandi in the 90s , when he lost all interest in films for viewers over the age of 10 . in fact , i'm pretty sure it's one of the biblical signs of the end-times . but let's face it -- the formula works . home alone 3 includes all of hughes' most annoying habits -- cloying sentimentality , utter disdain for adults , crotch-level comedy -- with little of the mitigating frivolousness . the road runner turns into a rhodes scholar , wile e . coyote into a james bond villain , and the trip-hammer pacing something more suited to merchant ivory than chuck jones . of course , i can't recall a merchant ivory film which included so many different things dropped on people's heads . the villains in home alone 3 are brained from above with books , barbells , decorative flower pots , a lawn mower , lumber and human excrement , among other things , which nick glennie-smith's relentlessly whimsical score reminds us is jolly good fun . certainly all the mayhem will keep the kids giggling , assuming you rouse them from their naps , but there are so many different ways to see exactly the same material with more energy and at significantly less cost . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : stephen peters . director : john mcnaughton . mpaa rating : r ( adult themes , sexual situations , nudity , profanity , drug use , violence ) running time : 113 minutes . if hollywood is going to insist on making awful films , the least it could do is make them as wonderfully , hilariously awful as wild things . there is a kind of zen preposterousness certain films achieve -- oh , let's use showgirls as an example -- which makes them too much fun to dismiss . they become impromptu " mystery science theater " experiences , where you find yourself hooting and commenting throughout the ridiculous situations , plaster-of-paris acting and quotably appalling dialogue . i'm not entirely sure that wild things isn't a huge , self-aware joke , attempting to combine the joe eszterhas oeuvre ( showgirls , basic instinct , jade ) and grade-z exploitation films bursting with busty women in the swamps . for the next 100 minutes or so it spins off into a dozen different twists and turns of double-dealing , accompanied by the kind of non-stop sleaze which would make eszterhas proud . soap opera threats snarled through clenched teeth ? yep . career-threatening performances ? you betcha . check . chicks in wet t-shirts ? check . gratuitous full-frontal shower shot of detective ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) which reveals -- ahem -- just precisely how many degrees of kevin bacon there are ? and yet , as undeniably wretched as virtually every moment of wild things is , i can't imagine anyone walking out on it . the same kind of perverse i-only-read-it-for-the-articles voyeurism which finds otherwise sensible people pausing when they flip past jerry springer could have you shaking your head and giggling non-stop . in fact , the pseudo-serious but scandal-grubbing television coverage of lombardo's trial in wild things serves as an apt metaphor for what we should be expecting from the film . there's no way to take wild things seriously as a movie , any more than it's possible to take " melrose place " seriously as topical drama or " hard copy " seriously as journalism . it's a lowest-common-denominator side show of all the stuff we mock with knee-jerk superiority , yet still manages to do gangbuster ratings . it is only a tremendously entertaining supporting turn by bill murray which makes it hard to forgive wild things all its trespasses . as lombardo's ambulance-chasing attorney , murray brings a genuine comic touch to the proceedings , one which doesn't force you to stop laughing to figure out whether the humor is intentional . even the film's extended closing credits coda , which back-tracks to explain how all the plotting comes together , feels like a huge miscalculation . if it matters that much whether or not the plot makes sense , then wild things really _is_ that bad . perhaps it's just the eternal optimist in me which makes me want to believe there was a logic behind the perverse inanity -- or perhaps that's inane perversity -- of wild things . or perhaps it's the need to find a reason why i'd rather sit through a film as bad as wild things again before i'd sit through a " better " film like twilight . i can't even call it a " guilty pleasure , " because it's not the film i enjoyed . i did , however , immensely enjoy the act of _not_ enjoying it . start-to-finish trash just doesn't get much trashier than this , unless a certain writer's name is attached to the script . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : silvio horta . mpaa rating : r ( violence , sexual situations , profanity ) running time : 100 minutes . hey , did you ever hear the one about the really good post-scream teen horror film ? it seems that some film-makers , realizing there was a new market to be tapped after the success of scream and its sequel , decided to make an even better variation on the theme . the script was intelligent , the obligatory pop culture asides felt more than obligatory , and the suspense was genuinely scary . it was both fresh _and_ frightening . no , really , it actually happened . a friend of my cousin's sister-in-law actually saw it . sorry , friends , but the preceding is a myth -- an urban legend if you will , exactly the kind which forms the basis of the film of the same name . if you actually care about the answer to that question by the end of urban legend , it will only be to see how convoluted the explanation could be . like too many recent horror films , this one obliges you to play name that killer , without giving you enough information to permit anything but a random guess . and if you think abut the revelation for long enough afterwards , you'll realize it just doesn't matter . stop wasting our time ; this is a slasher film , not agatha christie . frankly , it's about time slasher films started acting like slasher films in plenty of ways . ever since scream ( or even wes craven's earlier new nightmare , if you wanna be picky ) , horror films have gone all post-modern on us , eschewing grind-it-out gore in favor of winking recognition of genre conventions . urban legend's pop culture nuggets range from the acceptably smirky ( a snippet of the " dawson's creek " theme played when " dawson's creek " cast member jackson turns on his car radio ) to the who-cares ridiculous ( naming one character after one of the film's producers ) , and those are only a couple of examples of the strained reaches for gags in silvio horta's script . there's just not enough humor or creativity to compensate for the raw terror lost in forced attempts to be cute . aside from the effective prologue sequence , urban legend misses the boat on providing gut-level scares . ironically enough , it also misses the point that most of the late 70s/early 80s slasher films these arched-eyebrow cousins goof on were actually moralizing cautionary tales , just like the ones described by englund's folklore professor . urban legend nicks from the cine-literate horror of scream without even realizing it , because movies _are_ our urban legends . pity the talented alicia witt ( late of tv's " cybill " ) for getting caught up in a horror film that's not clever enough or scary enough to succeed as anything but a clutch-your-date friday night special . urban legend is a tale too often told . and as one character in the film says , " if you're going to tell the story , at least get it right .

screenplay : will ferrell & chris kattan and steve koren . director : john fortenberry . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( sexual situations , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 83 minutes . as evidence of my exodus from the land of hip , i offer the confession that it's been about three years since i've seen an episode of " saturday night live . " the show that used to be cutting edge had turned into a pop culture butter knife : dull and pointless . if a night at the roxbury is any indication , i haven't missed much from " snl " other than an attempt to recapture past glory by regurgitating old premises . steve ( will ferrell ) and doug butabi ( chris kattan ) , the socially intept , utterly oblivious night-clubbing l . a . siblings whose attempts to " score " from one of the film's plot lines , are pretty familiar creations . you say tomato , i say tomahto ; you say " foxes , " i say " babes . " i'm not suggesting that a film based on the czechoslovakian brothers necessarily would have been funnier than this one . it's almost axiomatic at this point that trying to turn a five minute sketch into a full-length feature is a very , very bad idea ( particularly when those five minute sketches are only funny for the first two ) . the fact is , it's briefly amusing watching the butabis' synchronized head-swaying to the beat , or listening to them spew out decrepit pick-up lines . but the rest of a night at the roxbury demonstrates exactly what kills sketch-to-feature concepts : once the sketch material is exhausted , you've got to humanize characters that are much funnier as broad caricatures . when a night at the roxbury isn't just plain boring , it's actually kinda sad . in case the taut visage of loni anderson wasn't frightening enough , the film wheels out richard grieco as himself , doughy and mascara-covered . the idea that grieco still carries enough clout to get our loser protagonists into the ultra-exclusive roxbury is one of the film's best jokes ; dana carvey would have dismissed him in an old " snl " sketch with an admonition to " wait at the bar . " and it's saddest of all being a member of the audience watching the script scramble in search of a concept on which to hang something vaguely humorous , and watching director john fortenberry's clunky comic pacing . ultimately , there are about five decent laughs and another handful of chuckles in a night at the roxbury , and i was counting those in the stony audience around me , not my own . i'll give ferrell and kattan credit for a clever combo-poke at say anything . . . and the graduate , and i'll give major credit to the music supervisor for coming up with great song cues for a number of scenes . otherwise , a night at the roxbury continues two noteworthy " saturday night live " traditions : loser brothers infatuated with trendy night-spots , and generally unwatchable feature films . looks like i could pick up right where i left off . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : mark rosenthal & lawrence konner . mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , violence ) running time : 110 minutes . mighty joe young gives the most noteworthy performance in mighty joe young , which is only to be expected . after all , like the dinosaurs in jurassic park or the tornados in twister ( another film in which bill paxton is upstaged by a special effect ) , the big ape is the only reason anyone might want to see the film . in this big-budget remake of the 1949 ersatz king kong , a combination of monkey suit , computer animation and electronics replace ray harryhausen stop-motion to provide a more versatile range of emotion . the goal was a sympathetic simian , a 15-foot ton o' love you couldn't help but cheer for . all evidence suggests that making joe a crowd-pleasing character was all anyone involved in mighty joe young cared about -- and they couldn't even get _that_ right . mighty joe young can only work on a story level if joe is not a monster but a sensitive , misunderstood stranger in a strange land , like a hirsute e . t . unfortunately , there is not a shred of internal logic to joe's personality . at times , he's a big playful kid ; at other times , for no apparent reason other than a cheap laugh , he's a super-intelligent beast who shakes his head ironically and escapes from pursuers with cleverly-executed diversionary tactics . even joe's situational sense of morality makes it hard to care about him , as he dispatches villains with the kind of ruthlessness you'd expect of james bond , not the furry hero of a disney movie . joe's not a character -- he's a contrivance , manipulated by technicians for whatever tone suits the needs of the moment . that leaves the human characters , and oh what a scary mistake that turns out to be . charlize theron is a tremendously appealing actress , but she's instantly ridiculous traipsing around the jungle in a designer coiffure ; bill paxton fares little better as the earnest , bland hero you expect at any moment will scold the villain with " he's in it for the money , not the science . " they get to wander together in a couple of canned romantic interludes so absurd you'll want to shoot yourself in the thigh with a tranquilizer dart . there are plenty of viewers to whom none of this will matter in the slightest , provided mighty joe young delivers its share of family adventure . in fact , it works sporadically on that level , with a couple of lively chases and some whoop-it-up destruction on hollywood boulevard . i'm just not sure what kids will make of the violence joe inflicts on innocent bystanders , or his streak of homicidal vigilantism . it's telling that the film has to put a child in jeopardy in the final ten minutes to make joe's noble heart evident , and have the child plead for the ape's well-being with a wide-eyed " is joe gonna be all right ? " all the film-makers needed to do for mighty joe young to work on a basic level was make it easy to root for joe . instead , the only character that matters -- in a disney film , no less -- is an unstable , ill-defined murderer . say it ain't so , joe . . . say it ain't so . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : kevin williamson . director : robert rodriguez . there's something very strange going on at ohio's herrington high in the faculty . a world-shaking case of deja vu . deconstructionist screen scribe kevin williamson managed a tightrope act across the fine line between homage and outright theft in scream and scream 2 . in the faculty , he stomps that fine line into a fine paste . it's a monster movie that could not exist without the existence of other -- and much better -- movies . of course , some will argue that such is entirely the point of any williamson project , that he shows off the conventions of genre films so he can revitalize them . the problem is that there is nothing remotely revitalizing about the faculty . sure , it's a movie movie , but its quotes are as witlessly regurgitated as in any number of recent leslie nielsen projects . instead of having something clever to say about cliches , it simply recycles them , tossing in the occasional reference to " the puppet masters " or alien's ripley as though it suddenly makes all the trite characterizations and profanely insult-filled dialogue tolerable . even elijah wood's wide-eyed genuineness and some pseudo-analysis of teenage desire for conformity can't rescue the faculty from feeling exactly like the " attractive teens in jeopardy " tales it supposedly derides . if the faculty proves anything , it's how much williamson needs wes craven . both scream films featured chilling sequences which could stand with the best the genre had to offer ; they showed what chould be great about horror films even as they showed what could be awful about them . robert rodriguez -- who , if nothing else , has always shown that he has an electrifying sense of cinematic pacing -- seemingly has no idea what to do with this material . the faculty drifts sluggishly from character to character as though they actually mattered , and the few action sequences are designed to show off alien effects . every opportunity for genuine creativity is turned into yet another self-satisfied commentary on how every science-fiction story is really a rip-off of some other science-fiction story . there are a couple of amusing moments in the faculty -- a football game in which the herrington team " infects " the opposition during dogpile tackles , for instance -- but even most of those are taken from other films . williamson's name is supposed to make this a knowing satire of alien takeover films like invasion of the body snatchers , but there was more inventive humor in a piece of cheese like 1985's killer yogurt film the stuff . the faculty merely adds to the list of lame science fiction films for someone else to satirize . . . and maybe even get it right next time . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
director : robert iscove . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 91 min . like no other fairy tale set-up , it sets a modern sensibility to itching -- how does one respond to the idea that a woman must be physically transformed to be worthy of love ? if there's anywhere you can sell the idea that _everyone_ believes they must be physically transformed to be worthy of love , this would be the place . so much for the sociological context -- she's all that stinks like last month's cheese left on a particularly sunny windowsill . i'm sure that all parties involved in she's all that thought they really were telling a cinderella story , particularly director robert iscove , who helmed the popular tv-movie version with brandy a couple years back . rachael leigh cook wears her horn-rims like someone trying desperately not to appear beautiful despite her porcelain features , somewhat dampening that willing suspension of disbelief . there's little if any chemistry between prinze and cook , no development of what would make their mutual attraction grow . . . in short , nothing that would appeal to a viewer not of the same age as the protagonists . essentially , however , she's all that isn't remotely interested in appealing to anyone outside that audience , because it's really a teen fantasy . for girls , it offers the prospect that , even if you're a social pariah now , you too can turn into a popular beauty with the right haircut and a sympathetic stud by your side ; for boys , it suggests that anyone is a hottie waiting to happen if you point her in the right direction . and in between , it derives belly laughs from people eating pizza sprinkled with pubic hair . it's humorless and derivative , but it _understands_ you , fellow high school student . like john hughes crossed with bill clinton , she's all that feels your adolescent pain . thank heaven for matthew lillard , who invests his spin on " real world's " puck with enough egotistical energy to rouse she's all that from its stupor periodically . his scenes , including a manic look-at-me dance at a party , are about the only aspect of the film not pasted together from every other teen angst-comedy you've ever seen . this one compounds its tedium with a near-suffocating boredom , as iscove can't even generate energy to drive its familiar narrative forward . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : bob brunner and garry marshall . director : garry marshall . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( sexual content , adult themes , mild profanity ) running time : 127 minutes . i never bought dustin hoffman as an autistic savant in rain man . tom hanks as slow-witted forrest gump was all vocal mannerisms . kevin bacon in the soon-to-video digging to china seemed to be mimicking pee-wee herman . movie stars trying to play mentally handicapped characters do so for any number of reasons -- the parts are juicy , the challenge is unique , and ( if two of the three above examples are any indication ) the chance for an oscar is pretty good . clearly plenty of viewers ( and other critics ) eat up such portrayals with a spoon . i generally spend two hours watching a movie star failing miserably at suspending my disbelief . the other sister is a ghastly exercise for any number of reasons , but the primary reason is juliette lewis . leave it to director garry marshall to make a tv-movie look like a paradigm of subtlety and sensitivity . the story leaps from episode to episode in search of a consistent tone , dragging its fine cast through the muck along the way . they're the worst kind of hollywood character constructions , sit-com versions of mary tyler moore and donald sutherland in ordinary people . and the wacky premise for that sit-com just isn't funny . i'm sure that everyone involved in the other sister felt they were making a heart-warming tale of triumph over adversity , which it very well might have been if there seemed to be a shred of authenticity to the situations . lewis is a large part of the problem , and not necessarily because she does such a terrible job . it's somehow easier to buy ribisi , though his performance certainly isn't light-years beyond lewis's . juliette lewis , however , is always juliette lewis , from the first minute she's on screen until the last , an actress trying to convince me she's a mentally handicapped person . watching lewis screw up her face and twist her dialogue becomes like watching a white actor playing a character in blackface -- not just a case of miscasting , but wrong on a gut level . that reaction isn't mitigated by a script which , frankly , draws nearly every one of its laughs from the goofy behavior of its handicapped characters . viewers may kid themselves into thinking they're laughing good-naturedly at the struggles of these characters to be more like " normal people , " but every gag is really at their expense . the other sister is a sideshow masquerading as a feel-good tale -- see the handicapped kids trying to figure out sex ! see them get drunk and say inappropriate things ! indeed , the other sister stands as a shining example of all that can go wrong in a film about mentally handicapped people . in the rare examples that have worked -- leonardo dicaprio in what's eating gilbert grape , tom hulce in dominick and eugene -- you felt someone was telling a real story of which handicapped characters happened to be a part . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
director : jon amiel . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 114 minutes . at least entrapment lets you know what your in for from its opening shot , a sweeping helicopter approach over water towards the new york skyline . it's a shot that has opened many a recent film , one of those showy mood-setters of which imagination-impaired directors are so very fond . of course , you can't expect much more from a director when he's working with imagination-impaired writers . there are movies that repulse you , movies that enthrall you , and then there are movies that just plug away joylessly to fill a genre slot on a release schedule . not even other _good_ movies . it's possible that entrapment could have gotten away with being just a heist thriller ; the elaborately choreographed break-ins are decently crafted , and offer at least an occasional whiff of tension . unfortunately , the script -- credited to ron bass and william broyles , but actually the work of several more -- wants to cast gin and mac as star-crossed lovers , kindred spirits divided by their hidden agendas . it's a thoroughly failed attempt , since the characters are kept so enigmatic that it's never possible to understand their attraction , and their exchanges are so leaden that they might as well have the pages of the script on the table in front of them . meanwhile , the pacing grows so lugubrious as gin and mac exchange loaded glances that you're likely to nod off between break-in set pieces . the other option for a viewer is to use that time to play spot the cliche . be sure to have your pad and pen ready from that opening helicopter shot , because entrapment appears to be the product of a script-o-matic . from the b-follows-a dialogue exchanges ( she : " there won't be any surprises . " thank heaven for ving rhames' vaguely menacing performance , and maury chaykin's bizarre sidney greenstreet-meets-truman capote crime boss , or there might not have been a second of entrapment worth remembering a day later . it's designed to be swallowed without chewing . i suppose that's partially to avoid giving anyone in the audience reason to ponder the jaw-dropping gaps in logic . entrapment ends with one of those " betcha didn't see that coming " conclusions which , frankly , i _didn't_ see coming . i'd also long ago given up caring , especially when the behavior of the characters at certain points in the film makes no sense whatsoever when compared to what we eventually learn about them . you can only forgive that kind of laziness-disguised-as-cleverness if a film has been working hard to entertain you , to keep you engaged from start to finish . entrapment is a film that just doesn't care . it's a film about theft , all right . . . of your money , your time , and the devices of a dozen other trite hollywood star projects . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
director : peter ho-sun chan . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , sexual situations ) running time : 89 minutes . to your list of absolute cinematic oxymorons -- you know , like " pauly shore comedy " or " keanu reeves performance " -- please add the following : " bittersweet farce . " that's the disastrous combination served up by the love letter , a film that fairly screams for a more frivolous treatment . that might have been a clever , breezy entertainment , something considerably less labored than the mess delivered by screenwriter maria maggenti ( from cathleen schine's novel ) and director peter ho-sun chan . if maggenti and chan had offered some characters remotely resembling three-dimensional people , it might even have worked . the love letter makes no effort whatsoever to explain johnny's interest in helen , spends about thirty seconds establishing janet as little more than comic relief before creating a blink-and-you'll-miss-it sub-plot regarding her jealousy of helen , and wraps up with an out-of-left-field relationship between two characters about whom we know virtually nothing . even capshaw's helen , the film's center , is an enigma . for a film that apparently wants you to care who ends up with whom , the love letter gives you none of the tools to do so . it's a whodunnit with no clues . somehow , in the middle of this clumsy confection , one genuinely interesting character appears . as jennifer , another employee of helen's who dotes on unrequitedly on johnny , julianne nicholson is wonderfully sweet and achingly self-conscious . the troublie is , she's the only character in the film who belongs in such a story . everyone else plays the kind of functional , cardboard role you'd expect to find in . . . well , a farce about a love letter of unknown authorship changing hands indiscriminately . there's not a solid laugh to be found in this pretty to look at but ill-conceived romantic comedy , except at the idea that someone thought a bittersweet farce could work . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
director : josef rusnak . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 99 minutes . it would be easier -- and kinder -- to think of the thirteenth floor as a simple case of bad timing . that much head-tripping could be wearying under the best of circumstances , and the thirteenth floor is far from the best of circumstances . this is genre film-making at its most superficially plot-driven , compounding its shallow characterizations with a ridiculous degree of self-importance . there's nothing remarkably innovative about the film's premise at this point , but director/co-writer josef rusnak can't be faulted for bringing up the rear of the virtual reality parade . he can certainly be faulted , however , for the way he approached that premise . the thirteenth floor apparently wants hall's existential crisis to matter , yet the film never gives us enough background to understand hall , his friendship with fuller , or any of his anxieties . it often appears that key scenes of character development have been edited out and replaced by expository dialogue , leaving little but essential plot-advancing events and craig bierko's dead-eyed performance . that makes it virtually impossible for the story to develop any depth , or for hall's romance with a mysterious woman ( gretchen mol ) to be anything but functional . when the film's real " villain " shows up for the first time with about 15 minutes left , it's obvious that rusnak's primary goal is moving the story , character development be hanged . a science-fiction thriller can work , of course , without much profound commentary on the human condition ; heaven knows the matrix wasn't out to score philosophical brownie points . the matrix also didn't make the mistake of pretending to be anything more than it was , treating its subject matter with a playful , giddy energy . the thirteenth floor is one of those bleak , somber exercises in which the gloom is meant to suggest significance but instead makes it even more impossible to enjoy the story . on only one occasion , involving the confusion of fuller's simulation counterpart , does the thirteenth floor aspire to some kind of understanding . most of the time it's a plodding bore , grinding through the plot as though its themes were medicinally good for you instead of the stuff of paperback novels . i suppose it's praiseworthy that the thirteenth floor does work at providing clues for its plot twists instead of dropping them in your lap . mueller-stahl and d'onofrio are solid in their dual roles , almost making up for the blank attractiveness of mol and bierko . the film certainly achieves the atmosphere it's aiming for ; unfortunately , that atmosphere provides neither entertainment nor insight . even if you're prepared to overlook the inevitable head-scratching convolutions of plot , you're not likely to care about where they're taking you . i can imagine an alternate reality in which film-makers have figured out there's nothing more to say about alternate realities , at least for the time being . it must be a better place than this . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
this is my father is a family affair , and not just because its subject matter involves family ties . so warm and wonderful was the experience , evidently , that no one bothered to pay much attention to telling an interesting , coherent story . this is my father is a sprawling mess of a film that tries to tell several stories , each one more irritating than the last . the trouble begins in this is my father with a present-day prologue that does a miserable job of setting up the premise . in fact , the entire framing story feels like little more than a series of ridiculous contrivances . unfortunately , that romance is so ridiculously apocryphal that it's not clear until the last ten minutes which of two girls is supposed to be his own lovely lass . every moment set in the present is a wearying bore , leading this viewer to a stone-faced demand that the flashback sequences better be worth it . they're not . they're an improvement , to be certain , but there's so much extraneous business going on that the central romance gets lost . the romance itself ultimately makes no sense from fiona's side , with nary an attempt to explain why the spunky girl would be charmed by the socially inept kieran . aidan quinn fares better as a man-child unsure how to handle a romantic relationship , but the story places too much tragic weight on his shoulders . they may have been most interested in re-creating the sights and sounds of 1939 ireland . the problem is that you really can't tell what they wanted to do with any degree of certainty . this is my father never pulls its two storylines together in any believable way , nor manages to make either one gripping on its own terms . the filming may have served as a pleasant , roots-exploring quinn family vacation , but we the viewers are left with the tedium of watching their home movies . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : kevin brodie and robert singer , based on the story by ouida . director : kevin brodie . mpaa rating : pg ( adult themes , violence ) running time : 100 minutes . i note the following in the interest of fairness : a smattering of audience applause greeted the conclusion of a dog of flanders at the screening i attended . that audience consisted almost entirely of parents and pre-teens , causing me to ponder comments i've received over the years regarding whether " family films " should be held to a different critical standard . sure , a dog of flanders could appeal to children without very discriminating tastes ; yes , parents may be happy to find something warm 'n' fuzzy for the young'uns . i , however , watched as someone who expects little things like decent performances , a narrative with a point , and a script that doesn't feel like it was written _by_ children instead of _for_ children . a dog of flanders is simple , non-threatening , harmless family filmmaking that also happens to be thoroughly uninteresting on almost any level . but nello always perseveres , entering a youth art contest and maintaining a pure and honest heart . if you notice the conspicuous lack of any dog mentioned in that plot summary , there's a very good reason . despite the title , nello's pet bouvier des flanders , patrasche , plays only a token role in the film's events . that's not just unfortunate because it's somewhat deceptive -- it's unfortunate because the dog may turn in the film's best performance . the young performers , particularly newcomer farren monet , at least have inexperience as an excuse . voight and warden , who fuss and knit their brows and play with ever-varying accents , earn no such slack . a dog of flanders may be a youth melodrama , but there's not a moment of real character-based emotion to make the film tolerable as a narrative . it's hard to imagine how a production like this avoided the direct-to-video dustbin . it's also hard to imagine from this version that the story is such a classic that it has already been filmed three previous times . without a familiarity with either the source material or the earlier film incarnations , i can only assume that a story with such appeal had to focus on the adventures of a boy and his faithful dog . otherwise , a dog of flanders delivers the kind of timeless youth appeal one usually associates with an evening of cnn . those who enjoy the film will probably find ways in which those elements complement the story perfectly . for me , a dog of flanders lacked any of the elements which bring life to a family film -- emotional resonance , strong relationships , well-drawn characters . i'm not going to deny the appeal of a protagonist who perseveres and maintains a pure and honest heart , especially for parents looking to teach strength of character . it would have been nice , however , to build a watchable film around that strength of character . i'll leave this one to those parents and children who watch with a heroic generosity of spirit , those who won't leave thinking the real dog is the film itself . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
for nearly 15 minutes , chill factor actually warrants comparison to the film it tries so hard to bring to mind . for 15 minutes , it's almost speed with a thermometer instead of a spedometer . during that 15 minute chunk of the film , director hugh johnson does everything an action film director needs to do , offering plenty of close calls and nervous laughter . unfortunately , those 15 minutes occur smack in the middle of the film , between 45 minutes of excruciating introductory exposition and 45 minutes of alternatingly absurd and tedious conclusion . the burst of action seems like it's going to be the payoff for sitting through one of the longest , least interesting prologues to an action film _ever_ , a prologue which lays out brynner's feud with " elvis's " creator ( david paymer ) in exhaustive detail . then , almost before you get a chance to enjoy the few thrills chill factor can provide , it sends mason and arlo on a leisurely paddle down the river so they can bond over their past mistakes . and it's all downstream from there . it might have been at least remotely worth sitting through all that exposition if the characters or performances hadn't made you want everyone involved to end up chemically defoliated . cuba gooding jr . is rapidly turning into one of the most aggravating oscar-winning actors in history , a one-note performer who widens his eyes and tightens his jaw to express practically every emotion ( the direction of the corners of his mouth is the only hint as to his mood ) . his work in chill factor borders on the embarrassing , a frantic collection of over-the-top reactions that would make martin lawrence and chris tucker blush . skeet ulrich could only hope to register an emotion of any kind , using a flat delivery for even flatter lines . and colin firth squints and rasps his way through the villain role , never quite sure whether he should be a moustache-twirling melodrama baddie or tormented soldier with shattered patriotism . the absence of a sympathetic hero and solid villain damage an action film , but they're not always fatal . it can even get away with ridiculous plot developments , like the idea that a toxic chemical gas could be contained inside a traffic tunnel by blowing up both sides of the tunnel ( creating the ever-effective pile-of-rubble vacuum seal ) . but there is no way an action film can get away with so little action . chill factor just sits there , inert , for nearly its entire running time , even forgetting during its best moments to remind us of the status of its key plot element's rising temperature . it's hard to believe that a film this weightless would waste so much time on setting up the premise , then never exploit the premise . if you want to want to imagine chill factor -- and imagine why it's not even worth the time of a true-blue action fan -- think of speed , with 90 minutes of the film set at a bus stop . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : david e . kelley and sean o'byrne . producers : david e . kelley and howard baldwin . director : jay roach . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , adult themes , violence ) running time : 118 minutes . oh yes , and there's also a hockey game of some sort . with carter burwell's typically splendid score adding to the mystery of mystery , there's hope that kelley and director jay roach will combine an amusing little sociology lesson about small-town pride with the ever-appealing scrappy underdog story . they then proceed to heap so much extra baggage on the story that it never has a chance of getting off the ground . the rest of the half-dozen or so plot threads in mystery , alaska are just plain inexcusable . the first hour of the film is a grinding ordeal , so fragmented and unfocused that it's easy to forget what it's all supposed to be leading up to . in the final half-hour , when the film finally gets around to the hockey game , mystery , alaska generates at least a little energy . the rangers are a fairly anonymous opponent -- too much time is wasted on tangents to create a worthy adversary -- but roach directs the game scenes with plenty of verve . then even the game begins to over-stay its welcome , losing momentum by the minute . any potential for a rousing conclusion is lost in memories of the preceding two hours , with its two typically bombastic kelley courtroom scenes , tedious pacing and undisciplined script . mystery , alaska is a film that inspires slack-jawed frustration , leaving a viewer scrambling for a reason why this simple concept went so horribly wrong . the answer may be just as simple : perhaps kelley grew bored with something as mundane as a single film , and decided to turn it into a rambling two hour pilot for yet another television series . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
starring : max von sydow , ed harris , bonnie bedelia , j . t . walsh . director : fraser c . heston . if one adds sequels , original screenplays and television adaptations , that totals roughly 50 hours of film treatment , about two thirds of which has been useful only as a mild sedative . although to state that king's works have fared poorly in translation to the screen may be to give him more credit than he is due , it is certainly true that king on screen has been far less successful than king in print . that is not likely to change with needful things . lacking the suspense to be a crossover hit like misery , or sufficient mayhem to please the freddy krueger crowd , it treads a soggy middle ground , going for cheap laughs rather than working up solid scares . there is the germ of an intriguing idea in needful things , one borrowed from ray bradbury's something wicked this way comes : what would you be willing to do for your heart's desire ? add to that the simmering hatreds and intolerance beneath the veneer of polite interaction , and there's the potential for something beyond your run-of-the-mill gore fest . screenwriter w . d . richter and director fraser c . heston set up reasonably well , but don't deliver . needful things seems to take forever to get any kind of momentum going , and when it does at last seem to be moving it runs into a brick wall of silly dialogue and shoddy acting . the latter is somewhat surprising given the reasonably talented cast . valri bromfield sneers and swears as a loony turkey farmer ; amanda plummer does a new england accented variation on her standard eccentric ; j . t . walsh seems to be channeling jack nicholson's performance from the shining , but without the charisma , as the town's pompous leading citizen . the biggest shock is von sydow , who seems completely miscast . he appears to revel in the campier elements , never bringing any genuine menace to gaunt . i suppose the blame for that lies with richter , best know as the creator of the campy cult favorite the adventures of buckaroo banzai . he seems to have been a poor choice for this job , sacrificing suspense for silly punch lines . his black-humored approach to the story just didn't work . similarly , director heston ( yes , _that_ heston's son ) doesn't quite have the deft touch required to direct suspense . he does a nice job with the fantasy sequences as gaunt entices his customers , but other elements go completely astray . he never gives his actors a sense for the proper tone , which makes it appear that harris and bedelia are acting in a different movie than everyone else . and he lays on the atmospheric smoke in gaunt's shop so thick i thought i could see it puffing in from off-camera . needful things is muddled , and in too many of the wrong hands . i did find a few moments of amusement , all of which were probably unintentional . in one scene , a jukebox skips while playing " achy breaky heart , " repeating the title over and over . also ironic is harris' statement that " this is a quiet town . " given castle rock's history in the king canon , " quiet " is definitely not the adjective which springs to mind . i think a line by gaunt summarizes needful things better than i ever could : " a couple of deaths , a few explosions . . . not my best work , but what the hell . " 
director : gary sinyor . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 100 minutes . i came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor , an innocuous-enough-on-the-surface romantic comedy . it's not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity , but there it was nonetheless . i sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999 . in a word , it's the same thing that's wrong with so many movies circa 1999 : writing . more to the point , it's the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when you're telling a story about a relationship . the bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where we're expected to get dewy-eyed over any pairing of attractive , pleasant people just because they're attractive and pleasant . convinced despite his reservations that it's time to " sh * t or get off the pot , " jimmy proposes to anne -- very badly . it's a wacky , brewster's millions-esque premise ( acknowledged as such in one of the film's better , more self-aware lines of dialogue ) , the kind where a shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters . at least that would be the case if jimmy weren't already a world-class altruist . it's almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in the bachelor's plot development . by any human standard , the guy is impossibly selfless . and that's the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor -- the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness . there's never any tension between the two star-crossed lovers , because there's no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake . and forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation . the parade of sit-com set pieces had better be damned funny , since they're all that stands between us and a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion . i'll admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing , including ustinov's rantings about procreation and a restaurant full-to-bursting with men popping questions and champagne corks . far more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly , like the shudder-inducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortune-hunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in a church . you're never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film like the bachelor , but that's not the real problem . nor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warm-n-fuzzy conclusion it's leading up to . the problem are a beginning and middle that are equally warm-n-fuzzy -- there's no spark , no energy , no humanity . it's an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumer's digestions . we've reached a point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment don't even have a pulse . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : mark rosenthal and lawrence konner . director : barry sonnenfeld . michael j . fox is in a * deep * rut . it's a type that has worked for him , thanks to his charm and comic timing , but it puts him in danger of carrying questionable projects which seem comfortable . as a perfect example , witness for love or money , a cliche-filled would-be romantic comedy that's neither particularly romantic nor particularly funny . his specialty is doing that little something extra for the guests--walking their dogs , acquiring hard-to-get theater tickets--and raking in huge tips for his efforts . if you have to guess which choice doug will make , you haven't seen very many romantic comedies . the point is never whether they'll end up together , but simply how entertaining getting there will be . it starts promisingly enough , with a focus on doug's wheeling and dealing , but once the romantic plot kicks in there's just no energy . there's a lengthy sequence at a party involving mistaken identities and doug trying to hold everything together which was frantic but never really clicked ; after that , the film doesn't even seem to try . the situations are simply tedious . i can't begin to describe how tired i am of that stock " we both care about each other but neither one of us will admit it so instead we'll yell at each other " scene in romantic comedies . there are plenty of ways to establish conflict that actually occur in human life ( or perhaps i and everyone i know have just been lucky so far ) . for love or money uses up most of its best jokes and all of its originality in about ten minutes . i also had many problems with the performances . fox has spent so much time as the cocky young go-getter that he doesn't seem to know how to vary it . he also never conveys when the mild flirtation established early in their interaction becomes real romantic interest , but perhaps a better question than " when " is " why . " gabrielle anwar wanders through the film gorgeous but thoroughly uninteresting , emoting and pouting in ways that would make a high school drama teacher cringe . of the supporting players , only michael tucker as a nebbishy hotel guest is not a complete stereotype . particularly embarrassing are fascistic german hotel manager and a swishy fashion designer , but they are just the most glaring examples of a script that makes all the easy choices , and all the wrong ones . director barry sonnenfeld was a marvelous cinematographer ( miller's crossing ) , but so far only a barely serviceable director . like the addams family , for love or money is too ham-fisted , and sonnenfeld's few stylistic flourishes are lost in slow pacing and mishandled actors . 
starring : sylvester stallone , wesley snipes , sandra bullock . screenplay : daniel waters and robert reneau & peter m . lenkov . director : marco brambilla . it would seem sylvester stallone has learned a lesson : give the people what they want . sly wanted to expand into comedy , but he made bad choices and audiences stayed away in droves . or my mom will shoot , hello cliffhanger . now the second coming of sly the action hero brings us demolition man , and i expect it will do similarly big business , despite the fact that it's a bloated conglomeration of failed story elements and lead balloon punch lines . the main problem with demolition man is that i never bought its underlying premise for a moment . the screenplay makes virtually no effort to explain how the authorities of the 21st century were able to convince its mainstream populace to abandon sex , drinking , smoking and profanity . it's just a pax ex machina , and it doesn't work . if that were not enough , there is the further problem of a scattered storyline with too many plot threads . for an action film , demolition man never really gets up a head of steam , spending far too much screen time on superfluous subplots . the fact is , at times demoliton man seems more intent on being a satirical comedy than an adventure . many of the gags are based on the requisite anachronisms , most notable a running string of malapropped 20th century cliches by bullock which are true groaners . we also get references to rambo ( get it ? ) and the schwarzenegger presidential library which seem like they're expected to be funny just because they're mentioned . denis leary also gets a ranting bit straight out of his stand-up routine for no apparent reason other than to give him something to say . there are times when the loopy sense of humor works , such as the rather incongruous skill programmed into spartan . however , for every one clever bit there are five hammered into the ground like the gratingly repeated penalty buzzer every time a character swears . i actually began hoping for things to blow up ; at least that was done well . as for the acting , the less said the better . snipes has perverse fun with phoenix , but he's on screen far too little , and his character is reduced to cocky one-liners . stallone is more personable than he's been in years , but he too has no character to speak of . bullock does have a character , just no recognizable talent . rob schneider of " saturday night live " has a funny bit part , but that's about all for bright spots . demolition man is bound to appeal to some on a very basic level ; there are great pyrotechnics , and the production design is impressive . but i found it wanting even as macho entertainment . much of the action is uninspired , annoyingly photographed or badly edited , and even that action is too long in coming . demolition man is like that old joke about a bad restaurant : the food is awful . . . and such small portions . 
there was a point during mr . jones when it occurred to me that if it had been made in french , someone might have championed it as an understated bit of high culture . it's well-directed , generally well-acted , and includes several meaningful closeups and a few piano performances . it also features a story which goes absolutely nowhere . if any film this year can be said to demonstrate a visual monotone , it's mr . jones is given to grand theatrics , such as poising himself on the edge of a roof and claiming he's going to fly , or jumping onstage at a symphony to conduct the orchestra . a film like mr . jones has to walk its own very fine line , being careful not to romanticize mental illness . unfortunately , mr . is the idea that one can only truly live while on the manic side of manic depression ? both concepts are fairly distasteful , and it makes it awfully hard for the love story to generate any resonance . she is supposed to be the dynamic character in this piece , like tom cruise to dustin hoffman in rain man , but there's not a clear enough sense of where she's coming from to make where she's going compelling . mr . jones is just a case of a poorly developed basic premise . this basic premise is also undercut by a performance from richard gere which is excellent , but toned totally wrong for the film . it's a daring portrayal , never kooky just for the sake of being kooky ( like mary stuart masterson directing traffic with ping pong paddles in benny & joon ) , and willing to dig into the darker corners of this disturbed man's psyche . the problem is that gere is so good at conveying jones' dark side that dr . bowen's attraction just doesn't make any sense . these two people seem to have been thrown into bed together simply for the expendience of the story , and not because of any character motivation . jones is likely to lose most viewers , however , is a tone so muted that it's virtually inaudible . everything is slowly , painstakingly framed , even those moments which are supposed to represent mr . jones' mania . there is virtually no underscore , causing far too many scenes to come off cold and clinical . where some films beat you over the head with big emotions , mr . jones seems to dare you to find any emotional attachment . it doesn't help that some scenes are poorly lit , and that in others lena olin's dialogue is almost completely incomprehensible . i want to admire mr . jones for not leaning towards the sentimental , but it's no virtue to opt instead for comatose . mr . jones has been sitting on the shelf for a year or so , and it's easy to see why . it's a love story without much love , and a character study low on character . i was impressed by richard gere , but he alone isn't reason enough to spend two hours with mr . jones . . . now * that's * love . 
screenplay : john patrick shanley . directors : dick zondag & ralph zondag . if i didn't know how long animation takes to produce , i'd swear universal had thrown it together in a few months just for that purpose . we're back is sadly uninspired kiddie fare , perhaps moderately diverting for elementary schoolers but likely to be a tedious 70 minutes for their parents . from a story standpoint , we're back is a mess . it seems to have no idea what it wants to be--fast paced adventure , goofy comedy , dark mood piece--so it throws a little bit of everything into the stew in the hope that something will work . but the chase sequences are only interesting thanks to gut-churning computer effects , the comedy is limp and the scarier segments , which are the best , come far too late . there is even an attempt at a musical production number , a lively enough james horner-thomas dolby composition called " roll back the rock , " but it strains so hard to be charming that it's an effort to watch . the schizophrenic tone is not necessarily a problem for a 7-year-old attention span , but the lack of continuity gave me a headache . visually , the film fares only slightly better . the prehistoric setting is appropriately gloomy , but we only see it for about a minute . most of the film takes place in a new york colored in oranges and golds , and it's just not at all interesting to look at . professor screweyes' circus is dark and creepy , but it is a real missed opportunity . directors dick and ralph zondag could have gone for a real pinocchio-style funhouse of frights , but they just let the circus sit there full of unexplored potential . they manage to pull out one truly arresting image , involving a flock of crows , but the film is almost over by that time . nothing in we're back captures the eye or the imagination . perhaps the fatal flaw in we're back is a collection of characters which might almost scrape together a personality between them . disney built its empire on carefully created and memorably performed characters , but screenwriter john patrick shanley turns in as bland a bunch as i can imagine . john goodman does a half-hearted bing crosby impression as the affable rex , charles fleischer simply recycles roger rabbit as dweeb , and felicity kendal and rene levant are each thrown a token character trait as the other dinosaurs . walter cronkite and julia child seem to be present only for the novelty of doing trademark lines to animation , and jay leno is genuinely annoying as captain neweyes' alien sidekick . the kids are not bad , nicely performed by joey shea and " the simpsons' " yeardley smith , but the only real fun comes from martin short as a frustrated clown in the scary circus . his antics are as random as everything else , but at least they were funny . as if the slipshod disney knockoffs ( the contract signing from the little mermaid , zoom-ins on the wide-eyed heroine ) weren't bad enough , we're back gives in to insipid moralizing . uncle walt had more respect for kids than that . it's too bad when parents' only matinee options are as monotonous as we're back . or wait for the lion king . . . 
screenplay : james orr & jim cruickshank and judi ann mason . director : bill duke . let's play a little " jeopardy . " if you said the question was , " why make a sequel to sister act ? " you'd be right . it certainly wasn't because anyone had an actual idea or , if onscreen evidence serves , because whoopi goldberg was brimming over with enthusiasm to don the robes again . sister act was a simple but extremely pleasant entertainment which worked thanks to a solid set-up and lively performances . sister act 2 : back in the habit strips away the last shred of energy , originality and fun , leaving only a few good musical numbers and a stupefyingly uninteresting story . if the preceding summary betrays my antipathy , well , it was going to come out sooner or later . the irony of sister act 2 is that where so many recent sequels have done nothing by xerox the original , there was at least an attempt in this case to do something different . unfortunately , the attempt was dreadfully misguided . the charm of sister act was based on goldberg's fish out of water frustration and the interesting collection of characters in the convent . there was a plausible reason for her to be there , and a genuine conflict . in sister act 2 there's no conflict , no plausibility and nowhere for the humor to come from . screenwriters james orr , jim cruickshank and judi ann mason throw goldberg into one of the most overused situations in films , the underachieving bunch of kids who just need a tough-but-understanding teacher with a fresh perspective . even so , they at least could have played it for laughs , but there is nothing funny going on anywhere . a couple of the kids are flat out annoying , and the resolution of this story is telegraphed from the moment they appear . this is nothing but stand and deliver with a wimple . what's truly depressing is that none of the returning characters even needed to be here . kathy najimy , wendy makkena and mary wickes stay pretty much in the background , because their characters haven't been given anything to do . coburn is ostensibly the villain of the piece , but there is no effort to define his character or his motivations , so he just becomes a scowling oaf . anyone could have wandered into that classroom and it would have been the same movie . there's some small attempt to portray a balanced picture of inner city life , but basically it's disney 'n the hood . lauryn hill gives a nice performance as rita , and i did enjoy the music . but sister act 2 is supposed to be a comedy , and i did not laugh * once * . the question is , " how many sequels to sister act should have been made ? " 
that irritating sound you'll be hearing for the first 20 minutes of hanging up -- more or less non-stop-- is the ringing of phones . in the context of the film , you could say the ringing phones represent the distractions that keep us from focusing on what really matters . or maybe they stand for the way we can talk and talk and talk without ever really communicating . and in the context of the film , either message would be painfully ironic . hanging up is an extruciatingly awkward piece of film storytelling -- a movie full of distractions from what really matters , a movie that talks and talks and talks without ever really communicating . it's all about evie , and ryan does her perky , weepy best trying to make evie's plight matter . too bad hanging up is such a muddle of shifting tones and undeveloped relationships that ryan's manic performance reeks less of frustration over her life than desperation over the script . every scene feels aborted in mid-thought , leaving little but the spectre of matthau trying to give some hammy charm to a character that's alternately eccentric-annoying and creepy-annoying . by that time it's far too late to make that interaction convincing or endearing , since both keaton and kudrow are playing gross caricatures of self-absorption . it's inevitable , then , that every moment between the sisters feels false , every grating attempt at bickering , bittersweet reconciliation or playful kitchen food-fighting serving as a reminder that you were expecting a movie about the ties that bind . what you get instead is a movie about people who all signed up to be in the same movie . there are so many things wrong with hanging up -- the stilted script by delia and nora ephron , the wretched editing , matthau's depressing shtick -- that it seems absurd to pick out one moment of epic miscalculation . it's a pivotal moment , one that will explain any number of issues in evie's life . . . and it's dispatched in a matter of seconds , with leachman delivering about a half-dozen lines of dialogue . that sort of incomplete , abrupt storytelling defines hanging up , a film that becomes such a fragmented collection of life moments that it's virtually impossible for the whole thing not to give you a headache . that irritating sound you'll be hearing after the phones finally stop ringing in hanging up is the dissonant buzz of movie that never has a point . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : thomas ropelewski . director : john schlesinger . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity , brief nudity ) running time : 105 minutes . you can be sure that the next best thing will find plenty of viewers unsympathetic to its message in support of unconventional family structure -- the christian coalition , for example , or the utah state legislature . we may have come a long way , baby , in matters of social tolerance , but we haven't come _that_ far . still , you would expect the people involved in making the next best thing to have the passion to turn it into a compelling story . john schlesinger is one of the few openly gay directors making hollywood films . and madonna well , i saw truth or dare , so i get the impression she's fairly familiar with alternative lifestyles . what , then , is the excuse for the next best thing turning out so generally dreary and uninspired ? as with many films , so far so good in the general concept department . it's only in the execution that the next best thing becomes an ordeal to endure . the character of abbie is the heart of the disaster , and i'd be inclined to blame screenwriter thomas ropelewski ( more on his faults to come ) if not for the screen performance tragedy that is madonna . these days , it's impossible to notice anything but that deliberate , affected speech pattern of hers . abbie does some pretty unsympathetic things over the course of the film , so it's crucial that she be played with some energy and charm . it's a performance so leaden it drags every single thing about the next best thing down along with it . with such a horrendous casting mistake at the heart of the next best thing , sapping it of any possible resonance , it's easy to tune out and spend great heaping chunks of the film mulling over its other faults . like , did ropelewski think there was a rule that any film featuring a gay character must have an aids-related sub-plot , no matter how irrelevant to the rest of the story ( hint : it could have been more relevant had there been an attempt to connect the question of surviving partners' rights to gay parents' rights ) ? why did usually reliable cinematographer elliot davis light the whole film as though we were in a cave , except for the morticia adams memorial eye , nose & throat spotlight used on madonna ? and what was with schlesinger's frequent use of fish-eye point-of-view perspectives that merely served to make a serio-comic tale occasionally border on the grotesque ? it's obvious that the next best thing wants to make a statement about inequities in the adjudication of custody matters , and question what it is that makes a parent . the statement and question are both valid , but that's all there is to this clumsy concoction . rupert everett is solid both comedically and dramatically , providing virtually all of the film's worthwhile moments , but he's the only thing about the next best thing that doesn't inspire far more head shaking than righteous indignation . sure , everyone involved was probably telling a story about which they felt deeply , and their hearts were certainly in the right place . when you're making a film , however , heart just isn't always enough . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
i enjoyed its silly humor , but if the microscopic ratings were any indication , the audience for elliott's fey goofball character was severely limited . it's therefore hard to figure why a studio would green-light a project like cabin boy , particularly assuming anyone actually saw a script before shooting started . cabin boy is dumb even by the standards of a chris elliott project , depending almost entirely on elliott's dopey grin and taking far too long to get to anything with any real wit . this includes a prologue at the prep school which seems to last about twice as long as the ten minutes it actually is . elliott adopts a supremely annoying quasi-brahmin accent that makes most of his dialogue grating , and makes about twelve jokes too many based on nathanial's condescension toward common folk . then we get a bizarre cameo by david letterman , which is almost funny simply for its bald refusal to disguise his regular tv personality . in a film which runs under eighty minutes , a tedious set-up is more than a hindrance . . . it's a pre-emptive first strike . once cabin boy hits open water ( or at least as open as it gets on the sound stage ) , it's no longer actively annoying . it's also not much more funny . elliott's schtick always tends to the surreal , but as weird as things get , they remain curiously uninteresting . if any of that sounds funny on paper , well , it did to me , too . it's the execution that fails . while the bargain basement production values might be endearing to some , i found the visual gags in cabin boy painfully unfunny . some of the verbal bits work , but in their rarity i hesitate to spoil them . i think one of the main reasons cabin boy comes up short is that it is so obviously a chris elliott vanity project . the four fishermen are virtually interchangeable characters ; not one of them is given a distinct comic personality out of which some humor could arise . there is a glimpse of what could have been in the character of the impossibly dense first cabin boy , who has a few brief scenes worth a chuckle or two , but he soon disappears . almost every punch line is elliott's , and a little of him can go a very long way . his comic vision is certainly unique , and viewers perfectly attuned to a mind that concocts a giant talking cupcake that spits tobacco might have much more fun with cabin boy than i had . however , i suspect a larger percentage will find it slow going , and exceedingly short on solid laughs . like caviar , chris elliott is an acquired taste . also like caviar , he should probably only be digested in very small portions . cabin boy was just too much for me to swallow . 
starring : richard gere , sharon stone , lolita davidovich . screenplay : david rayfiel & marshall brickman . director : mark rydell . exactly when it happened , i can't put my finger on . for about half an hour of intersection , i was intrigued , and wondered whether i was on to my first guilty pleasure of 1994 . then , at some point , i began to realize that intersection was taking itself far too seriously . while the film is cleverly structured and reasonably well-acted , it began to irritate me that it was trying to turn a mid-life crisis into a great existential drama . worse yet , it presented me with a " hero " i couldn't stand and an ending that left me angry . as i noted , intersection's early scenes boast enough slickness and craft to lend the illusion of consequence . the lead performances by gere , stone and davidovich are all understated , and davidovich in particular generates quite a bit of audience sympathy . efficient editing by mark warner and glossy photography by the talented vilmos zsigmond create a dreamy atmosphere , and james newton howard's jazzy score plays up the romance angle . the dialogue in the script by david rayfiel and marshall brickman is snappy , keeping conversations lively enough to maintain interest . it isn't all that long , however , before it becomes evident that there isn't all that much going on beneath intersection's shiny surface . the performers are " understated " primarily because there is so little substance to any of the characters . olivia is perky and sweet , but it's never particularly clear why she's so into vincent . sally , in the flashback sequences , is made to appear icy and reserved , and one of those scenes is quite clever . still , nothing in her character seems to justify vincent's behavior , and this may be intersection's critical failing . if it seems like i was expecting a morality tale . . . well , by the time it was over , i was . but even those who allow vincent more leeway than i did are likely to be turned off by mark rydell's heavy handed direction . gere's angst ridden face is frequently in close-up , usually while driving ; he probably ends up playing as many scenes with a steering wheel as he does with another actor . an antique clock becomes a distracting symbol , and the omnipresent northwest rain an objective correlative i could have done without . frequent flashbacks and dream sequences make for a dizzying narrative . so many stylistic choices in intersection turned me off that i'm tempted not to mention the off-handed allusion to the fact that vincent's 13-year-old daughter has an eating disorder . eh , why nitpick ? name it and it probably turned me off . 
screenplay : james toback . director : james toback . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , nudity , drug use , violence , adult themes ) running time : 100 minutes . the title of james toback's black and white carries several meanings . it also refers to the dichotomies present in most of the main characters -- between what they have been and what they want to be , between what others expect of them and what they expect of themselves . and , sadly , it also refers to writer/director toback's presentation of his story . there's nary a scrap of subtext to be found in his painfully shallow piece of exploration into a complex cultural phenomenon . black and white winds its way through the intertwined stories of several new yorkers over the space of a few days . there are plenty of characters for toback to keep track of in black and white , but apparently that's not a matter of great concern to him . and it's not surprising , since he hasn't got the slightest interest in developing any of those characters . toback throws out plenty of scenes in which we are supposed to understand what a problem it is when people pretend to be something they're not . the actual people , however , are absurdly static ; there may be one moment in the entire film when we glimpse an emotion that's recognizably human . the stunt casting certainly doesn't help , as houston , power and raekwon do little more than recite lines competently ( mike tyson does do a surprisingly effective job of playing himself , unconcerned about allaying fears that he's a psycho ) . with the notable exception of stiller -- who brings some pitiable self-absorption to his role -- the entire cast of black and white is used by toback as meat puppets to deliver his thoughts on race relations and sexual politics . he might as well have rented a billboard . as cinematic anthropology lessons go , black and white is about as clumsy and uninvolving as you could imagine . every theme is laid out in expository dialogue , crushing the attempt to give the film an improvised urgency . in the first 15 minutes , toback has told you absolutely everything he has to say . if you suspect that might turn the remaining 85 minutes into a pretentious bore , you're right . toback certainly doesn't , or he would have devoted as much energy to giving his characters personalities as he does to giving them speeches and a crossover-ready soundtrack for their lives . by the time black and white's " six months later " coda rolls around -- so abruptly you may be left disoriented by the shift -- you wonder why toback bothers to tie up loose ends at all . his notion of keeping it real means keeping it tedious and pedantic . everything he has to say is up there on the screen in black and white , often underlined just for good measure . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : gregory poirier and theresa rebeck . director : davis guggenheim . mpaa rating : r ( adult themes , sexual situations , profanity , violence ) running time : 90 minutes . hey , did you hear about the film that took on the subject of our collective fascination with gossip and innuendo ? it takes a serious look about how any story , told enough times , takes on the ring of truth , even if we have no concrete sense of where the story came from . it challenges us to be more skeptical of the tabloid-ization of our culture , our readiness to pass judgment on situations about which we know little and our obsession with the lurid over the substantive . it uses nuanced performances and taut plotting to give us a chilling glimpse into the way we contribute to warped perceptions and damaged lives every time we pay attention to the rumor mill . well , that's the story warner bros . would like to see disseminated , anyway . and like most buzz , there's a germ of truth to it surrounded by a whole lot of nonsense . gossip is actually a tawdry youth soap opera full of attractive people doing awful things -- cruel intentions gone to college . ah , what a deliciously scandalous and utterly exploitative premise . it's bad enough that gossip feigns ambiguity just long enough to set up obvious hedonistic villainy . it's even worse that the entire atmosphere of the film proves the filmmakers don't take any of its serious issues seriously . it might be interesting to explore the destructive power of rumor in a setting where you felt there was something at stake . gossip , on the other hand , is instantly disposable foolishness more interested in being sexy than being substantive . a film like this trying to make a case against people succumbing to their basest fascination with sordid stories -- it almost makes you want to laugh in the faces of those responsible . but there are so many more reasons to laugh at gossip besides its philosophical ineptitude . then there are the more sublime bits of silliness , like the obligatory torrential downpour for the finale , or the stunning lack of characterization offered to anyone in the film . and the less said about the dialogue , the better . some critics of gossip will probably fixate on its final , convoluted plot twist as the film's most ridiculous element , but i'd be inclined to disagree . buying the ending simply involves believing that one of the film's characters is not just too stupid to be in college , but too stupid to be allowed to live . considering the rest of the stupidity involved in gossip , that's not a tremendous stretch . i'd like to think that an intelligent film could have been made about the scorched earth effects of our indiscriminate telling of tales . gossip , a film targeted at teenagers , had a chance to be that film . and if you believe that one , i've got another tall tale for you . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : ron shelton . there may be only one thing in this world that i know better than movies , and that would be college basketball . for every two hours that i spend in a theater , i probably spend four in a gym or watching hoops on television . i spent a lot of time in blue chips picking on the details , but that wasn't only because i felt i knew the details ; it was also because there isn't all that much detail to be found . blue chips is a morality play drawn in big broad strokes , with a message that can be summarized in two words : " cheating * bad * . " " can you believe this ? " he seems to be saying . " it's not just a game any more ! " the film revels in self-congratulatory outrage , leaving its characters to founder undeveloped . j . t . walsh plays happy , the fat-cat athletic booster , as an absurd stereotype , and mary mcdonnell plays bell's ex-wife as a recycled version of her spirited ex from sneakers . there is the potential for an interesting conflict when o'neal's bodeaux exhibits a reluctance to buy in to the same ethic as his teammates , but shelton and director william friedkin seem reluctant to give any of the novice actor-athletes too much to say . they also seem unwilling to ask any of the hard questions about collegiate athletes , such as whether or not they actually deserve some sort of compensation . every choice is the obvious one and the wrong one , right down to an awful " conscience " voiceover during the climactic game . blue chips could have saved itself by getting its basketball right , but there are a basket full of problems there as well . the on-court action is fairly bland , and photographed from all the wrong angles . friedkin makes no particular effort to make the setting seem collegiate , with crowd shots focusing on politely cheering alumni . however , two gaffes particularly irked me . in the first game , with the margin twenty points in the last minute , every seat in the stand was still filled ; i suppose it would have been tricky telling half the crowd to leave when rumor has it that tickets for the filming were being scalped for $100 . then , in the final game , the crowd reaction comes far too slowly given the result , and doesn't seem remotely authentic . it's too bad shelton couldn't have brought the same feel to the hardwood that he brought to bull durham's dugout . there are a few things to like about blue chips . nolte is perfectly cast as a coach , and o'neal and hardaway are pleasant surprises . blue chips' puffed-up indignance wears thin quickly . 
screenplay : david zucker , pat proft and robert locash . i'd like to say a word at this time about the proliferation of genre parody/spoofs in the last year : stop . in twelve months we've seen at least half a dozen such films ( loaded weapon 1 , fatal instinct , robin hood : men in tights , etc . ) , with roughly that many laughs between them . last year's hot shots ! part deux was a tolerable but limp effort ; still , it shines next to naked gun 33-1/3 . the third installment in the series is only sporadically amusing , and often crosses the pop culture cannibalism scale from parody into self-parody . the first ten minutes of naked gun 33-1/3 offers some promise . the opening sequence targets the train station steps sequence from the untouchables , and it features some solid belly laughs thanks to a careful setup . there are also a couple of winning moments in the traditional opening credits featuring a roof's-eye view from a moving police car , particularly a nod to the death star trench run from star wars . unfortunately , that's where naked gun 33-1/3 hits the runout groove . in a zaz film , whether or not it works ultimately comes down to how many of the gags work , and there are painfully few good gags here . part of the problem can be attributed to director peter segal . much of the enjoyment from earlier zaz efforts came from watching the backgrounds , picking up jokes on the fringes of the frame . you fill in the gag ) . while none of their films were afraid to go for groaners , the difference is that they didn't underline them . many of the films naked gun 33-1/3 chooses to parody seem ripe for the picking , but the execution stumbles . jane's departure with friend louise in a green oldsmobile convertible seems to offer a great deal of promise , but the expected thelma & lousie parody offers surprising little payoff . time after time it looks like something worthwhile is coming along , and time after time the jokes just fall flat . there is one other crucial factor worth noting in naked gun 33-1/3 , and that is the performance of leslie nielsen . similarly , fred ward brings none of the qualities ricardo montalban and robert goulet brought to the first two films . rather than playing against the laughs , all the performers seem to be playing with them , and much of the goofiness is lost . it's too bad . i was hoping we could avoid naked gun . 44 : magnum farce . 
screenplay : darryl quarles and don rhymer . director : raja gosnell . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 99 minutes . the plot of big momma's house is martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress . that's not just the high-concept premise ; it's the fully-realized , all-encompassing plot . such an emphasis is not unheard-of in the world of hollywood summer entertainment . one need merely look back to last summer , when the plot of big daddy was adam sandler being an incompetent surrogate parent . the trap inherent in such an approach is that the high-concept plot idea better be pretty well-realized , or rest on the shoulders of an extremely talented performer , because you can bet there will be nothing else worth a second of your time -- not a developed character , not a provocative theme , not a witty twist . you will get 90-plus minutes of martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress -- nothing more , nothing less . those who find martin lawrence more than an occasionally amusing screen presence may have a shot at enjoying the one-note dud that is big momma's house . others will simply stare , mouth agape , at its sheer unapologetic laziness . that leaves master of disguise malcolm to go under very heavy cover as big momma and find out what sherry knows . big momma's house's bloodlines are certainly traceable to mrs . doubtfire -- director raja gosnell edited that film , and the makeup effects were similarly created by greg cannom -- but there's just as strong a whiff of tootsie in the main character's attempt to use his alternate identity to get closer to a woman . unfortunately , big momma's house makes a ridiculous decision neither of those other films made : instead of having the protagonist pose as a completely manufactured character unfamiliar to anyone elses , it places malcolm in the position of playing a friend and family member to several other characters . suspension of disbelief in big momma's house requires you to believe every other person in the film is blind and/or stupid , since no one notices that one big momma looks or sounds absolutely nothing like the other . of course , laughs trumps logic every time , and big momma's house probably still would have worked in spite of its utter disdain for common sense if it had just managed to be funny . martin lawrence can be likeable enough at times , but there's no reason to care a whit about his budding romance with sherry because malcolm is never an independently significant character . he's just big momma without the makeup on . i won't waste time commenting on how ineptly the set-up of the escaped convict is employed , since it was clearly a waste of time to the film-makers . there are a few token scenes of lester looming as a threatening figure , but he's ultimately a distraction in a film that's really about its central visual incongruity ( and the accompanying lascivious glances at nia long's posterior ) . i'm never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people -- several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing -- but i know that when a film-maker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that it's an entire film , i duck out of the way . the gross implausibility of big momma's house might have been tolerable if it was seasoned with more big , cleverly-constructed laughs . its lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant . big momma's house is ridiculous _and_ not funny . it's just a sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay/director : bille august . and that just about covers most of what is wrong with this adaptation of isabel allende's novel . there are plenty of other things wrong--inappropriate tone , dreadful miscasting , laughable acting--but the fundamental failing of the house of the spirits is a screenplay which races from scenario to scenario without any apparent concern for the establishment of character . when this two hour-plus " epic " concluded , i felt nothing for the characters and embarrassment for the cast . it is difficult to comprehend how bille august thought he could accomplish everything it seems he wanted to accomplish in only 140 minutes . in fact , after only twenty minutes i could tell that the house of the spirits should have been a miniseries , and should have been directed by someone else . there is no texture , no depth and no life to any of these characters ; august directs as though he is interested only in getting in , doing a scene , and getting out . but close has just a few minutes of screen time before this scene , giving ferula no chance to develop that history . everything is too densely compressed and without resonance , and the house of the spirits blasts through six decades without leaving any emotion in its wake . with such a basic flaw at the core of the film , all other criticism seems like nit-picking . however , it is difficult not to note that the house of the spirits could have been much better with a cast that seemed at all comfortable in these roles . the primary culprit is jeremy irons , whose performance here is , quite simply , appalling . esteban is the pivotal character in this story , but irons gives no subtlety to his systematic alienation of his family . in his defense , he does have to deliver his lines through an obviously annoying set of false teeth , but he still mugs his way shamelessly through scenes which required an understanding of traditional latino conceptions of masculinity which he clearly did not have . winona ryder continues to act out of her depth , although she has some good scenes in the final half hour when the political drama takes center stage . close has a thankless , twitchy role , and streep merely looks radiant without having any real presence . only banderas and joaquin martinez , as esteban's bastard son , show any spark . how curious . . . that two hispanic actors should seem to grasp this material . it sort of makes you wonder what might have been . miramax must have looked at the pedigree on this film and thought it had a purebred winner on its hands . i hope someday someone films the house of the spirits as a miniseries . the material deserves a second chance . 
there's something terribly depressing about a wonderful concept turned into mush by someone who doesn't know how to handle it . the irritations of a film like the replacements are far more mundane by comparison-you know that it will be at best a tolerable audience-friendly mediocrity , at worst a bland , pressed and processed entertainment mcnugget . but i'm a cheerleader , on the other hand , could have been a brilliant bit of satire . it could have been the kind of film that , even while preaching to the choir , highlights the magnificent absurdities of a very hot-button issue . could've been , but isn't . there's something in that idea to anger virtually anyone , only babbit doesn't pursue it . even the good gags babbit wrings from this variation -- like the photo in megan's school locker -- are underlined too obviously , and never reach into truly daring areas . the campy tone set in the first half-hour , including moriarty's drag diva performance , show that babbit isn't particularly interested in scathing humor . simple mockery suits her just fine . even that tone , however , proves to be one she can't sustain . but i'm a cheerleader might never have been riotously funny as the silly spoof it initially appears to be , but at least it might have felt consistent . babbit makes the ridiculous decision to bounce back and forth between scoring points off swishy stereotypes , exploring the conflicts of family reaction to homosexuality and developing an actual romantic sub-plot . there's not nearly enough substance to but i'm a cheerleader for its serious side to feel anything but token , and too many misguided serious moments to give it a real comic kick . and you can feel that potential being crushed under babbit's leaden heel every time megan and graham share a tender moment . there are plenty of people who take the idea of converting gays and lesbians to heterosexuality very seriously , and plenty of people with same-sex attractions who desperately want such programs to work . babbit never seems to clue into that fact , or she would base her satire more squarely in the growing popularity of these programs . instead , she lays out but i'm a cheerleader as though the whole idea were self-evidently ludicrous , and gets lazy about finding the humor in people scrambling for conformity , acceptance and easy answers to a challenging issue . but i'm a cheerleader simply isn't funny enough often enough , and that's the kiss of death for a low-budget comedy full of broad performances and careless story-telling ( what happened to the foreshadowing involving another girl's apparent jealousy of megan and graham's relationship ? ) . there's no excuse for a subject this incendiary to be the stuff of pratfalls and sappy endings . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : steven e . de souza . director : john landis . on the one hand , it doesn't seem like that long since i saw it in a theater for the first time . on the other hand , it seems like twice that long since murphy has had a hit . it certainly must seem like an eternity to murphy ; he is proved consistently unable in the last few years to recapture the cop audience without returning to beverly hills . and what a lifeless outing it is--slow , unfunny and lacking even murphy's cocky charm . give steven e . de souza credit for not deciding simply to rehash beverly hills cop . cop iii is more of a pure action film , which makes it exactly the wrong kind of film for john landis to direct . landis' sense of pacing has always been suspect to say the least , tending towards manic spurts interrupted by long , surrealistic comic passages , and that package is on display here . for no apparent reason , landis interrupts his establishing sequence in the chop shop to bring us a production number featuring two corpulent gentlemen performing " come see about me . " bronson pinchot's scene-stealing serge from cop i returns as a personal security-device peddler in a scene which takes far too long to introduce a single plot element . ditto for the scene in which we sit through an entire park attraction , because we know it's going to show up later . there is no economy to the screenwriting or the direction , and landis has simply gotten too predictable in his shot selection . in one scene in a restaurant bar , i anticipated the conclusion of the scene two minutes before it happened . it's also extremely unfortunate that in addition to abandoning the cop i formula , de souza has also decided to abandon the characters . perhaps to set up an action sequence . murphy gets to fire a lot of bullets , but gets painfully few opportunities to show that axel's greatest weapon is his wits . of course , it would have been difficult for any wit to come through when murphy sleepwalks through his performance . perhaps he senses what the audience does , that a thirty-something axel foley isn't nearly as interesting as a twenty-something axel foley . there is some good action to be found in beverly hills cop iii , particularly a rescue on a runaway park ride , and one very funny sequence involving a multi-faceted gun . but there is none of the irreverent edge that made the young murphy so appealing . maybe that's what depressed me most about cop iii : considering the possibility that we might never see that eddie murphy again . 
screenplay : john byrum . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , brief nudity , adult themes , drug use , violence ) running time : 113 minutes . in the opening scene of duets , director bruce paltrow establishes with little room for doubt that we have fled reality for its hideous cinematic doppleganger . of course the bet proves to be a hustle , but the problem is the casting . not for the voice of god , but for the competent , breathy chops of huey lewis . this isn't the eddie felson of the karaoke set we're talking about ; it's not even the eddie money of the karaoke set . it's huey . freaking . lewis . for the next 108 minutes or so , duets leaps from that implausible scenario to scenarios even less plausible , turning it into a character study in which inhabitants of the planet earth are nowhere to be found . essentially it's a road picture , switching back and forth between three less-than-dynamic duos converging on a big karaoke contest in omaha . duets is one of those " when bad movies happen to good actors " experiences that makes you wonder whether anyone involved actually read the script before committing . it's particularly sad watching giamatti and braugher do the buddy bonding thing with such shallow characters . giamatti makes for such a wonderfully manic schlub that he's entertaining to watch in spite of the material ; braugher has presence , but he can't bring any depth to a character that's ultimately supposed to be tragic . paltrow does a nice ditzy bit , but that's the one note her character is allowed . in fact , that's true of every character in the film . bello , speedman , lewis and company are all playing characters with one note , one epiphany and one grinning resolution . these aren't performances ; they're cries for help . paltrow the elder offers none , and goes one better by actually making matters worse . a talented television director with little feature film experience , paltrow puts his film together in such a disjointed manner that even well-constructed characters would have been hard-pressed to emerge intact . close-ups become medium shots for a couple of seconds for no apparent reason before returning to close-ups ; ostensibly comic scenes linger and dawdle with no punch . paltrow does have the paternal generosity and good sense to let the gifted cinematographer paul sarossy shoot gwyneth lovingly . there's no pacing , no momentum and no point . there is , however , plenty of karaoke . duets seems constructed with the desperate hope that viewers will be entertained enough by the musical numbers -- lifted heavily from the pop music glory years of the late '70s and early '80s -- that they'll ignore the complete absence of personality in anyone singing them . unfortunately , that's fairly typical of the skewed world served up in duets . if you loved huey as the pride of every karaoke joint , you'll love the police leaving an armed man alone for a final tender moment . in this paper-thin road film , reality is the road not taken . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
starring : danny devito , gregory hines , kadeem hardison , mark wahlberg , stacey dash , khalil kain , lillo brancato , james remar . screenplay : jim burnstein . director : penny marshall . it was inevitable that renaissance man would be compared to dead poets society . the 1988 robin williams vehicle was a critical and commercial success , and the comparison makes for ready-made epithets ( dead poets platoon , " oh drill sergeant my drill sergeant " ) . but the comparison is really rather specious ; once you get beyond the classroom setting , there really isn't all that much substance or tone in common between the two . it's much more useful to think of renaissance man as sister act 2 on an army base--as well as much more depressing . constructed around pre-fabricated emotion and a premise that's sporting liver spots , renaissance man is only slightly more entertaining than last year's whoopi goldberg debacle , and twenty minutes too long besides . it's indicative of how sloppy the writing is that jim burnstein anticipates the film's key credibility question--why doesn't the army just kick the double d's out--without bothering to answer it . maybe the base commander ( nicely played by cliff robertson ) could have confessed that he was once like those troubled kids , or something of the sort . but burnstein offers little more than a shrug of the shoulders . " i've given you the movie , " he seems to be saying ; " you fill in the motivation . " and so it goes in a script that's like a chinese combination platter : one from column a , one from column b . only without any of the flavor . that goes for a meticulously integrated collection of double d's , craftily acted to a one but established from their sledge-hammer opening confessionals in the broadest possible terms . the sweathogs were given more depth . with his ewok hugability , devito can't pull off the hard-edged rago of the film's early scenes . nuances of character aside , renaissance man is simply an unfunny , earthbound comedy . there are at least three too many double d's , each requiring a personal epiphany of varying magnitude , and penny marshall has to spread the film far too thin to accomodate them . there is no spark , no energy , no anything to renaissance man's laboriously staged set pieces but musical crying cues . marshall's old-fashioned brand of sentimentality doesn't play without characters the audience cares about , and renaissance man chugs to its conclusion without an ounce of genuine humanity . renaissance man is the kind of film that wears its emotion in such lines as " victory starts here " ( accompanied by an emphatic gesture to the head ) , and exchanges between rago and his daughter like : " do you want your pennant ? " " no , i just want you to believe in me . " usually i respond to such films in spite of myself , but not this time . renaissance man is a glossy mess that , like its young protagonists , just can't shoot straight . 
screenplay : dick beebe and joe berlinger . director : joe berlinger . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , adult themes , nudity , sexual situations , drug use ) running time : 89 minutes . in coming up with a concept for a sequel to the blair witch project -- as apparently sequel-proof a film as ever was made -- the producers actually had a brilliant idea . in the summer of 1999 , the blair witch project wasn't so much an innovative , polarizing suspense film as it was a cultural phenomenon . so instead of devising a sequel to the blair witch project , haxan films devised a sequel to the cultural phenomenon . for about five minutes , that concept is executed to perfection . it's clever stuff , but it's soon discarded for a " dramatization " of a story about one particular group of tourists . there was no way that blair witch 2 could capture the intensity of the original , though it tries to cling to some of the details ( like naming all the characters after the actors playing them ) . it's ultimately a pretty conventional horror film , but the reason it fails is not that it's conventional . it's simply wretchedly executed even as a conventional horror film . berlinger and company never rustle up a single decent scare during the film's hour and a half running time , opting instead for lurid quick-cuts to brutal murders . even the basic structure of the film undercuts any chance for suspense . at various points in the main story , berlinger splices in police interviews with characters in the film , interviews clearly intended as flash-forwards to a point after the main story has ended . how stupid is it to telegraph exactly who will live and who will die in a conventional horror film ? the truly depressing thing about blair witch 2 is that it discards such a potentially intriguing framework for its story . there's an amusing moment early in the film where a competing tour group crosses paths with our protagonists , suggesting that the film will continue to draw on the original film's appeal as a central element to the story . but ultimately the idea of a constructed mythology and its effect on psychology gives way to obvious apparitions and overly literal supernatural phenomenon . then the film can't even manage to render those obvious apparitions in a creepy way , devoting most of the film to tedious scenes of characters watching videotape or shrieking accusations at one another . plenty of blair witch project detractors counted the incessant arguing and shouting among their gripes . now imagine all that arguing and shouting by actors reading awful dialogue instead of improvising their anxiety , and you get a sense for how irritating blair witch 2 turns out to be . if nothing else made the majority of blair witch 2 a painful experience , there would be the inexplicably bizarre performance by lanny flaherty as a surly sheriff . flaherty acts as though his only frame of reference for cinematic lawmen was jackie gleason in the smokey and the bandit films , inspiring fits of unintentional laughter every time he appears or utters a thickly-drawled threat . it's hard to build an atmosphere of impending doom when one of the actors appears convinced that the film is a broad comedy . there are welcome elements of self-parody in blair witch 2 , but berlinger doesn't know when to turn off the gags and make a real scary movie . the makers of blair witch 2 were smart enough to realize that they couldn't catch the same lighting in a bottle again . they just weren't talented enough to catch a different kind of lightning . blair witch 2 proves to be nothing but a big empty bottle . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : david koepp . director : russell mulcahy . batman , of course , set the course with its gothic gotham and tortured dark knight , and later films such as the crow have attempted to capture the same moody atmosphere . well , not much of a challenger , actually . the shadow is the kind of film that makes others in the genre look better by comparison . warts and all , batman and the crow were at least consistent in their tone ; the shadow is messy , convoluted and plodding , the work of a director without an ounce of vision . director russell mulcahy's last film was the execrable kim basinger exercise the real mccoy , and if the shadow proves anything it is that mulcahy hasn't learned much about pacing since then . for an adventure film , the shadow moves like a truck through mud . there is promise through the film's opening fifteen minutes , as mulcahy takes advantage of some nifty special effects to make the shadow's first showdown with bad guys brisk and effective . then , just as quickly , the shadow slams into a wall ( or maybe one of the many laughably bad matte paintings which fill the film ) . there is no tension or excitement to any of the shadow's confrontations with shiwan khan or his henchmen , and the dialogue is lacking in any real wit . when we see that screenwriter david koepp ( jurassic park ) has set the climactic scene between the shadow and khan in a hall of mirrors , we see how truly lacking in creativity was any aspect of the shadow's production . it also appears that koepp and mulcahy couldn't agree as to whether they were making a dark tone-y picture a la batman or a more traditional comic book adventure closer to the rocketeer . like batman , the shadow is a character with a dark side , and koepp seems to want to keep that dark side in focus . but then , just when the tone seems clear , mulcahy will whip out an egregious crane shot or , in one of the most pointless exercises in whiz-bang photography in recent memory , follow a message through miles of pneumatic tubing . perhaps one of the reasons the shadow feels so stagnant is that writer and director are pulling so hard from opposite ends that it ends up going nowhere . that confusion wastes the fine casting of alec baldwin in the title role . unfortunately , he gets virtually no supporting help . john lone is much too low-key as khan , and doesn't seem to realize what a villain has to be in a film like the shadow , namely charismatic . penelope ann miller is once again nothing but eye candy , perhaps the only actress on the planet who makes kim basinger look talented . when it comes right down to it , very little in the shadow works , because no one involved seemed to have anything interesting to say or present visually . here's hoping that universal's marketing department doesn't have the power to cloud too many minds into spending money on this one .

" however , one wonders whether anyone involved in it could happen to you ever saw a frank capra film . the capra heroes played by james stewart , gary cooper and others were not spotless , just basically good folks struggling to do the right thing . i almost wondered whether the nice guy character was being mocked . bridget fonda is nearly as angelic , though she is given a tough background to overcome and an endearing fatalism . fonda and cage are two likable actors , but ultimately there is not a drop of tension in their relationship . that's a real disappointment , because i expect better from andrew bergman . he has written or co-written some of the funniest and quirkiest screenplays of the last twenty years , including blazing saddles , the in-laws and the freshman , and directed last year's enjoyable honeymoon in vegas . both of them should know better . comedy requires some kind of edge to get it rolling , whether it's situation or character , and it could happen to you has neither . at its best , it produces a few smiles . at its worst , rosie perez is on screen . as the " villain " of the film , perez plays muriel as an unrepentant shrew-from-hell , and it's the kind of part where she's in the most trouble . her voice , somewhat grating in its most tolerable moments , skyrockets into dog whistle range when she browbeats cage . it is a performance so annoying that even had it could happen to you been satisfying on all other counts , she might have spoiled the experience singlehandedly . there's nothing wrong with fairy tale love stories ; beauty and the beast was one of the most romantic film experiences of the decade so far . but those animated characters were more real than anyone in it could happen to you . 
screenplay : david veloz , richard rutowski and oliver stone . director : oliver stone . few filmmakers in the last twenty years have so consistently had so little to say as loudly as oliver stone . by pairing up his single-note self-righteousness with cinematic histrionics , stone has managed to create a controversial body of work which dazzles with its visual inventiveness even as it clubs you insensible with its strident moralizing . natural born killers is the natural culmination of this style/message schism , a gutsy and gaudy assault on the senses that forgets to bring along a single original or insightful thought . even the dynamic performances of woody harrelson and juliette lewis can't salvage this busy mess . the first hour of natural born killers is made watchable only by the intensity of the two stars . woody harrelson stretches himself as never before , his simpleton charm connecting to a genuine amorality , while juliette lewis takes her wounded white-trash act from kalifornia and runs with it , exploding at arbitrary moments into astonishing ferocity . but for all their sound and fury , mickey and mallory aren't really characters . they're ciphers , stick-figure representations of a societal ill , and ciphers just aren't all that interesting . the technical flotsam and jetsam surrounding them can't disguise that fact , and only the positively inspired segment casting mallory's home life as a twisted 1950s sitcom goes anywhere beneath the surface . as it nears its mid-point , mickey and mallory's road show becomes extremely tedious . as over-the-top as they are , they seem at least remotely grounded in humanity , unlike our surreal chauffeurs through the netherworld . " look at what the media has done to us , " he says with genuine shock and , of course , superiority . the problem is that it's the same idea that drove man bites dog . and kalifornia . and every one of those films told the same story better , without pumping steroids into the production . there is no satire to the excesses of natural born killers , because oliver stone has no idea how to achieve that level of subtlety . if natural born killers had been made by any other director , i might have given it grudging support simply for having the courage to run to the limit in its audacious originality . unfortunately , i have lost all patience with stone's pedantry-as-art approach to filmmaking . compare the first hour of natural born killers with david lynch's wild at heart , which leavened its shock value with a warped sense of humor and simmering menace , and you'll see that what stone attempted to accomplish could have been done right . you just want it to stop . 
director : mel smith . a couple of years ago , director barry levinson made a movie based on a twenty-year-old idea . this pet project was loud , heavy-handed and self-indulgent , and clearly showed why it hadn't been made twenty years earlier : it wasn't a very good idea . however , levinson had acquired the cachet to make any movie he wanted to make , so he made toys . george lucas has even more cachet , and he also decided to produce a twenty-year-old idea . radioland murders is an attempt at farce that is simply chaotic and grating , and its frantic pace can't disguise the fact that it just isn't funny . however , there is a lot more going on backstage than onstage . for nearly its entire first hour , radioland murders succeeded primarily in giving me a terrible headache . the story rockets from character to character , lingering just long enough to let us see that each one is defined almost exclusively by a single annoying character trait . subtle nuance in characterization may be too much to expect from a broad comedy like radioland murders , but it's still a problem when virtually the entire cast is so irritatingly one-note that you begin hoping various characters will be the next to die . they are also stuck with dialogue that must have had whiskers on it in 1939 , like the ever-uproarious " you may think you know what i know , but i don't think you know what you think you know " bit . the slapstick is better , but it too is simply too stale to sustain the energy . every time he does so , radioland murders just stops dead , and it's not worth the jerky ride simply to see cameos by billy barty , rosemary clooney and george burns . ultimately , that decision is indicative of what is most wrong with radioland murders : no one seems clear exactly what it is supposed to be . a backstage farce a la noises off ? a romantic comedy ? lucas and his team of screenwriters seem to want it all , and as a result they end up without much of anything . radioland murders is one of those unfortunate films which equates loud and fast with entertaining , when in reality it's simply noisy and busy . 
while he worked on other projects , he would shoot pieces of don quixote here and there , in the hope that some day he would have the financing necessary to complete the project . they have done welles' memory a tremendous disservice in the process . don quixote is a monumental disappointment , with only glimpses of welles' brilliance emerging from an exercise in editing butchery . this collision of eras is the heart of welles' vision for don quixote , and to the extent that it survives the film is thought- provoking . and we see that this is what has occurred ; welles skillfully frames shots that include a billboard for " don quixote cerveza " and the restaurante don qixote , emphasizing the character's nature as an icon . unfortunately , don quixote takes nearly an hour to get to its contemporary setting , and that hour occasionally borders on the unwatchable . it is not simply that the quality of the print is sometimes horrible . there is simply no rhythm to the story , and it feels for all the world like pieces of film stuck together at random . as striking as some of welles' images are , editing director jess franco simply had no idea what to do with them , and apparently even changed some of the editing welles * had * managed to complete before his death . another huge problem with the film involves the dialogue dubbing . although two other actors portray don quixote and sancho panza , their parts were filmed silent , with welles himself to dub both voices . however , only portions of welles' dialogue were recorded , and where his dialogue doesn't exist , two other actors were used to provide the voices . not only is the shift between welles' voice and that of two other men jarring , but the two other actors do not even come close to the spirit of the vocal performances welles was providing . don quixote and sancho panza are not even the same characters from one scene to the next , and at times the appalling modern voiceovers are simply laughable . the version of don quixote which screened at san jose's cinequest film festival is not the same as the one which made its american premiere at the museum of modern art . oja kodar , welles' companion during the last years of his life , and frequent welles cinematographer gary graber trimmed a 113-minute version to just under 90 minutes , and it would be an easy knock at the film to say that any changes which made it shorter still would be a further improvement . but there's really no way of knowing , and that's the real point . using guesswork and very little talent , a bunch of well-intentioned film buffs tried to piece together a lot of raw footage into something resembling the work of one of the greatest filmmakers of all time . 
screenplay/director : luc besson . i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick . it boasts extremely glossy cinematography , a couple of recognizable name actors , and a couple of fairly impressive explosions . it's also basically about violence and cheap titilation , and features a central relationship between a middle-aged man and a twelve-year-old girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension . the professional is all over the map , and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant . writer/director luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita , a slick potboiler about a female assassin . there is no question that besson can make a great * looking * film ; with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast , he has created a film chock full of moody close-ups and evocative lighting . but beneath the shiny wrapper , there isn't nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe . the relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop . leon is mostly a collection of quirky traits , all intended to show us that for a hired killer , he's really not so bad a guy : he drinks lots of milk , takes meticulous care of a potted plant , and enjoys gene kelly movies . jean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted and desperate quality , but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda . natalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality , but she doesn't have too much to work with , either . besson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life , and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing . a silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place , as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover ; character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag . gary oldman's entire part is something of a cheap gag , wild-eyed and way over the top , but at least he is interesting to watch . there isn't a real person to be found anywhere in the professional , which isn't always a problem in an action thriller , except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more . a more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of a twelve-year-old in a really distasteful way . this is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9mm pistol , or the blood which is spilled aplenty . a great deal of the time , the professional is just plain sleazy , and all the soft filters in the world can't disguise that fact . 
while watching drop zone , i kept thinking about those ski films warren miller has been making for years . you know the ones--they're basically a bunch of impressive stunts and nice photography . well , drop zone looks like a skydiving version of one of those films , to which someone has attempted to add a plot . i emphasize the word " attempted , " and it's an extremely lackluster attempt at that . there is some great aerial footage in drop zone , but the story is a complete bore , and wesley snipes continues to bury himself in z-grade action films . we've already had one skydiving movie this year ( terminal velocity ) , and it wasn't a particularly good one . however , terminal velocity did have one very important thing going for it--no one involved seemed to be taking themselves at all seriously . it was light-hearted , and occasionally quite funny . drop zone , on the other hand , is best taken with meals as a mild sedative . it's not stretching the point to say that the plot between skydiving sequences in drop zone is somewhere on the order of the plot between sex scenes in your standard x-rated film . of course , as with that example , most viewers probably aren't coming to drop zone for riveting plot turns and crackling dialogue . the skydiving sequences are fantastic , perhaps the best i've ever seen . they are creatively shot , and include some impressive synchronized stunts . as long as drop zone is in the air , it is something quite exciting . then it hits ground again , and it burns in hard . after beginning as a rip-off of passenger 57 , drop zone ends like a rip-off of die hard , and a really bad one at that . gary busey delivers a performance that has stamps on it , practically sighing audibly as he wanders through a half-hearted version of his under siege psycho act . it is inexcusable in an action thriller to have a boring villain , and busey has not an ounce of charisma in this role . director john badham has made exciting films in the past , but even he appears to be slumming here . while the action in the air ( which was not his to shoot ) is great , the action on the ground is often ineptly staged and badly edited . what is genuinely depressing is watching the direction wesley snipes' career is taking . snipes is a fine actor with a tremendous range , but for a few years now he has appeared almost exclusively in bad action films . but snipes should really think about taking a few character parts that force producers to take him seriously as an actor , and for him to have a chance at the kind of roles samuel l . jackson and laurence fishburne are given a shot at . his performance in drop zone is thoroughly competent , but that's all it has to be . if he contines to appear in films like drop zone , he might as well take his career and jump out of a plane with it . without a parachute . 
screenplay : peter farrelly , bennett yulin and bobby farrelly . director : peter farrelly . 1994 at the movies had many stories , but none may be as unlikely as the emergence of jim carrey as one of the biggest box office draws in the country . i enjoyed both films on their own merits because they were made by directors who had the good sense to get out of the way and let carrey do what he does best : be a walking cartoon . dumb and dumber is the kind of movie for which " sophomoric " would be a compliment , but it could have worked with carrey's unique gifts at center stage . instead , it's just plain stupid , and about as badly put together a movie as i saw all year . we've all seen comedies where every funny moment was already in the previews , but dumb and dumber falls into an entirely new category . not only is the preview funnier than the movie , but it contains different takes of the same scene than ended up in the final product , and in every case the take that was used in the preview was funnier . it looks like director peter farrelly turned all his raw footage over to a trailer production company , then promptly proved that he should have given them the final cut on his movie . farrelly , quite simply put , does not appear to have the slightest clue about comic timing . jim carrey knows plenty about comic timing , but he is really adrift here , particularly in the first hour . i have this feeling that somewhere on a cutting room floor is a very funny performance , but it's not on the screen in dumb and dumber . there are a few moments when carrey gets to show off his talents , particularly an extended fantasy sequence which includes an exaggerated kung fu battle in a restaurant , but director farrelly ( working from a script co-written with brother bobby and bennett yellin ) appears determined not to let dumb and dumber become a jim carrey showcase . and while daniels is a solid if unspectacular dramatic actor , he is way out of is element here . you've got to respect him for trying a part so far from his image , but only for brief flashes is he a convincing moron . once the twosome gets to aspen , there are more laughs by far . the spectacle of carrey and daniels in gloriously hideous tuxedos , bright orange and powder blue respectively , is enough to prompt a laugh , and a hilariously gross scene finds daniels suffering the effects of a massive dose of laxative . but for the majority of its running time , dumb and dumber cranks out gags so predictable i was minutes ahead of the punch lines . to be fair , i don't think i'm in the target audience for dumb and dumber ; the fifty or so middle-schoolers at my showing laughed loud and often . 
screenplay : jeb stuart & peter stone . director : arne glimcher . and what is astonishing about all three of these examples is that for the longest time , few people really thought of any of them as good actors . he is an impressive presence in just cause , but he is wasted . just cause is a sorry excuse for a thriller , with both narrative and character handled with remarkable ineptitude . the cast of just cause is loaded with talent , and that alone offered a great deal of promise . kate capshaw takes a step up from her blink-and-you'll-miss-it role in love affair , but she isn't really subtle enough an actor to make the stock threatened wife role anything interesting . blair underwood has a few nice moments early , but he too is saddled with a shallow character with some really unpleasant undertones . then there is connery , who can do wonders with a wry smile but is trapped in a character that looks like it was abandoned by writers jeb stuart and peter stone two-thirds of the way through and completed by computer . there is some suggestion early in the film that there is a reason armstrong hasn't practiced law in 25 years , a reason which will play a role in ferguson's case . again there is the suggestion that there is a dark , guilty secret in armstrong's past , but there is never another mention of the issue . actually , describing the plot as " developing " is something of an overstatement . just cause is a completely predictable thriller , with deus ex machina clues popping up for armstrong to discover and a plot twist which was nearly inevitable . director arne glimcher doesn't appear to have a single original idea for how to construct a film like this , so he puts together ideas from a hundred other mundane thrillers : a car chase here , a woman in distress there , a serial killer , a mano-a-mano in the everglades and some moody lighting . but there's just no point to any of it . just cause fails to generate an ounce of tension because tension depends on unpredictability and characters we genuinely want to see survive the danger . i was actually kind of hoping that everyone would end up as gator bait . 
screenplay : andrew kevin walker and neal jimenez director : brett leonard . thriller-cum-horror films tend to come in two basic flavors . on one end you've got your high-school audience slasher film , one of those infinitely sequeled flicks based on a charismatic killer named freddy or chuckie or pinhead ; on the other end is your moody , upscale thriller , something that genuinely tries to be creepy and doesn't depend entirely on bursts of music or a cat leaping out at someone . there are about ten times as many of the former as the latter , and as a result i limit the films in the genre that i choose to see to those i have some moderate hope for . hideaway could have been one of the rare quality efforts , but instead of being ambitious , it's mostly just pretentious and gimmicky , and pretty dull besides . naturally , there are a few side effects : headaches , trouble sleeping and an unsettling tendency to see visions of murders . based on the novel by dean koontz , hideaway has some fairly promising psychological material at its core . these issues could have been utilized to make hideaway something more than standard issue supernatural horror fare , but director brett leonard refuses to let character matter . while not nearly as techno-happy as he was in his previous film the lawnmower man , leonard still makes hideaway too much about filtered shots ( used to simulate hatch's visions ) and some absurd computer- generated visions of the afterlife . at least the computer tricks are moderately interesting to look at . hideaway is mostly a big fat bore , full of performances which could politely be called somnabulistic . it often appears as though in between takes he was watching his own performance in the fly and wondering , " how did i do that ? " it is jeremy sisto who really deserves our pity , though . his teen psycho could have been fascinating and even sympathetic , but he is turned into a tiresome heavy-metal-listenin' , sunglasses-at-night-wearin' , virgin-sacrificin' , black-candle-lightin' , devil-worshippin' plot device . hideaway completely implodes with a preposterous climax which reduces the eternal battle between good and evil to a cool psychedelic light show , with a life-affirming vision from beyond thrown in for good measure . it is , however , merely the logical culmination of an incompetent directing job which can't even seem to do cliches right . hideaway is a good idea for a thriller ; if only it had been scary . or different . or * something * . 
a movie about divorce and custody in 1995 seems about as timely as a movie about mood rings . family breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american landscape for nearly thirty years , and countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious court battles in hand-wringing detail . still , i can't recall a comedy about the subject before bye bye love . and after it , i still can't . bye bye love is rarely funny , more often a weak and melodramatic retread of common tv-movie fare . only a few moments which have nothing to do with the film's main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion . the three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo , and the quality of their performances is of widely varying quality . randy quaid is the best of the three , bitter without being irritating , gleefully spiteful without being frightening . he does get bye bye love's best sub-plot , a hilarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo , and he does a great slow burn . paul reiser really has only one character , his slightly befuddled , uptight nice guy " mad about you " persona , but he does it well . as a personality , he is appealing , but as a character , he becomes pretty boring here . matthew modine , is , quite simply , terrible . this isn't a performance good enough to be called mailed-in ; he even forgot to put a stamp on it . modine lacks any charm in an appallingly under-written role , looks bored most of the time , and gets stuck with a trite little speech about how it's all his father's fault he's such a cad . bye bye love basically comes off as a very confused movie , because it spends far too much of its time on the new relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers and their kids , making it just another " dating in the 90s " movie . when the movie does deal with the children at all , it is to have one of them scream out an accusation and/or cry , perhaps to be resolved later by a sensitive talk and a hug , perhaps not . it is a sad end to flanders' career , getting caught up in a truly annoying over-use of mcdonald's as a location , a plot device and , apparently , a major advertiser . even if bye bye love had decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on the parent-child relationships , it still would have been pretty difficult to pull off , because ultimately there is very little humor one can wring from family break-ups and their effects on children . any way you slice it , it is a bad situation for kids , and the makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings when dealing with the single parenting issue . it is left to the dads' romantic fumblings to probide what little humor there is , and it isn't enough . there have been comparisons between bye bye love and parenthood , but parenthood was both genuinely funny and genuinely touching . bye bye love is a genuine shame . 
screenplay : ruth prawer jhabvala . director : james ivory . if ismail merchant and james ivory are not careful , their names might very well lose their proper noun status . like q-tip or xerox , " merchant ivory " is becoming something of a generic term , a descriptor for intimate period pieces in the tradition of critical successes like a room with a view , howards end and the remains of the day . for many moviegoers , though , the term is also used to evoke images of technically proficient but turgid filmmaking . sadly , jefferson in paris is everything their most vocal detractors have accused merchant ivory efforts of being . there are plenty of beautiful sets , meaningful glances and profound discussions , but there isn't a shred of compelling drama to connect them , or a single key character into whose life we are given any insight . this is not a biographical sketch with a point of view . it's a series of anecdotes , many of them apocryphal . or a lengthy scene at an opera in which the relationship between jefferson and maria cosway is not furthered one bit ? writer ruth prawer jhabvala is a genius at adapting the narratives of other writers for the screen , but she does a terrible job of constructing a narrative from a collection of historical footnotes . this is simply everything you always wanted to know about thomas jefferson but were afraid to ask . it is an awful performance of a character with tremendous potential , and the script never even bothers to try to get inside his head . i felt i had a better understanding of jefferson from staring at mount rushmore . ivory does deliver some finely crafted scenes , of course , such as louis xvi learning about the revolution while on a hunt , and richard robbins' score and tony pierce-roberts' cinematography are characteristically superb . it isn't about the scandalous , if historically questionable , notion that jefferson fathered children by one of his slaves . it isn't really * about * anything . like the worst high school history textbooks , it just starts in one place and ends in another , and all you really want to do is look at the pictures . 
the recipe for the phantom is the result of the kind of perverse logic which produces some of hollywood's most spectacular flops . there is a super-hero in a form-fitting costume , because the people seemed to love it in superman and batman ; there is derring-do in the 1930s involving mysterious and powerful relics , because the people seemed to love it in the indiana jones films ; there is a nasty industrialist and a feisty heroine because , well , the people always seem to love that . in short , the phantom is an action-adventure frankenstein's monster , cobbled together from pieces of other much better films -- and then nobody remembered to give it a jolt of energy . if the phantom resembles any other recent attempt at cinematic super-heroism , it is 1994's bomb the shadow . it is a film which never once carves out for itself a distinct theme -- too straight most of the time to be camp , and too dumb to work as a rousing adventure . wincer likes to let his stories unfold at a leisurely pace , but there isn't much of a story to unfold in the phantom . that leaves him with action set pieces which are slow , perfunctory , and lacking a unique flavor . the phantom feels like the work of a director who simply never had an idea about what to do with the material . to be fair to wincer , that appears to be true of the cast as well . similarly , megalomania has never seemed as charming and unthreatening as it does coming from treat williams , in one of the least interesting villain performances in recent memory . when cary-hiroyuki tagawa turns up as pirate lord kabai sengh nearly 90 minutes into the phantom , i found myself utterly stumped as to why he wasn't the primary bad guy , since at least he had charisma . and pity poor kristy swanson , trying so hard to be a spunky liberated woman that she never bothers to notice that she doesn't have a character to play . rarely have i seen a so-called adventure film in which so many participants seemed to be going through the motions like basketball players on the wrong side of a blow-out , wrestling with a thoroughly synthetic script . jeffrey boam ( indiana jones and the last crusade , lethal weapon 2 & 3 ) knows how to work with established characters in an established formula , and that's the way he approaches the phantom : as though we already know the drill , he's just filling in the blanks , and the phantom character's status as antecedent to modern action films shields it from charges of wholesale theft . but it simply isn't the case that his audience is essentially familiar with the phantom . 
screenplay : michael crichton , anne-marie martin . director : jan debont . the makers of big-budget summer movies and those who attend those movies appear to have come to an understanding , an understanding best exemplified by an observation i made while watching twister . several times during the film , there would come a point where it would become clear that the latest sequence showcasing industrial light & magic's computer-generated tornados was at an end ( it usually coincided with the dialogue once again becoming audible ) , at which point several members of the audience would stand up and quickly make their way towards the restroom . they were probably rather secure in the knowledge that they would not miss any crucial plot twists or juicy bits of character development during these brief expository interludes , and even if they did , they were not missing what they had come to the film to see . not a penny of the money they had plunked down would be wasted if they missed a couple of the characters engaged in conversation . it is this complicity which produces monotonous displays of technological prowess like twister , a film with a script that makes jurassic park's look positively labyrinthine by comparison . i suppose you have to give the creators of twister credit for coming up with a premise which involves people trying their damnedest to get close to tornados rather than trying their damnedest to get very far away ; it could have been even more tedious . the problem is that it doesn't take long before twister starts to look like a loop film . there are only so many ways you can film a bunch of vehicles driving through fields , over dirt roads , along highways before it becomes a chore to watch , and while director jan debont uses every swooping trick at his disposal , there is an awful lot of nothing going on during twister an awful lot of the time . there may be more driving in twister than there was in debont's debut feature speed . hunt is probably a better actor than bullock , and certainly provides the requisite cuteness factor , but bullock's heroine was able to comment on speed's improbability throughout the film with her priceless reactions . the trite love/hate relationship with which hunt is saddled is something no one could tunnel out from under , and neither she nor paxton has the big screen charisma to make the scenes without inclement weather anything but a monumental bore . every single character manages the astonishing non-euclidean feat of being less than one-dimensional , with characterization coming in such subtle forms as the fleet of identical black mini-vans used by elwes' corporate scientists ( as though you actually needed to see the three 6's behind his ear ) or the van halen tunes blasted by one of hunt's more annoyingly quirky cohorts ( philip seymour hoffman ) . films like twister are often defended with comparisons to amusement park rides -- that they make up in thrills what they lack in drama . i don't think twister even qualifies as a roller-coaster . yes , the visual effects are impressive , but it is impossible to watch them with anything but detachment , because as much as debont tries , he can't imbue a natural phenomenon with a personality ( he actually tries harder than he does with his actors ) . twister is a surprisingly gloomy and inert experience , with exactly two flashes of inspiration through its two hour running time . when they come , they only serve to remind you what the rest of the film is lacking : any sense of the fun that summer movies are supposed to provide . whatever one might think of the increasing mindlessness of effects-driven blockbusters , you'd think they could at least manage to entertain , or to give you a reason to come back when you get up to go to the restroom . 
screenplay : j . f . lawton , michael bortman . director : andrew davis . most of the time , it is fairly easy for me to put my finger on why a film didn't work for me : sloppy performances , inane writing , lackluster production , leaden direction , what have you . there is nothing aggressively unwatchable about this new action thriller , no glaring stupidity ; even keanu reeves didn't make me want to run screaming for the parking lot . yet i left the theater not just unimpressed , but unsatisfied , as though i had just left a restaurant without getting a bite to eat . chain reaction may be one of the most generic film experiences i have ever had , a chain of events without a single speck of personality . it would be easy enough to pick on chain reaction for its obviousness -- if you aren't aware that the government and oil companies would conspire to bury alternative fuel sources , you clearly haven't been doing your street-corner-leaflet reading -- but obviousness tends not to be terribly troublesome to most genre film viewers . no , the real problem is that chain reaction traffics in a kind of monotonous obviousness . those chases are fairly flat , however , and even paranoia becomes mundane in chain reaction . i suppose you can't blame davis for returning to familiar territory after the dismal steal big , steal little , but the familiar in this case has left him wholly uninspired . i think there is also a rather important lesson which davis failed to take away from the fugitive , namely that for a plot of that kind to work , it is fairly important for the hero to be someone you want to root for . harrison ford's richard kimble may not have had a complex history , but at least you knew he had a history . eddie and lily aren't even stock characters in the service of this plot . . . they're one of the reasons chain reaction feels so dead is that every person in the film might as well _be_ dead , even the ordinarily ultra-sinister brian cox as a nasty cia operative . i will give chain reaction credit for casting keanu reeves in a role where he can do little damage . eddie probably has two dozen lines in the whole film , and a quiet keanu is a tolerable keanu . i will also give credit for casting morgan freeman , period . even in a torpid piece of film-making like this , he commands attention , and his speech about the consequences of this new fuel takes on weight just because it is freeman who delivers it . and i will give credit for a welcome refusal to explain the pseudo-science which allows the water-fuel to work . i just wish it could have generated some energy for this film . to borrow the over-worked comparison of action film to amusement park ride , chain reaction is more like the kiddie train at a petting zoo . it just goes around and around and around . . . and then stops . 
screenplay : john carpenter , debra hill , kurt russell . director : john carpenter . let's face it , this isn't exactly indiana jones we're talking about -- kurt russell's snake plissken last graced theater screens fifteen years ago in escape from new york , when a significant percentage of today's action film audience was somewhere between puberty and mastering solid food , and that film was not what one would call a classic of the genre . the result is an attempt at self-satire which comes off as a tiresome exercise in pyrotechnics and cheap blue screen effects . it is a good thing carpenter , russell and company waited so long between new york and l . a . , because even those who actually saw the first film probably have forgotten enough not to notice that escape from l . a . is virtually a point-for-point remake of the original . the number of duplicated details is quite astonishing , actually . the twist they try to place on escape from l . a . is that it is supposed to be funnier , almost a parody of the original . i say " supposed to " because john carpenter may be one of the most humorless directors of the last twenty years , taking even bizarre material like big trouble in little china and deadening it with his brooding style . his idea of a joke in escape from l . a . is showing every possible southern california landmark ( hey , it's universal studios ! . . . hey , it's the queen mary ! ) or making a quick reference to every possible stereotype of los angeles living , and to show that he isn't taking anything seriously with some low-tech special effects , including a computer-generated submarine voyage which makes tron look positively state-of-the-art . a few of the gags are clever , like a shot at l . a . 's front-running sports fans ; others can't find a comfortable place between gruesome and silly , like a gang of cosmetic surgery victims always in search of fresh body parts . escape from new york was overly somber , but it was lean and efficient and quite good at creating its desolate urban landscape . there are a few simple pleasures to be found in the performances , including kurt russell's laconic snake . it's one of the best ( if unintentional ) jokes that despite the fact that everyone in the world seems to know who snake plissken is , he has probably been able to escape capture because he has no discernible personality . russell does a guttural clint eastwood impression , and makes a solid anti-hero . snake may be back , but he doesn't have much to say , and what he does have to say has been said before . 
screenplay : richard stanley , ron hutchinson . director : john frankenheimer . sounds like the making of apocalypse now , right down to the presence of brando . the end result . moreau is just a nightmare . moreau is based has been committed to film twice before , in 1933 and 1977 , and naturally this version tries very hard to convince us that there is a compelling reason to do it again , and important themes the other versions failed to uncover . the great revelation in the script ( credited to hutchinson and erstwhile director stanley ) is -- get this -- that humans are actually quite animalistic themselves . this bit of wisdom worth of the burning bush is delivered scattershot -- a piece here in the split-second intro which finds a pair of thewlis' fellow survivors throwing themselves to a conveniently circling shark in a fight over water , a piece there in a montage of documentary footage you expect to be underscored by " imagine . " it's all spectacularly sloppy , but it's hard to know whom to blame . stanley might have wanted to do a cerebral observation on violence and/or religion , but frankenheimer seems to want a good old thriller , and the two angles are not at all complementary . somebody cut this film to ribbons trying to find a point to it all , resulting in a giddy incomprehensibility . exactly what was douglas' role in moreau's experiments supposed to be , anyway ? moreau just keeps staggering forward and swinging wildly , like an overweight boxer without the faintest glimmer of strategy . speaking of overweight . . . oh , but that's far too easy . it would be too simple to observe that when brando makes his first appearance , covered in heavy white makeup and a white muu-muu the size of a circus tent , he looks like nothing so much as the michelin man on safari . it's too simple and somewhat unfair , because even under the burden of all that weight and a ridiculous accent , there is still something compelling about brando on screen . his moreau is what richard attenborough should have been trying to go for as hammond in jurassic park , a pleasant enough chap with a monstrous god complex . val kilmer , who is said to have quite a god complex in real life , seems to have decided to act in a completely different film , one which is much more fun . his montgomery is a casually nasty pot-head , but at least he is entertaining to watch , particularly when he does his dead-on brando impression . and poor david thewlis , whose character has no common sense and no particular reason for being a u . n . peace negotiator ( you'd think that might have been a useful subtext to the war which breaks out on the island ) , tries to look frightened by more than the lack of direction in the film , with little success . but this is a badly fragmented piece of work which manages to achieve tedium in only 96 minutes . perhaps some day they will make a documentary about the making of the film , like they did with apocalypse now in hearts of darkness . then maybe it won't have been a total loss . 
screenplay : amy holden jones . producers : roger birnbaum , julie bergman sender . running time : 96 minutes . i'm walking on very thin ice as i prepare to discuss the rich man's wife , because in order to explain what is really wrong with it , i'm going to have to reveal some critical plot details . sure , i could try to tap-dance around it , but in so doing the context would probably still make it clear what to expect , and i wouldn't have the luxury of discussing particulars . so i'm going to do something i've never done before : i'm going to encourage you not to read this review if you have any intention of seeing the rich man's wife . please skip to the bottom , where you will note my less than enthusiastic rating , and avoid my point-by-point analysis of how a rather mundane thriller can become an actively annoying one . josie bolts at the suggestion -- and away from cole -- but cole decides to do the job anyway . that is a decent enough premise for a psychological thriller , but writer/director amy holden jones doesn't begin to make it pay off . after an interminable opening which takes several trite scenes to show us how unhappy the potenzas are when one good one should have done the job , the rich man's wife introduces us to cole , and any chance at originality vanishes . to peter greene's credit , he does the best he can with the part as written , which is as a happy-go-lucky sadist . if cole is more well-intentioned and genuinely obsessive in his murderous behavior , josie's dilemma becomes a more compelling one , one which might be solved by brains rather than by gunfire . but there was never really any chance for that to happen because -- here's the big revelation , so don't say i didn't warn you -- we discover in the film's final moments that josie herself engineered everything , and has been spinning an elaborate lie to the police . even though i smelled it coming as soon as i saw that the story was set up as a flashback , i still cringed when i saw halle berry smirk in triumph and get in the car with her co-conspirator nora ( clea lewis , in a performance which jump-starts the film with its only measure of intentional idiosyncrasy ) . not only had i been subjected to a mediocre thriller , but nothing i had seen mattered at all . the rich man's wife is an elaborate cheat , and the ending is an opportunity to dupe the audience into believing it had been watching something unusually clever instead of something unusually lazy . " ah , " some of you must be musing to yourselves , " but isn't that scenario he just described remarkably similar to the usual suspects , a film widely praised for its cleverness ? in one extremely significant way : in the rich man's wife , the ending serves absolutely no dramatic purpose . too few critics of the usual suspects gave it credit for making keaton's desire to go legitimate a critical element in the resolution of the story ; the final revelations make him a tragic character , and there is evidence to allow us to reach different conclusions . if the revelation that the story is an complete hoax serves any purpose , it is as an excuse for suspense cliches ( see , that's what they would be _expecting_ ) or for day to turn miraculously to night for added artificial tension . there is a smug pseudo-feminism in amy holden jones' script , a sense that we should be inspired to whoops of " you go , girls ! " but jones denies us the chance to under-estimate them because we're never allowed to estimate them in the first place . she isn't playing with expectations or with genre conventions . she's playing us for suckers . 
director : matthew broderick . running time : 119 minutes . here i offer a bit of free , friendly advice for film-makers : if you are going to make a two hour long film , please don't make it feel like a four hour long film . . . and for heaven's sake , don't title it infinity . you just can't feed a critic a straight line like that ; i'm only human , and it's too easy . infinity is a moebius strip of a movie experience , a film which goes on and on and on without a single compelling situation or character to hold your attention . under the rookie direction of matthew broderick , infinity inspires an almost suffocating boredom and the question of why he even bothered to hire an editor . on one level , infinity is a difficult film to hate actively , because it clearly was made with some care . the film is lovingly photographed by toyomichi kurita and scored by bruce broughton , and its period detail is meticulously re-created by production designer bernt capra . that makes infinity a nice film to look at , at least for a little while , until it becomes apparent that there is not a single thing going on worth caring about . the crushing flaw of infinity is that it is almost entirely about the romance between richard and arline , and not once does a spark fly between broderick and arquette . the script ( by broderick's mother patricia ) focuses on the intellectual nature of their relationship without paying much attention to developing them as individuals , resulting in characters constructed mostly of thick queens accents and episodic eccentricity . arquette is more successful at giving arline some small measure of appeal , but she is unable to make this love affair matter . with no other character in the film provided even a glimmer of a personality , infinity rapidly begins to sink under the weight of a painfully dull central relationship . it is not broderick's fault that the real-life circumstances of this story have arline dying for nearly four years , but it is definitely his fault that i was placed in the ghoulish position of hoping she would just get it over with and die already . for nearly ninety minutes arline is alternately sick and well , and over the course of that ninety minutes we move abstractly between richard's personal and professional life , with scene after scene inspiring me to throw up my hands in exasperation at the utter lack of a point . i counted ten scenes in infinity which literally served no narrative or dramatic purpose , and countless other instances where the judicious use of a knife on several hundred frames of film might have made me less eager to use one on my own throat . what it really does , however , is make for a love story without a drop of emotion until broderick breaks down in the film's last scene . at that point , i was sort of feeling like crying myself , mourning two hours of my life which had begun to feel like infinity . 
director of photography : kees van oostrum . mpaa rating : r ( violence , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 95 minutes . thinner is a positively dreadful piece of supposedly suspenseful dreck , positively obese with miserable decisions and laughable acting . bit too well , as the pounds begin to disappear uncontrollably . while most of the basic plot elements in stephen king's thinner match those in the novel , director and co-scripter tom holland ( who brought the nearly-as-wretched stephen king's the langoliers to tv screens last year ) has somehow managed to abandon every thematic thread which made the story interesting . king's popularity is based , i think , largely on his identification with the horror comics of his youth ; his stories have been contemporary morality tales with good triumphing over evil and poetic justice meted out in spades . that portrayal of billy is turned into a joke by robert john burke , whose performance is simply appalling . in both cases , there is not an ounce of intelligence in burke's performance , and not a trace of humanity . in fact , it is so broad that you might be tempted to believe that holland is playing the whole thing as a goofy horror-comedy like his child's play , with burke his punch-line-spewing chucky stand-in . if so , it is not nearly outlandish enough to be entertaining , and every scene is directed with such a plodding obviousness that it stephen king's thinner becomes a black hole of suspense . as just one example , imagine every possible way it might have been presented creatively that ginelli had poisoned the gypsies' dogs , then compare your idea to having mantegna say to the dogs , " how about a little strychnine ? " with bad readings of bad lines in badly directed scenes , thinner offers little but the opportunity to watch burke's prosthetic transformation from 290 pounds to 130 pounds . doubtfire , the mask ) , and it is impressive work . the " fat suit " ( full-body in one shower scene ) is excellent , but it was an even greater challenge to take 50 pounds off , and superb lighting helps cannom achieve that effect . still , all the latex in the world can't turn a cow pie into a chocolate mousse , and stephen king's thinner reeks of incompetence . it is going to be hard for king to distance himself from this one given his cameo as a pharmacist . 
director : garry marshall . screenplay : warren leight , ed kaplan . running time : 105 minutes . every movie-goer , whether he or she is conscious of it or not , has a list of warning flags that a movie could be trouble . sometimes it is as simple as an actor or genre to avoid ; other times , it can be a more subtle realization , like the risk of anything promoted with a soundtrack tie-in or a rave from jeff craig of " sixty second preview . " critics inevitably have longer lists by virtue of more extensive film experience , and i think i have just added another item to mine : beware of films with half a dozen gratuitous cameo appearances . the problem with that particular caveat is that by the time you are in the theater and subjected to the guest star deluge , it is too late . dear god , a miserable excuse for a " feel-good " comedy , is a film with no sense of direction whatsoever , causing a barrage of cameos to feel all the more desperate . dear god might have had a chance at being moderately amusing if it had stuck to the formula of a lovable rascal who undergoes a conversion . kinnear's smirking wise-guy persona is perfectly suited to the role of tom , and he can also trot out a chastened charm which ingratiates himself with the audience . the problem is that the car wreck of a script churned out by warren leight and ed kaplan includes so many minor characters and superfluous side plots that dear god becomes thoroughly incoherent . tom is given five sporadically interesting cohorts in the dead letter office where two truly interesting ones would have been a significant improvement , and even though both laurie metcalf and tim conway have nice comic moments , they are playing essentially the same character . things get so bloated that the sub-plot involving tom's loan shark ( john pinette ) vanishes into thin air when he is hit by a bus , as though even director garry marshall realized there was no screen time to spare . for a film overflowing with diversions , dear god is far from overflowing with laughs . since none of the business swirling around the actual plot of dear god is remotely funny , marshall spends most of the film finding places to insert random celebrities . here we have dr . joyce brothers appearing on television ; there we have o . j . simpson prosecutor christopher darden as a court broadcaster . the effect of these cameos is not simply to distract you from what the film is about , but to convince you that they _are_ what the film is about . dear god may begin as a comedy , but it rapidly turns into a bus tour of hollywood where the only response it inspires is pointing and giggling every time a familiar face appears . there are a few amusing bits in the courtroom finale which finds tom on trial for tampering with the mail , notably a goofy piece of acting by metcalf which at least will shake you out of your stupor . you might find yourself wishing it would turn into the re-hash of miracle on 34th street it seems headed for , so that at least it might make _cliched_ sense , only you wouldn't be surprised to find lance ito turning up as the judge , or buddy hackett as kris kringle . 
producers : john hughes and ricardo mestres . director : stephen herek . running time : 103 minutes , plus 7 minute short in some theaters . resolved : trained dogs are cute , and puppies scampering about are even cuter . if you would take the con position in an oxford-style debate on this point , then the live-action remake of disney's 101 dalmatians is not going to be your cup of kibble . 101 dalmatians was made not simply with an awareness of the usefulness of cute animals in the making of a family film ; it seems to have been constructed around that awareness . there is such a crass calculation to the use of its canine stars as bringers of innocent grins that the dogs don't even counteract the brain-damaging slapstick which is john hughes's stock-in-trade . somehow , they make it worse . delivered for the holiday season in a big glossy bow , 101 dalmatians is a spectacularly packaged box of foul-smelling air . the 1961 animated version of 101 dalmatians was far from the best of disney's self-proclaimed " masterpieces , " but it had a low-key charm even in the bumblings of horace and jasper . now the material has been entrusted to writer-producer john hughes , whose basic film-making philosophy is " if more is better , and even more is even better , then please-make-it-stop too much is just right . " even the magnificent , maleficent cruella is not safe from the onslaught of indignities , falling first into a vat of molasses and then into a pile of manure . it is a sign of hughes's love affair with " america's funniest home videos " humor that he replaces the original's most memorable suspense sequence -- the puppies' attempt to slip past cruella disguised as black labradors -- and replaces it with a scene in a barn which ends with a pig landing on cruella's chest . glenn close has obvious fun as cruella , playing her as an imperious drag queen , but i'm mystified by raves for her performance . there is no doubt that close can be scary -- she scared a generation of married men into zipping up their pants in fatal attraction -- but there is no malevolence in her characterization of cruella . disney's great villains were real threats , and they didn't take pratfalls ; cruella has horace and jasper so that _they_ can be the comic relief while she spooks the little ones . close cuts a fine figure in cruella's outrageous outfits and commanding some impressive sets , and she is about as intimidating as rupaul . then there are those adorable puppies . there is no point arguing that kids and many adults won't enjoy the frolicking dalmatians , because they will . there are a few marvelously trained animals in 101 dalmatians , and they provide some amusing moments . you could also get the same reaction out of most kids if you sat them down in front of a home movie of puppies playing , or an old episode of " those amazing animals , " or even a westminster dog show on espn2 , because reaction to the dogs in 101 dalmatians is not based on any kind of plot requiring individual personality for the animal characters . though the same kind of animatronic critters used in babe are used in 101 dalmatians , the animals don't talk here . not only does that make for some confusing narrative ( one scene found several kids around me perplexed as to why lucky was still in danger ) , but it makes the canine cast of 101 dalmatians little more than a big spotted blur . a certain kind of manipulative drama has long been called a " tear-jerker , " and 101 dalmatians is the family film equivalent . it's an " awww-jeker , " trotting out the adorable little puppies and having them yap at you until you begin to consider turning them into a coat yourself . 
screenplay : lewis colick . producers : nicholas palelogos , andrew scheinman , frederick zollo , rob reiner . director : rob reiner . mpaa rating : r ( violence , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 130 minutes . it took watching a time to kill for the second time in less than a year for me to realize that i had been too easy on it the first time around . actually , it wasn't a time to kill i saw the second time -- it was ghosts of mississippi -- but that's merely a technicality . the premise is simplistic and obvious , but at least a time to kill featured some strong performances . ghosts of mississippi is a plodding , ridiculously earnest film in which any potential drama gets water-logged in a big puddle of white liberal guilt . though the evidence against beckwith is strong , the presence of more than a few similarly minded witnesses and jurors results in two hung juries in 1964 . this is a film which wants you to leave with the message " racism is bad " tattooed across your backbrain , and i suppose you'd have to say that it succeeds . unfortunately , reiner and writer lewis colick spoon-feed that message to the audience like it was cough syrup ; they are so concerned with making ghosts of mississippi good for you that they don't take the time to make it good . many of the same problems were evident in a time to kill , along with more than a few of the same specific plot details . the hero's wife admonishes him for his irresponsibility , anonymous racists vandalize his property , and a threat to his family merely serves to stiffen his resolve -- all familiar elements in serious-minded social dramas . at lest a time to kill had the benefit of some strong performances to give the stock scenarios some spark , though . as rabble-rousing as a time to kill managed to be at times , at least there appeared to be a few characters in it who were passionate about the incendiary issues involved . you might expect some energy from james woods as the unrepentant bigot , and to a certain extent you get it . there is such an obvious build-up toward a big courtroom confrontation between beckwith and bobby that you can almost hear rob reiner in the background coaching woods on his " you can't handle the truth " speech , yet that moment never comes . and i found myself missing it , as melodramatic and historically inaccurate as it might have been , because at least it would have given ghosts of mississippi a fire to match its sincerity . i'm sure everyone involved felt they had made an important film , and in one sense they have : it is important to remember that even sentiments this honorable needs to have an interesting story to tell . this mississippi isn't burning . . . it's boring . 
screenplay : pete dexter & jim quinlan and nora ephron and delia ephron . director : nora ephron . mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 100 minutes . nora ephron still has a lot to learn about making movies . sleepless coasted on the charm of its stars and a painstakingly manufactured sense of whimsy ; mixed nuts collapsed into a chaotic holiday mess . in michael , ephron attempts to meld genial romantic comedy with irreverent fantasy , and the result is one of the most mis-guided high-concept films to come out of hollywood in years . an eccentric angel enjoying a final go-around on earth is an interesting concept , and john travolta certainly appears to be having a great time with it . his early scenes are a riot -- a slovenly descent of the stairs , dragging wings behind his bloated bare chest , followed by a breakfast of alarmingly over-sugared frosted flakes -- but then he becomes strangely sedate , even when he gets into a barroom brawl . as an over-eager celestial rascal , michael could have been an entertaining character to follow , but ephron appears worried that a lusty angel might be too offensive . ephron and her sister delia probably contributed the romantic plot to the mix , a plot which eventually subsumes michael's story entirely . hurt , playing yet another variation on his emotionally wounded accidental tourist persona , is the lost soul in need of redemption ; macdowell does a predictable turn as a sketchy dog trainer-cum-aspiring country singer . they are never nearly as interesting as michael , though , and this budding romance usually acts as a distraction between the angel's unpredictable pranks . it is difficult to get wrapped up in the subtleties of a relationship while you're watching john travolta lead a seductive dance to " chain of fools " or head-butt a bull into animatronic submission . michael is unfocused and disappointing for nearly all of its running time , but it is in the final twenty minutes that it becomes absolutely insufferable . when the dog's fate after a run-in with a truck becomes michael's major plot point , you know ephron is willing to do absolutely anything to crank up the audience's sympathy . she doesn't give a single character a consistent personality ( except hoskins as the grouchy editor ) , and she makes indefensible choices in editing and shot selection which break up momentum and make two-thirds of the frame useless . in short , nearly every decision nora ephron makes leads you to the conclusion that she had no idea how to make michael a cohesive , coherent film . i think michael was supposed to be about someone who needed guidance . i'm fairly sure it was made _by_ someone who needed guidance . 
screenplay : randy feldman . mpaa rating : r ( strong profanity , violence , brief nudity ) running time : 115 minutes . a romantic interest . an explosion . yawn . yawn . yawn . the preceding has been the plot of approximately twelve thousand and six action films ; this one just happens to be called metro . i have learned to expect little from films like metro , and consequently i am bored by them more often than i am genuinely disappointed . with eddie murphy on board , however , you hope for something extra , some kind of spark . when a film makes watching eddie murphy a tedious experience , you know it is doing something terribly wrong . metro ( the title , in case you are wondering , means absolutely nothing ) is so badly put together that even the most casual viewer may notice the miserable pacing and stray plot threads . you can't blame murphy for being unable to muster any enthusiasm for the scenes with his bland leading lady , but he should have known better than to take this role at all . the script seems to have been doctored for him , with a gambling problem turned into a bit of character color and his supposed inability to form relationships turned into a cause for gags rather than actual conflict , yet there is still too little comedy for murphy to work with . for much of the film , he walks around with an intense frown , and it is over 90 minutes into metro before you hear that trademark laugh for the first time . murphy is stranded with too few solid punch lines , and nearly all of the ones he does have bounce of ejogo and fall to the ground limply . i suppose i should give director thomas carter credit for taking the obligatory san francisco car chase ( how much do you want to bet on the likelihood of seeing a car soar over a hill ? ) and doing a few interesting things with it . as vehicles are sent flying and passengers sent sprawling by a runaway cable car , it is possible at least for a moment to take some pleasure in a goofy spin on a familiar situation . carter does an even better job by taking that old suspense stand-by -- the medicine cabinet mirror which will close to reveal a killer standing behind someone -- and using it to defuse tension not once , but _twice_ . the fact that carter was able to demonstrate even that much recognition of cliches , and a willingness to subvert them , makes his involvement in the rest of the disaster that is metro all the more puzzling . an action film like this plods so relentlessly and obviously from point a to point b to point c that you might find yourself shouting out " point c ! " while they're still getting to point b , or getting up with the rest of the audience after the big explosion which signals that nothing else of any consequence is going to happen . 
screenplay : darrell roodt and greg latter . director : darrell james roodt . least nominally . i believe that is part of the point roodt is trying to make -- that post-apartheid south africa has become a dangerous ground of a different kind , much like the american inner cities -- but he has chosen a singularly monotonous and pedantic way of doing it . just beyond the nods to african culture and the wall of homilies you will find a dreary guns-and-drugs picture that feels like the least inspired of a hundred guns-and-drugs pictures you might have seen before . only the accents have been changed to distinguish the guilty . once you acknowledge the sociological curiosity , you are left with a film lacking anything new or interesting to say as a story . it doesn't help matters that ice cube is woefully miscast in the lead role . ice cube has proven that he can act , and he has a powerful screen presence , but the character he is playing is supposed to be a doctoral student in literature who has lost touch with " the struggle " while ensconced in the ivory tower . it is also a terribly one-dimensional performance ; it often seems that if he didn't have something to scowl at , there wouldn't be any reason for him to have a face . to be fair to ice cube , i don't think there's much that anyone could have done with such a ridiculous character . if i were asked to deliver lines like " that's how you fight a war . . . with education , " or , " guns are for cowards , not warriors , " i'd probably spend the entire film scowling , too . the main problem with dangerous ground even as visceral entertainment is that roodt doesn't know how to do it . he has written himself into a corner by setting up a story like american urban crime stories , but he seems wildly uncomfortable filming traditional action scenes . the result is perhaps the least interesting car chase in recent cinematic history , as two cars chase each other around the spiraling levels of a parking garage , and a climactic gunfight which is edited more with an interest in getting it over with than making it interesting to watch . if this same story had been set in an american city , it would be hooted off the screen for its derivative narrative , stupid characters and limp action . all-too-common ground , as well . 
screenplay : mira nair and helena kriel . producers : mira nair and lydia dean pilcher . director : mira nair . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 119 minutes . it is a frequent lament of critics that movies today seem to be churned out on conveyor belts , each new release looking and sounding just like the one which preceded it . rare is the film to appear on american screens which shows audiences a completely different world , a world like the 16th century indian kingdom which is the setting for kama sutra : a tale of love . in this case , however , i think i understand _why_ we have never seen this world before : apparently , it was the cradle of monotony . kama sutra is a ridiculously tedious study of indian power politics in which writer/director mira nair manages to take exotic locations , torture and plenty of sex and weave them into an uninvolving bore . for about ten minutes , the glorious production design of mark friedberg and the cinematography of declan quinn might allow you to forgive the plodding pace . relish those minutes as you would relish water in the desert . kama sutra rolls along like a block of granite , moving from scene to scene with a wearying lack of grace . nearly every character is one-dimensional , and that one dimension tends to be sullen and unlikeable ; indira varma at least has a certain fresh appeal , but the script turns her into a disney cartoon heroine trying to find something more from life ( though i don't imagine uncle walt would approve of that " something " being life in a harem ) . the relationships and conflicts between the characters don't provide much more worth caring about , displaying the kind of melodrama which would make aaron spelling blush . as kama sutra wanders into its second hour , you may find yourself at your watch every five minutes and feeling as though it were moving backwards . you'd think that a film named after an ancient book of sexual wisdom at least might generate some heat , and unfortunately you would be sadly mistaken . there is a fair amount of skin in kama sutra , and a few lengthy sex scenes , but without any real passion or connection developed between the characters nair's direction makes those scenes look like the soft-core porn of a playboy instructional video . even those scenes don't make sex seem as abstract and impersonal as the occasional snippets of kama sutran erotic philosophy dispensed by rasa devi . in this country , rasa devi holds forth on the mystical nature of sexuality like a cross between dr . ruth and yoda , except slightly taller . if someone from another culture were to learn from kama sutra , it is that a droning lecture on sex can be just as soporific as a droning lecture on any other subject . the most distressing thing about kama sutra is what a conventional story it turns out to be , its unique setting notwithstanding . peel away the fuzzy-focus scenes of toe kissing and back scratching and you have a predictable romantic four-some complicated by class , like a jane austen novel with saris . nair and co-scripter helena kriel seem so desperate to make kama sutra seem like a metaphor for something that they toss in a military sub-plot about intrigue to overthrow raj singh which gives the film an overtone of richard iii ; there is even a hunchback prince as a particular reminder . it's still not nearly enough to make kama sutra worth two hours of your life , even with the opportunity in the final moments to see a man executed by being stepped on by an elephant . if this is what passes for showing us new worlds in the movies , sign me up for another year of national geographic . 
screenplay : winnie holzman . producers : penney finkelman cox , tom rosenberg , alan poul . director : scott winant . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 110 minutes . as the opening minutes of 'til there was you unfolded , i was fully prepared to despise it for continuing the sleepless in seattle-ization of the romantic comedy genre . the success of nora ephron's 1993 paean to celestially-destined love may be the worst thing ever to happen to film romance -- what incentive is there to create a plot or characters which make sense if you can explain everything away as " fate ? " then it became clear that 'til there was you wasn't falling into the sleepless trap . in fact , it was consciously subverting it . and suddenly i was even more depressed that the film i was watching was so painfully tedious . here was the love story i had been waiting for , and it turned out to be an uninvolving , maudlin and incoherent mess . i'm sure that director scott winant and writer winnie holzman thought they were on to something fairly clever when they came up to the concept for 'til there was you , and in theory they were right . it's a wonderfully practical kind of romanticism 'til there was you offers : the idea that true love is the product of two people who meet at a moment when they are both _ready_ for true love . that's the sturdy skeleton of the story , however , not the dead body of a film which was made with it . 'til there was you is all the things the detractors of those shows most detested , without nearly enough of the balancing wit and attention to detail which gave the shows such a devoted following . the two hours of 'til there was you could inspire a lot of watch-checking as it becomes a rambling parade of over-wrought situations and annoying characters , with gwen's picturesque apartment complex -- a cross between melrose place and the garden district where it is perpetually raining rose petals -- becoming more of a recurring joke than a location . the fatal flaw comes with the casting of the romantic leads , and for once the problem isn't that they don't belong together . you're just not likely to care one way or the other . jeanne tripplehorn demonstrates a nice flair for light comedy , but the pleasant-if-kooky character she plays isn't nearly interesting enough to support the story . nick is a complete blank for most of the film , and his sudden conversion from sullen architectural dadaist to lover of all things poetic and ornate makes virtually no sense . thank heaven sarah jessica parker is on hand as the endearingly narcissistic francesca , providing a burst of energy whenever she's in a scene . 'til there was you needs much more of that energy to match its good intentions , instead of 110 minutes of nearly oppressive sincerity . the struggles of real-life relationships don't have to be this dreary , but when they are , the appeal of starry-eyed hokum like sleepless in seattle suddenly makes a lot more sense . 
screenplay : daniel taplitz . director : daniel taplitz . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , sexual situations ) running time : 87 minutes . i wish more films would take on issues of faith and morality in the modern world . and i wish that film-makers would use commandments as a blueprint on how _not_ to do it . taplitz isn't interested in treating seth's tragedies as genuinely tragic , making it impossible to sympathize with him . composer joseph vitarelli provides a score full of whimsical woodwinds , turning seth's sacrilegious mission into an amusing lark ; quinn's performance as seth is all wild-eyed fervor without any genuine pain . the result is a character whose actions feel less like the authentic responses of an anguished man than the machinations of a high-concept movie plot . it's not even entirely clear that commandments is about seth . only courteney cox strikes a note of reality in a solid performance ; she is sane center around which too equally troubled men revolve . by the time seth makes a singularly biblical reappearance late in the film , it has become clear that taplitz is aiming for a fantastical fable which makes no connection with real human experience . commandments is a bad comedy which could have been a decent drama if daniel taplitz had had the guts to take faith -- and the loss thereof -- at all seriously . 
the most depressing thing about ripe is that you can spot the core of emotional honesty buried beneath the layers of lurid melodrama and clunky symbolism . while male coming-of-age stories litter the film landscape like lost world ticket stubs on a multiplex floor , film-makers appear far more uncomfortable with tackling the sexual awakening of girls . writer/director ogrodinik opted to frame ripe as a sort of surreal cautionary tale , a kids-like warning on the perils of unsupervised youth . there is an absurdity to the things the girls get away with , from shoplifting to wandering through an ammunition shed , but that absurdity is probably part of ogrodnik's point . if anything , ripe may be a feature length public service message on the importance of sex education . it is here that the surrealism and metaphorical heavy-handedness squash ripe like a rotting pomegranate . do impressive work with extremely difficult material , but it is not enough to create characters which are written as types . nothing in ripe feels authentic ; it is a parade of numbingly obvious fore-shadowing and ridiculous situations which shift the emphasis from sensitive observation to spectacle . this shift lends an unnecessary sleaziness to scenes of masturbation and loss of virginity which might have been effective if the situations felt natural . the shock value and controversy of ripe may be good for box office , but they're bad for narrative truth . a less self-consciously " provocative " ripe could have been the kind of honest drama which a mother and daughter could share and learn from together . instead , this ripe will likely become more popular at the corner video store with middle-aged men in trenchcoats . 
nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama con air . if the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should . cage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim-witted and ridiculous , and that he's going to have to do something to keep himself entertained . and thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed-up version of raising arizona's h . i . mcdonnough . he got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock , and if there's one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner don simpson ) , it's that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production . the critical difference between the rock and con air is cage's performance . that sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self-awareness . audiences , too , should know what they're getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production . in fact , the marketing people are counting on it . no one who loathed the rock for its swear-grunt-blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air ; no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded . director simon west ( yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab's soda fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it's perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ; like insulin , con air does the work of a gland ) . what he doesn't deliver is a moment of suspense . a bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock's notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really , _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely . if either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension , they might have done something with con air's creepiest set-up . their tete-a-tete is eerie and menacing , providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains ( danny trejo , ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them ) . in fact , con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- too many characters , too much editing , too many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts . it is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance . there's a word for people like you , nicolas . offender . 
squat little extraterrestrial with a telescoping neck . well , actually , it's a golden retriever named buddy . from the trailers and promotions for air bud , you might be expecting a rambunctious sports comedy about a bad-team-made-good in the recent disney tradition , with a hoops-playing pooch leading a basketball team to victory -- sort of the mighty dogs . with a few token exceptions , it's nothing of the kind . screenwriters paul tamasy and aaron mendelsohn want air bud to be a touching story of a lonely boy and his dog , something warm but slow-paced , something decidedly _not_ the mighty dogs . given the formulaic drivel disney usually passes off as live action entertainment , that noble goal alone should have made air bud worth supporting . young kevin zegers is a decent enough actor , but he's fighting against some tough precedents when he tries to make his friendship with buddy uniquely compelling , as well as fighting against charles martin smith's languid direction . the second mistake is purely the fault of disney's marketing department , which will be luring unsuspecting kids and their parents to what they believe is going to be a slapstick comedy . buddy's impressive basketball tricks might make a nice five-minute visit with letterman or leno , but they're not the stuff a feature film is made of . with the exception of one minor chase scene and the big basketball game finale ( which features the ridiculous fiction -- and anyone who has ever been to a middle school basketball game will realize this -- of a middle school basketball game with a score in the 80s and a team which runs a pivot game reminiscent of medowlark lemon-era globetrotters ) , air bud is achingly slow . twice as many children in the screening audience were roaming the aisles as were enraptured by the less-than-antic antics of josh and buddy . it's tough to knock a family film which dares to avoid bodily function humor , but air bud simply has no focus or direction , a fact made abundantly clear when the ridiculous basketball game finale gives way to an even more ridiculous courtroom finale . air bud is really deserving of praise for only one reason : it's not what it's being sold as . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : philip eisner . producers : jeremy bolt , lawrence gordon and lloyd levin . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , gore , adult themes , brief nudity ) running time : 95 minutes . give this to the makers of event horizon : as wholesale rip-offs of alien go , this one is remarkably thorough . in that sense , the malevolent entity a bit more efficient than the predatory stowaway of alien -- instead of tearing out your organs , it makes you want to tear them out yourself , or tear out those of your fellow crew members . event horizon , on the other hand , is not nearly so efficient . alien grabbed its viewers with one graphic , horrific moment and a whole lot of creepy atmosphers ; event horizon counters with a little creepy atmosphere and a whole lot of graphic , horrific moments . not a single violent image is left to the imagination , not when special effects can render a character coughing up blood in zero gravity , or a body ripped open and hung like a side of beef . there are certainly a few scares in event horizon , but director paul anderson ( mortal kombat ) rarely earns them . give me a roll of film , a dark room , a scary mask and a burst of dissonant strings , and even i could get an audience to jump every time . event horizon doesn't build a sense of dread , because it's easier to settle for shock and disgust . the truly disappointing thing about philip eisner's script is that , for a while , it looks like it's headed somewhere interesting . the idea of characters defeated by their own demons is infinitely more compelling than characters defeated by real demons , which gives event hroizon a creepy tension while there's still some mystery about what's going on . even when he does follow up on a character's motivations , they end up making very little sense . weir's motivations in particular -- which initially seem perfectly logical -- disintegrate near the film's climax , right about the time event horizon becomes a parade of explosions , slow-motion and lovingly photographed corpses . event horizon boasts some genuinely impressive technical credits , including imaginative production design by joseph bennett , but that doesn't explain what a cast this talented saw in this project . alien was the kind of memorable film which launched careers . event horizon is the kind of re-cycled nonsense which can end careers . remember , in space , no one can hear you scream , but in a movie theater , you can hear everyone groan . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " .

screenplay : bruce feirstein . director : roger spottiswoode . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , violence , profanity , sexual situations ) running time : 125 minutes . and in a strange way , she also points out its most glaring weaknesses . you see , bond may be a brand name , but as i noted in my 1995 review of goldeneye , the franchise no longer has the market cornered on high-flying , globe-hopping action . when the alternatives to the latest bond adventure include watching the dazzling jackie chan battle international espionage with considerably more imagination , tomorrow never dies starts to look rather bland and uninspired . the presence of yeoh , chan's capable sidekick in supercop , only serves as a reminder that there are new kids on the block . brosnan may look appropriately dapper , but the series just looks old , cruising on its place in cinematic history . the premise has a kind of perfunctory bond-ian grandiosity about it , despite an extremely lackluster villain . really , he does ) fall flat , but that's no great surprise . the real disappointment is the quality of the action set pieces -- a few flashes of creativity chaotically directed by roger spottiswoode ( air america , turner and hooch ) to lend the illusion of real energy . even peppering the action with traditional bond quips doesn't help , especially when most of the audience is baffled into silence by a reference to carver's " edifice complex . " the only real change of pace is yeoh , who provides the bond series with its best , most exciting leading lady in years ( with all due respect to maud adams and grace jones ) . she's such a match for bond -- just as resourceful and even more physically capable -- that it's a shame to see her reduced to damsel-in-distress status . watching yeoh fly through an acrobatic martial arts fight sequence conjures images of the more inventive stunt wizardry of jackie chan's films . chan has been out-bonding bond for years now , a detail it's hard to overlook while tomorrow never dies is punching and exploding its way through two hours on automatic pilot . pierce brosnan once again provides bond with an appropriate ruthlessness , but he's also burdened with the anachronistic he-man antics . much of the continued appeal of the series can be attributed to the fact that the more things change , the more james bond remains the same -- in the liberated , safe-sex , designated driver 90s , he's still an unabashed chauvinist who sleeps around , drinks his vodka martinis and kicks ass for queen and country . that sense of familiarity may be the series' greatest financial strength , but it's also its greatest impediment to quality . it's a film content to offer " do you remember this ?

there may not be a critic alive who harbors as much affection for shlock monster movies as i do . i delighted in the sneaky-smart entertainment of ron underwood's big-underground-worm yarn tremors ; i even giggled at last year's critically-savaged big-underwater-snake yarn anaconda . something about these films causes me to lower my inhibitions and return to the saturday afternoons of my youth , spent in the company of ghidrah , the creature from the black lagoon and the blob . deep rising , a big-undersea-serpent yarn , doesn't quite pass the test . sure enough , all the modern monster movie ingredients are in place : a conspicuously multi-ethnic/multi-national collection of bait . . . excuse me , characters ; an isolated location , here a derelict cruise ship in the south china sea ; some comic relief ; a few cgi-enhanced gross-outs ; and at least one big explosion . as it happens , deep rising is noteworthy primarily for the mechanical manner in which it spits out all those ingredients . it's hard to work up much enthusiasm for this sort of joyless film-making , especially when a monster moview should make you laugh every time it makes you scream . here , the laughs are provided almost entirely by kevin j . o'connor , generally amusing as the crew's fraidy-cat mechanic . writer/director stephen sommers seems most concerned with creating a tone of action-horror menace -- something over-populated with gore-drenched skeletons , something where the gunfire and special effects are taken a bit too seriously . deep rising is missing that one unmistakable cue that we're expected to have a ridiculous good time , not hide our eyes . case it point , comparing deep rising to its recent cousin anaconda . he shrieks in horror at his freakish appearance and pain , in a moment a bit too disturbing to be laughable . in anaconda , we also see a regurgitated victim , partially digested and still alive . he looks at another character . . . and winks . make no mistake , deep rising has anaconda beat all to heck when it comes to technical proficiency and pacing . it's also gloomy , uninspired and not nearly enough fun . i don't ask much of my monster movies , but i do ask that they act like monster movies . you don't have to show me a fantastically impressive , massive beast with tentacles a-flailing . just show me the massive beast burping , and i'll figure you get the point . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
" i've always wanted to be in films , " says dancer/choreographer pablo veron at one point in the tango lesson , to which writer/director sally potter replies " i've always wanted to be a dancer . " well , both get their chance in a grating feature-length self-indulgence disguised as a fanciful romance . somewhere buried in this collection of dance sequences are a few meditations on one's calling in life , the need to surrender control and the connections between various art forms . more power to you if you manage to exhume them . the tango lesson carries no emotional pull , since both lead performers have the seasoned acting chops of . . . well , a director and a dancer . some of the dance sequences are impressive , particularly veron's solo tap number in a kitchen , but the portentous and pretentious flow of the narrative robs them of all joy -- imagine gene kelly directed by fellini , and you'll understand why the tango lesson is such a bizarre experience . robby muller's typically impressive black-and-white cinematography only emphasizes that the film is an empty visual exercise , a project so personal it can only leave the audience wondering why in the world it should care . potter's spin on fellini's 8-1/2 is merely a moderately depressing record of the film-maker's mid-life crisis , in which she attempts to assure the world that she could too be a ballerina if she really wanted to . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
mpaa rating : r ( nudity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 95 minutes . a little over an hour into dark city , three of the film's central characters sit in a small boat , rowing slowly through a canal . sutherland prattles on with his plot summary for around five minutes , his wheezing , mannered peter lorre-meets-the elephant man delivery growing more insufferable by the moment , his character rapidly becoming something akin to austin powers' sir basil exposition . it's the sort of lazy , aggravating scene which is all too common in science-fiction/fantasy films , but in dark city it's even more aggravating . you see , sutherland's interminable synopsis consists of three distinct sub-categories : 1 ) stuff already explicitly stated in the equally lazy opening narration ; 2 ) stuff which should have been painfully easy to show rather than tell ; 3 ) stuff a viewer should have been able to figure out by actually watching the preceding hour instead of waiting for someone to give him the gist of it . and therein one can spot why it's a bad idea to take a dark existential thriller and pitch it at 15-year-olds . director and co-writer alex proyas ( the crow ) begins with several intriguing ideas -- the nature of identity , love as present experience versus collected experience , modern paranoia about loss of control -- but he seems so afraid of losing his audience that he keeps slowing down to allow the stragglers to catch up . every time dark city begins building towards a sense of mystery or menace , a convenient , prosaic bit of dialogue breaks the spell to start spelling everything out . i can't even work up much enthusiasm for the look of dark city , with its pale , bald antagonists and a few morphing twists added to the bleak-chic cityscapes of modern science-fantasy . despite its brief flirtations with profound philosophical questions , it's really just another good-looking vessel in which a cast of second-tier stars ( sutherland , jennifer connelly ) and slumming " serious actors " ( sewell , richardson , hurt ) is asked to rattle around for 90 minutes until the special effects budget runs out . it didn't necessarily have to be like that , not with a provocative premise as promising as that of blade runner . it simply takes guts to let a premise like that play itself out , the kind of guts studio executives generally don't have . i wouldn't be surprised to find out that word came down to proyas to compromise his vision , to create something virtually impossible to walk out of saying " i don't get it . " that kind of story-telling buys you long , slow boat rides down a cinematic canal , where explorations of a shattered human mindscape give way to the pointless tour-guide ramblings of sir kiefer exposition . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
some scattered thoughts on kissing a fool , a film too aggressively mediocre to permit much more : . . . memo to david schwimmer and jason lee : it's nice to see that you wanted to stretch a bit and try change-of-pace roles . that is assuming you are willing to suspend your disbelief from the rafters long enough to buy the puppy-dog schwimmer as an irresistable sex machine , or lee ( the abrasive banky in chasing amy ) as mr . nice guy . schwimmer's rendition of machismo consists of using a certain four-letter explitive around forty times , while lee seems to be comfortable only when he's yelling at somebody ( though he can be very funny when he is yelling at somebody ) . hunt , who plays jay's publisher and narrates the film in flashback , is simply one of the funniest women in any medium , bringing life to otherwise lifeless films like only you or jumanji . in kissing a fool , i kept waiting for the action to switch back to hunt telling the tale to a couple of annoying party guests , where her unmatched reaction shots could provide all the zing the script lacked . sadly , no one seems willing to give hunt a chance to carry a film , which means she's generally relegated to mop-up duty in supporting roles . until we all rise up and demand a better showcase for this wonderful performer , we'll all have to sit through films like kissing a fool in order to see her . . . . memo to screenwriters of mainstream romantic comedies : enough with the coy pretext that everyone in the audience doesn't know exactly how the story is going to end . the flashback framing structure of kissing a fool teases us by not showing us the groom to whom samantha is getting married , but i mean _really_ . the set-up is so transparently headed in one direction that it's insulting to suggest that anyone would guess incorrectly , not to mention the small fact that hunt's character makes it explicitly clear with one comment . news flash : romance is about _chemistry_ . how about giving us the faintest clue who samantha ( the appealing israeli actress avital ) really is ? how about a couple more scenes between her and , oh , i don't know , anybody ? if you judged strictly on the basis of shared scenes , you might think kissing a fool was a romance between schwimmer and lee ( shades of chasing amy , anyone ? ) . . . . memo to self : take a deep breath and wash kissing a fool right out of your head . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : randall wallace , based on the novel by alexandre dumas . producers : randall wallace and russell smith . director : randall wallace . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , sexual situations , violence ) running time : 124 minutes . it is the moment most of the audience -- the non-teenage-female , dicaprio-swooning portion -- has been waiting for . it is a moment guaranteed to inspire pseudo-spontaneous applause and whoops of approval . . . assuming the audience hasn't drifted into a heavy slumber . for around 100 minutes , randall wallace's rendition of the man in the iron mask wanders through attractive sets in search of a consistent tone , thematic coherence or even a real point . is it a lavish , lusty period romp in the spirit of richard lester's 1970s musketeers films ? is it a moody dickensian pot-boiler of a mysterious parentage and uncertain motivations ? is it a showcase for tiger beat poster-boy-du-jour dicaprio ? wallace effectively combined vengeance , romance and adventure in his script for braveheart , but in his first film behind the camera he never seems clear how to unite all the elements he introduces . the man in the iron mask sputters and hesitates like the work of a nervous rookie who just keeps throwing stuff at the screen in the vain hope that , eventually , something's gotta stick . the uninvolving and ponderous first hour and a half leaves a viewer plenty of time to scratch at minor annoyances until they become major annoyances . meticulously smudged rabble rouse themselves for a minor riot for exactly one scene , perhaps to distract momentarily from the impression that this is an epic with a cast of tens . half the cast speaks with french accents ( all genuine , courtesy depardieu , anne parillaud and plasticine ingenue judith godreche ) , while the other half appears to have wandered in from malibu , or london , or dublin . given the chance to bite into louis xiv's nastiness with relish , dicaprio instead gives him a tiresome method twist which suggests he just wants to be loved . all might have been forgiven if only wallace had played the musketeer trump card for all it was worth . he's got viewers right where he wants them with such iconic characters at his disposal ; the good will is as palpable as it is at a james bond film , where the mere utterance of a trademark phrase generates a ripple of excitement . there's just no good excuse to waste that kind of good will on one or two rounds of lackluster swordplay . dumas wrote wonderful pulp ; wallace tries to turn that pulp into something it's not , only he's not exactly sure what that is . the man in the iron mask is a big muddled mess of an adventure yarn , satisfying only for those interested in going to watch dicaprio in regal finery looking his prettiest . others will find a waste of stellar cast and classic story which never gets a handle on what the film should have been about for the average viewer : a chance to cheer for the crossed swords of re-born legends just a bit earlier than 100 minutes after the lights go down . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
director : nicholas hytner . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 110 minutes . as i sat watching the object of my affection , all i could think was : here is a romantic comedy for everyone who applauded when my best friend's wedding ended with julia roberts dancing with ruppert everett . i'm not about to delve into the sociology or psychology of friendships between women and gay male pals , but apparently it has achieved a status as part of the urban american zeitgeist . still . . . a mainstream romantic comedy about two people whose primary similarity is that they're both attracted to men ? i have to give the object of my affection credit for tackling the subject at all . i just can't give it much credit for tackling the subject effectively . there is no character there , nothing which gives us clue why she does what she does , or what it is in her life that makes george such an appealing alternative to vince . though rudd fills in a few blanks with a pleasant , appropriately confused performance -- working wonders with the well-handled moment in which he actually responds to nina's physical attentions -- george and nina's friendship never feels genuine . it's just a plot device set up so two attractive people can get into wacky and farcical situations . actually , not all that wacky and farcical at all , as it turns out . between nicholas hytner's direction and wendy wasserstein's script , the object of my affection almost never feels like a comedy . the story is too serious by half , full of tearful or angry confrontations and sincere speeches , with the pregnancy sub-plot a terribly ill-advised decision . hytner , meanwhile , can never create a consistent comic rhythm to buoy the narrative . every edit feels jarring , slamming scenes one into the other rather than letting them build to humorous high points . wasserstein metes out the giggles between the most gratuitous uses of the " f " -word since the last romantic comedy starring a " friends " cast member ( kissing a fool ) , with everyone involved taking the issues too seriously to bother making them funny . all the emphasis on longing and misapplied affection at least provides a nice role for nigel hawthorne , who worked with hytner on the madness of king george . yet even that bright spot further emphasizes the object of my affection as a romantic comedy which isn't particularly romantic or particulalry comedic . it's really a half-hearted stab at teasing the same social conventions chasing amy successfully trampled all over . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin . director : mimi leder . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , intense scenes ) running time : 115 minutes . if ever a film begged -- nay _pleaded_ -- to be a mini-series , that film is deep impact . that's enough flashing to give you the disorienting sensation of sitting through a cinematic strobe light . deep impact wants to be a heroic disaster epic , examining the effect of impending devastation on individual people and their relationships , but that can only happen if we get to know the characters a little . every one of deep impact's sub-plots feels forced into a chunk of time far too small to do it justice . in fact , it often seems as though every bit of character interaction has been edited out of deep impact except the tear-filled separations and reunions , leaving little more than a hollow succession of musical cues . that may not be a tremendous surprise when you're dealing with a big-budget disaster film . what should come as a surprise is deep impact's disappointing lack of visual energy . this is one sedate blockbuster , offering one invigorating set piece of the messiah mission before settling into a dull march towards five minutes of destruction . every other opportunity to dazzle is either turned into exposition or ignored entirely . we never even get to see the massive underground ark after a huge narrative build-up . deep impact is so bereft of spectacle and detail that it's never possible to grasp the immensity of the impending tragedy , or watch a year of mounting dread unfold . in fact , i can't imagine a more absurdly optimistic portrayal of human reaction to the coming apocalypse , with the isolated traffic jam and a few fires being the only intrusion on a general response of beatific acceptance . it may be the end of the world as they know it , but they feel fine . deep impact boasts such a talented cast -- duvall , freeman , redgrave , schell , charles martin smith , james cromwell -- that occasionally it feels weightier than the script deserves . mimi leder's direction also offers a few effective moments , including a montage of reaction shots which provides more insight than all the dialogue combined . most of the time , however , deep impact feels like six hours of raw footage hacked to ribbons to meet the imperatives of feature film length . it's not exactly a bad film ; it's just about one-third of an acceptably engrossing one . if you want to do justice to an extinction level event , you need the 366 minutes of 1994's television adaptation of stephen king's the stand . deep impact's 115 minutes manage to turn a comet strike into a moderate inconvenience . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
i envy forest whitaker , because he's one man who doesn't have to hear that accusation most men hear when it comes to " women's films " : that he " just doesn't get it . " i'm sure someone somewhere will accuse me of " just not getting " hope floats . what i really didn't get was how whitaker could take a fairly simple story and make it so ragged and unfocused . hope floats might have worked if it had explored its unique premise for all its dramatic and comedic possibilities . surrounding an emotionally wounded housewife with people who knew her as a teen beauty queen -- and who most likely harbor a secret delight at her failure -- would be a fascinating way to to watch her grow up and come to terms with the unreasonable expectations of her youth . instead , hope floats relegates that context to a few isolates snippets , opting instead to focus on plastic relationship dynamics . harry connick jr . plays the role of the nice guy with such obvious puppy dog likeabilty that there's never a moment's tension in the romance between him and bullock . the mother-daughter relationship between bullock and rowlands is similarly tepid , despite a pleasant performance by rowlands in the role of conspicuous eccentric ( she practices home taxidermy ) . the film never feels like anyone knows exactly where it should go , what we should be learning about birdee , and why her story should matter to us at all . part of the problem -- perhaps a very large part -- is the casting of bullock in the lead role . bullock is a charming actress with a killer smile , but she doesn't appear to have the faintest idea how to play this character . so what she does is smile , and smile constantly , in every possible context to display every possible emotion . it makes a certain sense that the one-time miss congeniality would be an inveterate smiler , but her smile is used as substitute for characterization , as though it won't matter that we don't understand her at all as long as we find her so darned nice . this generally scattered approach to the material carries through whitaker's direction -- in cross-cutting which blunts emotional impact , in abrupt changes of focus , in an over-dependence on caleb deschanel's silky cinematography . their story -- the story of how absentee parents affect children's lives -- is infinitely more involving than birdee's rather mundane and inevitable trip to " finding herself " ( i . e . sure there are a few sniffles and chuckles along the way , but nothing nearly as potent as bernice howling in pain as her father leaves her behind . maybe forest whitaker will end up demonstrating a knack for " getting " the stories of children . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : michael browning . producers : ivan reitman , wallis nicita , roger birnbaum . director : ivan reitman . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity , violence ) running time : 101 minutes . all right , let's get this out of the way : anne heche is a lesbian . coverage of six days , seven nights has focused so heavily on this point -- and on the corollary question of whether heche would be " credible " as a heterosexual romantic interest -- that you might suspect the title had been changed officially to six days , seven nights with lesbian anne heche playing a heterosexual . never mind that audiences didn't seem to have a problem finding heterosexual actor tom hanks " credible " as a gay man in philadelphia . never mind that presumably no one would have a problem finding a different 28-year-old woman " credible " as the romantic interest of 55-year-old harrison ford . and never mind that most hollywood scripts consider a " credible " romance to be any pairing of actors of the opposite sex , character development be hanged . six days , seven nights is an unsatisfying hollywood trifle , not because heche doesn't date men , but because the script is a disaster . naturally , quinn and robin are polar opposites who share an almost instant antagonism . it's one of filmdom's most enduring set-ups , but there's one rather important thing missing from this version : the faintest understanding of robin's motivation for getting involved with quinn . it's not chemistry that's missing in the relationship between robin and quinn -- it's sympathy . in a valiant attempt to distract the audience from focusing on the characters' deficiencies , browning and director ivan reitman amp up the action quotient by pitting our protagonists against pirates . yes , that's right , pirates . for a film desperately in need of more character development , six days , seven nights wastes valuable minutes on a ridiculous forced conflict which contributes nothing to the story but one gag from heche : " you mean 'arrrghh' pirates ? " six days , seven nights actually contains a few amusing gags , with both heche and ford -- long under-appreciated for his comic timing -- scoring some comic hits . they just have almost nothing to work with , squirming around with absurd situations and stick-figure characters . the film's few simple pleasures , including the lovely kauai scenery , are lost in the search for some reason to root for these people ending up together . the fact that there's nothing " credible " about the pairing of robin and quinn has nothing to do with anne heche's choice of real-life romantic partners . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
even the name before the film has changed , with disney shuttling the sequel from its flagship banner to dimension , the genre division of miramax ( apparently realizing the original had too few fart jokes to qualify as a live-action disney film ) . i only wish that with all those changes they could have rustled up a new screenwriting team . naturally this leads to amusing sequences of buddy befuddling opposing defenses as he makes like jerry rice . but wait , there's more ! the original air bud had good intentions and solid family values to spare , but it tied them up in such derivative and unfocused package that even the kids in the audience couldn't keep their attention on the precocious pooch . new director richard martin picks up the pace considerably this time around , but he can't do much to create any cohesiveness with this story . from moment to moment , it's hard to tell whether air bud : golden receiver is supposed to be an afterschool special , a john hughes film or an episode of rocky and bullwinkle ( though with considerably less wit ) . it's also hard to take seriously a film where a premise so bizarre is shrugged off as a given . this time around , buddy trots onto the field in his leather helmet and shoulder pads as though it were the most natural thing in the world . perhaps somewhere on the cutting room floor is a scene in which an arbitrator cites the " air bud " precedent . without such a scene , everything that follows seems a little insulting to the intelligence , and an indication of how lazy the screenwriters were that they couldn't come up with some creative way to land buddy on the team . i'm not pretending that air bud : golden receiver was made with me in mind . this one is a short attention span kiddie-caper which did have the young ones clapping and guffawing with some regularity , and perhaps that counts for something . it even features a few decent throwaway gags , including a llama named dolly and a splendidly off-key rendition of the american national anthem . there's just something vaguely desperate about this whole air bud franchise -- they have build not just one film but a series of them on what amounts to a better-than-average stupid pet trick . sure , it's harmless enough , but the frantic amalgamation of disparate elements gave me a headache . it's a bit frightening to note that the original buddy's trainer kevin dicicco is putting together another project , air bud : the next generation . perhaps in the course of teaching a new dog a new trick , he could teach a new screenwriting team one i'd really love to see : how to write a script that might appeal to someone over the age of five . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , adult themes , nudity ) running time : 121 minutes . adding delilah to the mix certainly adds some spice to the second-chance romance story line , particularly with goldberg in the role . sure , goldberg is doing little more than an extended funky-sassy miss thang riff , but she's always fun to watch , timing her salacious or sarcastic comments impeccably . instead of the novel's hyper-introspective first person narrative , stella on screen offers a bit more interplay , and a bit more fun . so much for the short-term benefit . as talented and forceful an actor as angela bassett can be , she plays stella with too much exuberant confidence . delilah's influence is pervasive as the relationship blossoms ; the bump-n-grind stella we see in jamaica appears to have far too much groove still in her to need getting any of it back . the combination of unfocused motivations and little comic relief proves fatal in the film's final 45 minutes , when it becomes a genuine butt-numbing ordeal . the story simply has nowhere left to go but around in circles : there's some relationship talk , a bit of romance , tense moments , and more relationship talk , all of it surrounding a relationship with not nearly enough chemistry to be involving . newcomer taye diggs , doing a barely serviceable jamaican accent , has all the boyish charm the role needs with about a tenth of the mature-beyond-his-years wisdom it requires . that leaves a whole lot of grating will-they-or-won't-they vacillation over a pairing that , on screen , doesn't make much sense . bass and mcmillan seemed to realize that the very internalized nature of how stella got her groove back required something different to work as a film . the big change they made had it heading in the right direction , but it only emphasized how truly un-cinematic the rest of the story could be . whoopi goldberg may chew up the lovely island scenery , but at least she presents something worth holding your attention for an hour or so . she also makes the rest of the film look like it's about a different kind of groove : the run-out groove . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
mike myers transforms himself in 54 , in virtually every way a performer can transform himself . in his first truly dramatic screen performance , myers is still recognizable with his open-mouthed little boy grin , but here he uses it to create an overgrown little boy convinced he can only find friends by throwing the coolest party . rubell is a fascinating character , performed by myers with a mix of savvy , pathos and self-absorption . if writer/director mark christopher had had the common sense to make 54 the story of steve rubell , he might have created a great film . 54's base-line narrative is so trite it almost plays like a parody , a disco-era goof on midnight cowboy or some far less seminal corruption of the innocent melodrama . perhaps it was his idea of irony : like studio 54 itself , his movie invites people in so they can stand around and be attractive . the plotting and pacing are so relentlessly predictable that the film doesn't even work well as a sociology lesson . shane's voice-over narration dutifully informs us why studio 54 was so unique and popular , but there's never enough energy for us to believe him or care . 54 spends 91 minutes pointing off-handedly at this or that detail like a bored tour guide . for a film that includes money-laundering , ripping off the mob , sex , drugs , celebrities and plenty of boogie oogie oogie-ing , it almost never gets the pulse racing . the notable exceptions are the scenes involving myers as rubell . sure , the character isn't perfectly realized ; in fact , it probably seems better simply because it's surrounded by so much uninspired junk . it's also amusing watching him tell a talk show host " the road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom " after we've seen him lying in a pile of money , drooling vomit . there's a great story in that unhappy collection of contradictions , but you won't find it amidst the smothering cliches of mark christopher's script . with all the stranger-than-fiction truth at his disposal , he somehow found the least interesting approach possible . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
for what it's worth , matt healy's script for clay pigeons is remarkably unpredictable as film scripts go . big-city shelby doesn't by clay's folksy protestations of innocence , leading to culture clash . is it a serial killer thriller , a dark comedy , or a tarantino-era spin on small-town stagnation -- the last picture show with stab wounds and copious use of a certain " f-word ? " i didn't mind not knowing from one moment to the next where clay pigeons might take me . i did mind that by the time i got where it was taking me , i didn't much care . joaquin phoenix brings his wounded , sensitive demeanor to clay , making him a sympathetic enough protagonist in spite of his flaws . director david dobkin , on the other hand , doesn't seem nearly as interested in investing us in clay's plight , or the hints that clay's learning something about himself through it all . just when he should be trying for some hook into the story -- whether emotional or comedic -- dobkin lets the narrative get progressively grimmer , chillier and more remote . it's a tic-and-flourish film in search of a solid center . it's a shame he couldn't have done more with an intriguing , eccentric cast . janeane garofolo tries to give her ironic observations on small-town ways some bite , but her character always seems to belong in a slightly different movie . a film that could have been a quirky original instead feels merely off-putting , as though the director is daring the audience to find something to enjoy . unpredictability can only carry a film so far ; clay pigeons makes you feel like a sucker for coming along for the ride . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
one of the things you've gotta love about hollywood marketing people is their occasional bouts with irony deficiency . if you trusted television advertisements for holy man , you'd probably suspect that it was a raucous eddie murphy comedy where the star spends most of the film mocking and deflating uptight media types . that's because touchstone pictures' marketing department knew it'd have one hellacious time trying to sell holy man for what it really is : a somber , sincere satire-cum-cautionary tale in which eddie murphy , despite his lead billing , generally plays second fiddle to jeff goldblum . the wonderful , awful irony comes from the " message " of holy man . goldblum plays ricky hayman , the programming director for miami-based good buy shopping network . as g's success reinvigorates ricky's career , ricky begins to wonder whether it's more important to be honest with people than to use any means available to sell to them . pretty good gag , huh ? only the joke will be on viewers who expect to have their funny bones tickled , but instead get a nearly two-hour lecture on the evils of consumerism . murphy , meanwhile , gets a few devilish moments of his own -- you know , the ones in the commercials -- but essentially spends the film's running time smiling beatifically and waxing profound on the importance of love and connection with the earth . it's all very well-intentioned , and deadly dull . the sad part is that holy man could have been an effective piece of satire . the script by tom schulman presents g as a latter-day howard beale or chance the gardener unknowingly tapping into some zeitgeist malaise . unfortunately , if you're going to go for network or being there-style stabs at modern media , you need someone a bit more cutting edge at the helm than stephen herek ( the mighty ducks , mr . herek wraps everything in a warm-n-fuzzy package guaranteed not to offend , a pointless perspective for a social satire . even the few token pokes at infomercialism , including cameo pitch-meisters like morgan fairchild , betty white and soupy sales , are too feather-light to amount to much . wasting a chance to savage as ripe a target as home shopping should be a criminal offense . it's similarly criminal wasting the presence of eddie murphy . i understand murphy's recent move toward kinder , gentler , family-friendly roles , since there are only so many ways to play the wise-cracking rebel with the honking laugh . the problem isn't his performance in holy man , which is quite adequate for the minimal work he's actually required to do . the problem is that no matter how hard murphy tries to be a " versatile actor , " he's going to be in trouble with audiences if marketing geniuses keep suckering his fans into watching a murphy they don't really care to see . i'm glad murphy felt strongly enough about holy man's message of integrity to take a chance playing against type , but he could have picked a less tedious vehicle . it's even worse when touchstone makes him look like a certain pot referring to a certain kettle's ebony shading . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
david webb peoples has contributed to some of the most compelling screenplays of recent years . peoples has shown a facility for turning genre films into films of ideas . the specific ideas with which he has concerned himself held out the hope that soldier might be something more than this week's disposable bit of whoop-it-up mayhem . i suspect that peoples's original script focused on how the functionally anti-social todd begins to explore human interaction for the first time . that's not the story director paul anderson insists on telling . though in his production notes anderson describes the story as " shane in outer space , " he actually makes it much more like rambo in outer space . the final half-hour generally finds todd picking off his faceless adversaries like red-shirts in a " star trek " episode , occasionally interrupted by immense explosions and flying bodies . never mind that caine is a programmed soldier just like todd himself , and that it would be much more interesting to sympathize with him than to cheer his inevitable defeat mindlessly . there's nothing inherently wrong with black hat/white hat action adventures where we watch a bit of carnage and root for good to triumph over evil . the problem is that anderson pretends soldier is more than that , offering scenes of todd perplexed by a tear rolling down his face , or recoiling at displays of kindness . moments that might have been genuinely affecting instead inspire derisive laughter , because anderson is far more interested in visceral response than in emotional response . ironically , he spends most of the film reveling in dehumanizing violence instead of showing how dehumanizing violence created his protagonist . i can't believe that's the story david webb peoples wanted to tell , which is what makes soldier more disappointing than it might otherwise be . he turned over a smart idea to a director determined to make a dumb movie . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : trey callaway . director : danny cannon . i still know what you did last summer seems like exactly the kind of film at which scream and scream 2 took their satiric jabs . shadowy figures flit across the background . aside from its chronologically-challenged title -- if this is happening a year after the first film , shouldn't it be i still know what you did two summers ago ? -- i still know shat you did last summer is constructed with an almost benign predictablity . yet in a way , that's the appeal of the teen horror film . there's nothing truly scary about the film , nor was there ever intended to be . it's a halloween funhouse with spaghetti for intestines and peeled grapes for human eyeballs . there's nothing dehumanizing about the way characters are gleefully dispatched , because they're never meant to be any more human than a mannequin being decapitated . you scream because it's what you're supposed to do , and you laugh about it afterwards . that doesn't make it any more fun for the average viewer of voting age to watch a film where you can identify every twist or turn several minutes before it happens . this is the kind of film you go to for only one reason : you're a teenager , you're on a date , and you're ready for an excuse to grip someone tightly . you're not going for the chance to see jeffrey combs' demented turn as a hotel manager with an attitude . you're not going to care about the inane attempts to give our protagonists actual personalities . you're certainly not going to care about the silly dialogue , or the less-than-terrifying prospect of julie becoming an ultraviolet mcnugget while locked into a tanning bed . you'll pay your money for a hug and a shriek , and you'll get exactly what you pay for . if i still know what you did last summer didn't feel as long as its title by the time the credits finally roll , it might have warranted even more slack . after all , it's a genre film doing what a genre film is made to do . it's also a film which feels blasted into production on a shaky premise with virtually no attempt at creating a quality product . it might seem strange to see a film like this after scream turned its kind into comic relief , but there's still an audience for this sort of grind-it-out funhouse ride . i'm not it , but you know who you are . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : woody allen . director : woody allen . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 113 minutes . woody allen's detractors have had a laundry list of gripes about his films for many years now . his neurotic screen persona had grown increasingly shrill and annoying , they said ; his cinematic world of white upper-manhattanites had grown ever more insular . as the lines between his convoluted personal life and his baldly autobiographical films grew blurrier by the year , the anti-woody contingent began to consider him a vaguely pathetic has-been , the film-making equivalent of frank sinatra -- more famous in the later stages of his career for who he used to be than for who he still was . it took watching kenneth branagh's grating gloss on allen's mannerisms in celebrity for me to sympathize with that side of the great woody debate . it's easy to see the potential in celebrity for exploring the foibles of fame and the absurdity of a culture that bestows fame for all the wrong reasons . unfortunately , lee is never a remotely sympathetic character , primarily because branagh is too preoccupied with mimicking the woodman to find anything true in the character . judy davis is more effective as the emotionally fragile robin , but her character arc is only slightly more compelling . the film's two central characters are contrivances ; worse , they're often annoying contrivances , twisted knots of self-doubt and self-loathing whose happiness couldn't matter less to us . without any emotional center , celebrity becomes a series of stand-alone vignettes about the strange and self-absorbed things famous people do . allen can still manage to pull out a few one-line zingers ( including self-deprecating takes on " pretentious film-makers who shoot everything in black-and-white " ) , but they're few and far between in this film . sequences that should build to a great comic payoff , like lee's wild night with dicaprio's bad boy actor , just seem to drag on until it's time to start the next scene . the lack of invention in celebrity gives you plenty of time to notice how stale allen's act has become . for every decent gag ( a film producer referring to his next project , " an all-black version of 'birth of a nation' " ) , there are half a dozen that turned up in a previous woody allen film . celebrity , a film which should have been wonderfully timely in the daytime talk show era , shows little cutting-edge satiric bite . perhaps it's even more ironic that he's showing himself to be one of those famous people so far removed from ordinary life that he doesn't know what we might find absurd , or that he himself may now be one of those people famous for all the wrong reasons . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : george miller , judy morris and mark lamprell . director : george miller . running time : 95 minutes . like a classic storybook tale , 1995's babe was set no-where and no-when in particular . the singular world in which the rosy , glowing hoggett farm and its chattering menagerie existed added to the charm that made the original film a surprise hit and an oscar-nominee . babe : pig in the city takes that anywhere-ness a step farther . . . actually , a step too far . it's a cute gag the first time , but it also signals a not-so-subtle shift in tone from babe . the setting is no longer anywhere , but everywhere ; the story isn't just a fantasy where anything could happen , but one where the film-makers try to make everything happen . babe : pig in the city is so full of plots and sub-plots that saving the hoggett farm practically becomes an afterthought , with a resolution so silly it almost seems a waste of time . you might suspect that a pace that frantic would be a sop to younger viewers , but it's hard to imagine george miller ( who produced the original and also directs here ) had kids in mind making this film . a catastrophic performance by a low-rent circus ( featuring mickey rooney in a weird cameo as a clown of indeterminate personality ) turns into a moody and murky slow-motion sequence like something out of platoon ; later , a dog with a bad heart has a near-death experience with pastoral visions . babe certainly had a few dark moments , but nothing like the consistently creepy feel of pig in the city . miller may have been playing to the kiddies when mrs . hoggett goes bouncing around a reception hall in inflatable pants , but not when a dog insults a cat with an epithet that could be interpreted as quite vulgar . ironically , that strangely mature tone introduces the film's only truly compelling element , a melancholy performing orangutan named thelonious ( voice of james cosmo ) . he's a mysterious presence who can't seem to bear the idea that he's not human , and both the animal and vocal performances are wonderfully sympathetic . i sat just a bit forward in my seat every time thelonious appeared , gradually realizing that this one character also served to point out how bland the rest of the characters are in babe : pig in the city . there are too many animals milling about to care about any of them all that much ; even the little pig himself seems to have been sapped of personality . the easy rapport between babe and farmer hoggett ( relegated here to little more than a glorified cameo ) is sorely missed . then again , a whole lot of things from babe are sorely missed . it's a nice change of pace to find a sequel that doesn't merely try to remake the original , but babe : pig in the city lack any of the original's endearing gentle spirit . it's so hyped-up and busy , it's almost as though john hughes got hold of our sweet little pig and tossed him into a home alone sequel . this is one major holiday disappointment , a storybook tale that should have quit with its original happy ending . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
about forty minutes into stepmom , i came to a numbing realization . . . well , two actually . the first was that i knew exactly where this domestic drama was headed and could predict scenes and confrontations far down the road . the second was that i knew we were still 90 minutes away from the closing credits . as the film ever-so-slowly unfolded , i began to realize what five credited screenwriters can buy you : perhaps the most inefficient screenplay of the year . there's some promising human drama in the premise , which begins with conflict in an extended family . that's an interesting enough twist on the complicated emotions and allegiances of extended family interactions , one that could have made a tidy feature weeper . unfortunately , absolutely nothing about stepmom could be called tidy . if a situation or relationship calls for a scene to establish it , stepmom provides two or three . stepmom appears to have no faith that we'll understand the significance of a character's actions unless those actions are underlined , making it both insulting and redundant . every turn of character is so deliberately structured , you might suspect that every subsequent screenwriter came in just to add another half dozen scenes , and no one threw anything out . stepmom's narrative unwieldiness also makes it extremely hard to connect with any of the many plot lines . ed harris , meanwhile , struggles just to find a few minutes of screen time . with all the complexities involved in these family dynamics , dear old dad remains a complete enigma . " you're a great dad , " jackie tells luke in once scene ; " i just never gave you the chance to realize it . " that sentiment will probably apply to the entire audience , which may forget there's a father anywhere to be found . for a film about getting your priorities straight , stepmom sure doesn't . of course , it's understood that this is to be a showcase for the two lead actresses , and we shouldn't begrudge them a showcase when lead actresses generally get the treatment harris gets here . roberts and sarandon are both quite good in their roles , sarandon in particular bringing a wonderful steely maternalism . they're just stuck in the kind of film which has become director chris columbus' specialty : cheap comic relief which gives way to big messages of understanding . stepmom is a big emotional mess of a movie , one which grows increasingly irritating as karaoke production numbers and one tearful goodbye after another chew up minutes of screen time . good actors deserve better than a script that -- strangely enough -- looks like pieces of the work of five different writers stitched together to form a movie . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : w . peter iliff . director : mike robbins . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , nudity , adult themes ) running time : 103 minutes . it would also be inaccurate -- religious faithful generally demonstrate some sense of proportion . a cult would be more analagous , with thousands of people connecting their happiness to the achievements of mere mortals to whom greater powers are ascribed . or perhaps rudimentary tribal warfare is more appropriate . or even basic psychological child abuse . or , varsity blues could be made . as the exceedingly pleasant van der beek plays him , there's never much question at all . he's a broad strokes hero like kilmer -- who's not only a martinet , but a racist just for good measure -- is a broad strokes villain . dramatically , mox is a flatline . that inconsequential plot progression wastes plenty of potentially compelling conflict . the emotional center of varsity blues should have been the pressure and twisted values that make high school kids believe nothing they ever do will be as valuable , a sentiment expressed in kilmer's pep talk that the big game is " 48 minutes for the next 48 years of your lives . " though director brian robbins ( making a dramatic leap from good burger ) nails the atmosphere of abandoned friday night streets , w . peter iliff's script uses it mostly as scenery for a typical teen soap opera . it's worth noting that robbins and ilif include at least a few insightful scenes -- including one player's rage against how much he's always hated the game -- between the obligatory t&a and party-hearty scenes . this isn't the last picture show we're talking about , nor was it ever likely to be , but it could have aimed for something slightly more ambitious than a climax where all that matters is whether the coyotes can win the big game . that's not just uninspired -- given the setting , it's painfully ironic . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 102 minutes . somehow , there's something even more icky about an exploitative and routine horror film that tarts up its exploitation and routineness with plenty of style . such is the case with neil jordan's in dreams , a psychological thriller which lets its atmospheric creepiness disintegrate into a trite chase-n-terrorize puree . for a while , it looks like in dreams is going to be a thriller of a different stripe , something as dramatically and visually compelling as it is viscerally shocking . the story takes claire on a descent into genuine madness , the kind that makes a character truly unpredictable and interesting to watch . partly it seems rushed , with scenes slammed together too quickly to develop the necessary foreboding . and partly it seems mean-spirited , using graphic murders for shock value or imperiled children for sympathy value , rather than building interest in the characters . over its final 45 minutes , in dreams begins a slow but steady descent from potent psychological thriller to careless mess . to be fair to downey , the role is a serial killer cliche -- he's a norman bates momma's boy with _serious_ gender role issues -- without a remotely sympathetic quality , dashing hopes of a mind-game showdown into the rocks . instead it's all guns and sharp objects , running and screaming , until a bleak , unsatisfying and confounding resolution . it's a huge disappointment coming from neil jordan , a film-maker who has consistently made films that defied expectations -- the company of wolves , the crying game , the butcher boy . in a sad way , that's exactly what he does here . just when you expect in dreams might turn out to be a memorably disturbing horror film , it turns out to be a gutless , nihilistic tease . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : peter tolan and harold ramis and kenneth lonergan . director : harold ramis . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 106 minutes . the very concept behind " high concept " comedy is that the premise sells itself . a potential viewer can see one poster or one 30-second commercial and understand instantly all the wacky comic possibilities : schwarzenegger and devito as twins , eddie murphy as the nutty professor , robin williams as an iconoclastic medical student . the reason so many " high concept " films are so mediocre is that no one bothers to do the other half of the work , leaving a situation comedy that's entirely situation . there was reason to hope for a bit more from analyze this , since director harold ramis also directed and co-wrote the decade's best high concept comedy , groundhog day . as a pitch , it probably sounded hilarious ; with deniro and crystal in the lead roles , it probably seemed like a can't-miss mismatched tandem . instead , analyze this is primarily a series of botched opportunities . the most glaring gaffe is the casting of crystal as sobol , though at first glance he might appear to be ideal for the uptight therapist . not only does this bit of character background prove utterly pointless in the long run , it emphasizes that ben could have been an interesting charcter if played by an actual actor . crystal simply can't avoid turning his every scene into shtick , making a classic deadpan straight-man part -- something perfect for , say , deniro's midnight run partner charles grodin -- into something silly and clownish . the remarkably talented lisa kudrow , though given third billing , is wasted in what amounts to the " girlfriend part " for a handful of scenes ; the rival gangster played by chazz palminteri , which should have provided a nice counterpoint to the frazzled vitti , barely registers as a character . perhaps most distracting is a constantly shifting tone that makes analyze this a candidate for its own multiple-therapy session . while scenes of slapstick and comic misunderstanding are colliding with violent shootouts and emotional breakdowns , there's never the feeling that ramis is aiming for an edgy , dark comedy -- it's just a high concept comedy into which other elements keep intruding . there's no narrative momentum to analyze this , no sense of character consequence to keep it from turning into a repetitive series of sketch comedy scenes . there's at least one thing really right with analyze this , and that's deniro . as many times as he's gone to the wiseguy well in his career -- mean streets , the godfather part ii , goodfellas , the untouchables , etc . -- he always seems to find a new twist to keep it fresh . it's fun watching him nod to his past when he comments on a godfather-inspired dream ben has , it's fun watching him work with the amusing joe viterelli as vitti's main muscele man , and it's fun watching him show the comic chops he too rarely has a chance to employ . unfortunately , he's wasting his performance on a movie that doesn't know what to do with its actors , its premise -- one-upped by the current hbo series " the sopranos " -- or its character development . analyze this is a smaller scale example of what happens to so many summer blockbusters : it's a ready-made marketing campaign to which a film has been attached almost as an afterthought . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
it's okay for a horror film to be a metaphor ; in fact , they can work best on an underlying psychological level . a scary film can be more than just scary , but it shouldn't work so hard at it that the whole thing becomes a pretentious , preposterous mess . ravenous is just such a convoluted concoction , throwing mountains of sub-text at its tale of cannibalism in the vain hope that something might stick , instead of merely " ick . " every once in a while , when ravenous settles down for some good old-fashioned terror tension , you can almost enjoy it . there are a few nicely staged confrontations and creepy moments in antonia bird's direction ( or perhaps that of milcho manchevski , the director replaced two weeks into production ) , including a sequence involving a sneak attack that builds far longer than you might think possible . writer ted griffin slips a few darkly comic lines into the dialogue , and robert carlyle's manic performance helps support that tone whenever he's on screen . how much more tolerable ravenous might have been if griffin and bird had been content to let the black comedy guide them . instead , it becomes a potpourri of narrative notions and random themes : the dehumanizing destruction of battle ( i . e . , war itself as cannibalism ) , the mad drive for the american frontier ( i . e . , the manifest destiny as cultural/ecological cannibalism ) , the equally mad drive for the gold in them thar hills ( i . e . , the gold rush as economic cannibalism ) , plus yet another gloss on addiction , and on and on to a dizzying degree , with the native american myth of the weendigo thrown in for good measure . boyd's tortured quandary over whether to join this particular diners' club is played as such grand opera , infused with such socio-political baggage , that guy pearce looks like he's carrying the entire weight of western civilization on his shoulders in every scene . no one's saying that the jaunty gruesomeness of eating raoul is the only possible approach for a successful foray into same-species snacking . it may , however , be the best approach . when jeffrey jones is cracking wise while supping on a human stew , ravenous begins to emerge from its coma of self-importance ; when he pleads to be relieved of the misery of his hunger , you wonder when he suddenly developed a character of any significance . at a certain point , ravenous becomes so consumed with putting a heady spin on its subject matter that it consumes itself . a horror film with something to say between shocks is fine . it's rare -- and annoying -- to find one that just won't shut up . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : abby kohn & marc silverstein . director : raja gosnell . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity , drug use ) running time : 104 minutes . i'm willing to forgive never been kissed many of its failings because , for all practical purposes , it's a fantasy . i can over look the irony of a film about an adult returning to interact with teenagers which portray teens the same inane way adults usually think of them . i can let it slide that the tone is terminally bubbly when a touch of venom might have helped . i can even shrug my shoulders at the notion that drew barrymore was ever a spat-upon teen wretch . sometimes a romantic comedy can get away with being ridiculous as it strives to pull us into its wish fulfillment . what it can't get away with is being lazy or being miscast , the two blunders that insure never been kissed never had a chance . if only the script had shown as much dilligence with the other elements . arquette's character is potentially even more interesting than barrymore's -- a jock who peaked at 18 trying to re-live his glory days -- but it's generally watered-down and ignored . -- and builds to a spectacularly clumsy conclusion . most depressing of all is a ghastly device which finds josie wearing a miniature camera , contributing nothing more to the story than pointless cutaways to josie's co-workers gaping or cringing in embarrassment . there's plenty to gape and cringe at as barrymore plays josie . even the marketing people at fox realize that she's most appealing as a sweet object of desire , making the central image in the film's publicity a photo of barrymore smiling coquettishly with knee drawn up to her chest . it's slightly embarrassing watching her play the professional josie as a tightly-coiffed fussbudget correcting everyone's grammar and usage ; as implausible as she may be as a high school senior , she proves even more implausible as a grown-up . you always want to like a film as good-natured as never been kissed , even though it wants so much to be liked . there simply isn't a nuance to the material that director raja gosnell manages to capture , not a moment of sincere emotion , nothing that doesn't look like it wouldn't exist if not for other movies about kids in high school . when the script manages to work in a wise observation -- like the idea that one popular person in high school can dictate who's cool and who's not -- it feels like someone tripped over it accidentally . never been kissed is most certainly a fantasy for anyone who ever felt like the quintessential high school outsider , but the film-makers are living in a fantasy world if they think that's all they need to deliver . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
james merendino's slc punk ! has something deep and insightful to say about the nature of youthful rebellion . sort of . maybe . i think . it's sort of hard to tell through all the bombast of merendino's hyperactive period piece , which tries to be a sort of nostalgic breakfast club for the dead kennedys set but misses the point entirely . it's one thing to make a film about teens grousing over the sell-outs of adulthood and the trials of coping with societal expectations , and target it at the teens themselves ; it's quite another to make such a film and target it at those who've already been through that melodramatic wringer . the simple enjoyment that might have come from the time and the tunes instead turns into a 90 minute wait for the characters to get a clue . our tour guide through slc punk ! like many an independent comedy , slc punk ! has enough frantic energy to guarantee at least a few belly laughs -- notably during stevo's spin through a party describing the various sub-plots in action , and a scene showing our protagonists as pre-punk , " dungeons and dragons " -obsessed middle-schoolers . also like many an independent comedy , it often has nothing _but_ frantic energy . for every decent gag or clever insight , you can count on at least two or three self-indulgent uses of direct address to the camera in which stevo rails about religious oppression or the plague of poseurs ( i . e . , those who son the garb without walking the walk ) . scenes which i'm assuming should come off as either amusing or wise-beyond-his-years instead come off as merely damp ; if spittle were diamonds , matthew lillard's performance would surely be a piece of comic jewelry fit for a princess . once again , a film-maker's attempt to connect with the audience through narration becomes a lazy failure . slc punk ! tries to score its major profundity points when stevo is hit by the bombshell that rebellious youth are just conformists of a different kind . well , you can file that one under " d " for " duh ; " stevo's revelation is one with which any audience member over the age of 25 will already be quite familiar . it's that kind of pseudo-wisdom that makes slc punk ! far more tiresome than a film built around devotion to the ramones should have been . when tragedy strikes one of the film's significant characters late in the film , and merendino tries to play it as a genuine tragedy , you realize he hasn't remotely earned an emotional response . slc punk ! blasts through its set pieces with little film-making prowess , then expects to tie it all together by having stevo blubber away at misspent youth . poseurs , indeed . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
i am reminded of a favorite line from the coen brothers' 1991 film barton fink in this era of the wildly over-produced blockbuster . do you need , a road map ? " when it comes to genre film-making , there's an easy way to get the audience to respond the way you want them to respond , and there's the way writer/director stephen sommers chooses to craft his remake of the mummy . rarely has a film exterted so much narrative effort to say so little . unlike the 1932 original , this version is more action-adventure than horror , focusing on derring-do over scaring-do . it certainly delivers its share of fight sequences ; some of them are even fairly rousing , combining unique visual effects with narrow escapes and a dose of visual humor . the echoes of raiders of the lost ark are obvious , but the mummy may actually owe an equal debt to sam raimi's army of darkness in its attempts at supernatural slapstick . though nowhere near the level of the " indiana jones " films -- and indeed , not even necessarily at the level of army of darkness -- the mummy at times manages to deliver the goods . the goals of a film like the mummy should be fairly simple , yet sommers manages to miss the point entirely over and over again . the plot summary above doesn't do remote justice to the sacks of exposition , extraneous plot threads and go-nowhere characters with which the mummy is burdened . the film takes forever to set up the premise , with the exploration party finally reaching hamunaptra at about the one hour mark . there's no economy to the mummy , no understanding of how to create a solid hero , a solid villain and a solid conflict and let the action roll . it would be easy enough to snipe at the dopey dialogue and silly performances in the mummy -- i'm still waiting for someone to convince me that brendan fraser has leading-man charm -- especially since it would deserve every snipe . there are a few clever touches , but mostly sommers seems to show the typical blockbuster disdain for characters and situations which do anything more than set up the next effects shot . yet such complaints miss the point that the mummy isn't even a good brainless action film with its lumbering pacing . all the jaw-dropping visual trickery in the world doesn't help if a film wanders around in circles before pulling out its " a " material . groan if you must , but the mummy needed to be wrapped up much more tightly . the mummy , horror picture . . . what do you need , a road map ? see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
there are few central dramatic conflicts trickier to pull off -- or more potentially annoying -- than a mid-life crisis . the protagonist can easyily become unsympathetic , his introspection little more than self-indulgence . it's rare to find a character with the potential to turn a family man's grass-is-always-greener musings into something compelling , but that's exactly what we find in chris lloyd ( christian bale ) , the central figure in metroland . what a shame that potential isn't remotely realized . metroland is a character study with huge chunks of context missing , a surface-level gloss on the clash between youthful idealism and adult responsibility . plenty of things about chris are intriguing conceptually . as mid-life crisis material goes , this is pretty unique stuff : a man who strays not so much because he's unhappy with what he has , but because he figures he's _supposed_ to be unhappy . don't make the mistake of assuming director philip saville and screenwriter adrian hodges will flesh out those ideas . it never spends enough time developing the friendship with toni that will color chris' entire life . it never explores toni's character in any depth , relying on third-party psychoanalysis to explain his motivations . there's a consistent superficiality to metroland , a refusal to give the characters a depth that makes plot developments -- like a late revelation regarding marion -- feel anything but arbitrary and exploitative . there's some nice atmosphere to metroland , particularly from mark knopfler's silky score and an effective period look , but it doesn't come close to making up for the narrative shortcomings . it doesn't help that seville uses inefficient techniques like cross-cutting with 1977 chris' pondering face throughout the 1968 flashbacks , or that christian bale's performance is most notable for his perpetual petulant pout . it's a film in which the only clarity comes from its most obvious observations . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
director : jon turtletaub . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 124 minutes . there was a sense of deja-vu developing long before i actually saw instinct , inspired by the presentation of the basic premise in the trailers . couldn't help but think i'd seen this somewhere before . then i saw the film , and it all became clear . this wasn't just a case of hopkins flexing his hannibal lecter muscles again before taking on the film version of thomas harris' recently-published sequel to the silence of the lambs . he was simply keeping pace with a story that slaps together characters , situations and exact shots from dozens of other films . you could spend a productive day doing little more than ticking off the films from which instinct cribs : one flew over the cuckoo's nest , gorillas in the mist , tarzan , the shawshank redemption and even dead poets society in addition to the silence of the lambs . gerald dipego's script plods along , dropping its familiar cinematic tropes like bread crumbs leading the audience to its responses . there's even a scene of confounding idiocy in which we , the knee-jerking audience , are supposed to cheer for caulder irresponsibly whipping a room full of jailed psychotics into a rebellious frenzy . somehow , in the midst of so much uninspired tripe , anthony hopkins still manages to come through with a performance that's invigorating to watch . sure , it's a spin on hannibal lecter , but it's more fiercely intelligent than anything the rest of the film can deliver . you can't help but lean forward when you hear that seductive baritone ; you can't help but shudder when caulder's neck hinges on the correct answer to a very tricky question . hopkins makes instinct better . he also makes it worse , because everything else looks even more workmanlike , notably cuba gooding jr . 's performance . a little economy and subtlety -- skills hopkins demonstrates even when playing a wild man -- could have served gooding well . sadly , subtlety is one thing instinct has in very short supply . even viewers prepared to sympathize with the film's fuzzy embrace of the state of nature will find this more a philosophical tract ( albeit one with remarkably realistic animatronic apes by stan winston ) than a compelling drama . we all know man bad/animals good , which makes the decision to turn the humans into cartoonish villains even more perplexing . if there were a moment of real insight into a character , the rest of instinct's brainless cinematic thievery might have been more tolerable . instead , it lets breathing plot devices gab at one another for two hours between unnervingly familiar situations . thank heavens for the entertainment value of anthony hopkins' gloss on film's best-known cannibal . it's only fitting in a film that does plenty of cannibalizing of its own . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , violence ) running time : 115 minutes . the general's daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film we'll see this year -- or perhaps the stupidest clever film . it's confusing to a critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction . the punched-up punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the general's daughter has a brain in its head , even as the remaining 75% of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense . if only the sordidness were the worst of the general's daughter's problems . scenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary , their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filtered-light sleaze . director simon west likely thinks he's covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers , but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches , which is the film's fatal flaw . it's a trend he continues for two hours , taking the story's few virtues and slapping a coat of moron-proof obviousness over them . bubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell . there's something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another . even the lame device of brenner and sunhill's sexual history provides a few winning zingers . goldman's dialogue can serve up a bigger laugh than you'll find in most so-called comedies . dialogue , unfortunately , just isn't enough to make a quality script . by the time the general's daughter wanders towards its over-wrought , psycho-in-the-rain finale , west's heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the film occasionally fun . it's silly and pretentious film-making , but at least it provides a giggle or five . goldman should tear the 15 decent pages out of this script and turn them into a stand-up routine . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : steve franks and tim herlihy & adam sandler . director : dennis dugan . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 91 minutes . as alleged harbingers of the apocalypse go , adam sandler hardly seems worth the consternation . sure , he's a comedian with a routine based primarily on silly voices , screaming , and the broadest of broad humor . he's also just the latest in a long tradition of anarchic adolescent doofus humor , a tradition with forebears like the three stooges , jerry lewis , robin williams and jim carrey . a clown doing poo-poo jokes can still be a pretty entertaining clown , which sandler has done with sporadic effectiveness in his previous films . in big daddy , sandler wants to be one of those laughing on the outside , crying on the inside clowns , and plugs himself into a sentimental , irritatingly generic high concept comedy . and therein the laughs ensue , at least every once in a while . sonny's laissez-faire parenting style produces plenty of scenes in which julian urinates in some public place , wears outrageous clothes , or repeats profanities in his cuter-than-cute widdle boy voice . some are funny , some are groan-worthy , and some just feel a little icky as a troubled child is turned into a prop . it's easier to latch on to the funny , however , when sandler is the irresponsible id-beast we all know and love -- screaming out his dismay over missing mcdonald's breakfast , eating cereal in front of the television , slapping newspapers over julian's wet bed like the boy was a puppy . sandler as a would-be actor , expanding his range with touching personal relationships and gentle romantic banter , is a huge miscalculation . his previous attempt at broadening his audience , last year's the wedding singer , was successful because it remained rooted in silliness and never got excessively mawkish . big daddy is the very epitome of mawkishness , full of cutesy-pie chats with love interest joey lauren adams and sad-eyed father/son moments , all set to teddy castellucci's syrupy string score . worse yet , it's a film into which any one of several dozen actors could have been plugged with no change . it's a film in which the gags are just impediments to the protagonist learning his important life lesson . sandler , with his smirky grin and schoolyard hostility , always looks like he'd rather be learning how to play a nintendo game . there are also plenty of irritating touches , like rob schneider's indiscriminately middle eastern delivery guy and the pound-it-into-the-ground references to hooters . big daddy is the sort of film where it becomes easy to pick on lazy inconsistencies like a televised nhl game announced as " crucial to the standings " despite the fact that the film takes place in october , the first month of the nhl season . if sandler worried about keeping us laughing , and understood he's more fun to watch when he is a child than when he has one , there wouldn't be enough time to get bogged down in the cheap emotions or sloppy writing . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
director : jan de bont . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity , violence ) running time : 110 minutes . it's too bad there couldn't have been a bit more distance between the release of the blair witch project and the making of the haunting -- then , at least , director jan de bont wouldn't have had an excuse . with recent history to consider , it may have made a perverse economic sense to turn shirley jackson's supremely creepy story into a special effects-filled funhouse . then along comes blair witch to prove that you can still rattle an audience with what might be happening rather than a computer-generated representation of what is happening . ironically , blair witch owes a debt to the original 1963 version of the haunting in its study of the psychology of fear . sadly , the haunting circa 1999 owes a debt to jan ( twister , speed 2 ) de bont in its study of thick-headed filmmaking . an even more bitter irony is that this version of the haunting gathers its characters for a study of the psychology of fear . researcher jeffrey marrow ( liam neeson ) brings together three subjects for an experiment , telling them only that it's a study of insomnia . it's fairly clear from the start that the real star of the haunting is the house itself . de bont sprinkles the film liberally with sweeping helicopter shots of the sprawling exterior ; he prowls through the bending hallways and pans across cavernous great rooms ; he lets cinematographer caleb deschanel bathe the ornate bedrooms in muted oranges and reds . eugenio zanetti's production design is certainly eye-catching , offering more detail than one could possibly absorb in one sitting , but at a certain point the sprawling staginess of the house starts to work against the film . it begins to feel like disney's haunted mansion crossed with the winchester mystery house , a tourist attraction designed more for spooky giggles than for genuine shivers . once the house fails to deliver the creepiness , you're left with the treatment of the material , which is literalist to the mundane extreme . robert wise's 1963 the haunting was hardly perfect -- julie harris' hand-wringing fussiness took her nell too far over the edge from the start -- but it began from the principle that fear is about anticipation , not revelation . de bont has no interest in any such subtleties . instead of making a film about the way an environment of terror is more powerful in imagination than in reality , he makes a film about faces appearing in pillowcases , leaping skeletons , windows that turn into big staring eyeballs , and living statues a la ray harryhausen . with its foundation-shaking finale and monstrous apparitions , this isn't a remake of the haunting . it's a remake of poltergeist . of course there's a place for the poltergeists of cinema . generally , however , it helps if that sort of film can tap into something primal , like scary clowns or menacing trees . the haunting can't really be classified as a horror film , because there's nothing remotely horrifying about it , unless you count the inanely expository dialogue ( e . g . , a character reacting to a stairway collapsing : " look , the stairway is collapsing ! " ) . in fact , it's often downright laughable -- sometimes intentionally ( owen wilson's goofball performance ) , sometimes not ( a blissed-out otherworldly ending that makes ghost look restrained ) . de bont has made a film from the school of quips and money shots , all flash and chuckle . he's merely interested in showing off his big-budget toys so everyone can see the thing that goes ooga-booga . that's a pretty limp take on a tale of the ooga-boogas inside our heads . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
it means vaguely drab pixie haircuts , heavily filtered sunlight streaming into an exercise yard , and a non-stop soundtrack from some techno-thai concept of lilith fair . jonathan kaplan's brokedown palace is one of those gritty " issue " dramas that stabs itself in the heart by assuming the audience's sensibilities can only handle so much grit . it may not be particularly inspired story-telling , but it's solid enough . the theme of brokedown palace may not be " look at the squalor of thai prisons , " but it shouldn't have been " look how attractive a thai prison can be with the right cinematography . " kaplan shoots bridge sequences as elaborate music videos , turning his actresses into cute models instead of tormented characters . with a script by first-time screenwriter david arata that forgets sub-plots and provides simplistic outrage , brokedown palace proves itself to be fairly lazy film-making . it pre-digests its story into over-wrought melodrama . it's fairly obvious from the get-go that his character arc will be straight out of casablanca -- a jaded pseudo-rick blaine who gives up his own financial interest for the greater good -- but pullman is an interesting enough actor to pull it off . unfortunately , his story also pulls us away from the two central characters . though in a way that's a good thing -- the fewer scenes spent in the meticulously unpleasant prison , the better -- it's also a distraction from alice's theoretically central conversion to selfless friend . comparisons between brokedown palace and last year's return to paradise are inevitable -- both are tales of americans languishing abroad , seasoned with self-sacrifice for the sake of a friend . but as uneven as return to paradise was , it approached every similar point with more provocative shades of gray . kaplan and arata want desperately for the plight of their characters to matter , but the final hour is too irretrievably phony to provide an emotional pull . viewers who find this sort of morality play uplifting may find their hearts swelling at the conclusion . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : kevin williamson . director : kevin williamson . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , violence , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 95 minutes . kevin williamson needs to remember why he was in a position to direct a film in the first place . on the big screen , williamson made buckets of money for dimension films by writing scream and scream 2 ; on television , he helped raise the wb network's profile by creating " dawson's creek . " in both cases , he managed the nifty trick of subverting the conventions of a genre -- teen horror and teen angst melodrama , respectively -- while still satisfying the traditional audience for each . tingle , an early williamson script dusted off for his first stint in the director's chair , seems to have been written before williamson figured out tone and avoiding cliches . as a teen drama , it's soggy and predictable ; as a thriller , it's a soggy and predictable teen drama ; as a comedy , it's a soggy and predictable teen drama . you might be expecting a dark satirical comedy from that set-up , or perhaps a humor-laced thriller . tingle , which instead opts for absurd sincerity . holmes is an appealing actress , but she's stuck looking pensive and wounded much of the time , thinking deep thoughts while the soundtrack blares with angsty rock . her ostensible growth from timid schoolgirl to self-assured woman is the heart of the film , and a frighteningly weak heart it is . introspection and depth of character has rarely felt such a bore , or so wildly inappropriate . sadly , the same could be said for helen mirren's performance as mrs . tingle . mirren goes for the jugular with every line , and she has some fantastic moments . williamson , unfortunately , isn't sure quite what to do with her . the many sides of eve tingle don't add up to a multi-faceted character . they add up to confusion . the farcical gags with tambor's masochistic coach are over-played , especially when juxtaposed with leigh ann's sympathy for the coach's unsuspecting wife . coughlan's funky energy , and williamson's fairly effective pacing , keep inspiring the hope that something entertaining will be just around the corner . even when he's flopping , williamson is still subverting genre expectations . he's taken a provocative dark comedy thriller and turned it into mush . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
director : john mctiernan . mpaa rating : r ( violence , gore , adult themes ) running time : 104 minutes . from the department of token praise : give john mctiernan and michael crichton some credit for an action film in which the hero is an arab . all right , so the arab hero is played by a spaniard -- hollywood needs to crawl before it can stagger in a remotely straight line . the problem with the 13th warrior isn't its multicultural sensitivity , but the unlikely context in which that subtext is placed . at its core , the film is the kind of swords-and-shields romp little seen since the early '80s heyday of schwarzenegger as conan the barbarian and singer as the beastmaster . that the bonding occurs between rambunctious polytheistic nordic guys and a devout muslim gives the narrative a funky anachronistic flavor -- " dungeons and dragons " for the " why can't we all just get along " '90s . there's nothing automatically off-putting about watching men exchanging prayers in the first millennium -- it's not as though the 20th century introduced the concept of tolerance . it just happens to be the most obvious example of the 13th warrior's insistence on attending to subplots and subtext when it hasn't provided the basic framework for an adventure . ibn fahdlan's norse comrades are so interchangeable and lacking in personality that the press notes identify them both by name and by some trait that might jog the memory -- " helfdane ( fat ) , " " ragnar ( dour ) , " and so on . the wendol remain shadowy and indistinct , never developing into truly threatening villains despite the gasps that accompany the mention of their name . meanwhile , there's time spent on a blink-and-you'll-miss-it romantic interlude for ibn fahdlan , and a bit of norse political intrigue which exists largely to provide one character a chance to scowl and flip his fur cloak dramatically every time he appears on screen . thank heavens for the occasional anarchic battle scene to remind us that this is in fact an adventure film . those battle scenes certainly serve their visceral purpose , perhaps enough so to please the blood 'n' guts crowd . it's just that the whole mess is often too busy to get down to business . on the one hand , it's sort of a nice touch , emphasizing the culture clash with which ibn fahdlan must contend ; on the other hand , it makes the scene such a jumble of cuts and translations that it grows dizzying . mctiernan has toyed with a pseudo-profound action film , and wound up with only a pseudo-action film , another noble effort to file in the department of token praise . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
producers : marsha garces williams and steven haft . director : peter kassovitz . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , violence , profanity ) running time : 114 minutes . there is a scene early in jakob the liar that hints at how much better it could have been . jakob , however , never stops moving . it's an efficient , effective set-up for the character , who is clearly nobody's idea of a hero at the outset . this promising story of an ordinary person doing the extraordinary is burdened from the outset by casting : the " ordinary person " in question , jakob heym , is played by robin williams . i am of the depressing opinion that williams is growing less assured as an actor in his " serious " roles with every passing year . jakob the liar depends on the notion that jakob has to struggle to craft his fictions , but williams always looks like he's struggling _not_ to craft them . oh yes , and then there's that little girl . some viewers will undoubtedly consider the hero's fanciful stories for a young charge too reminiscent of life is beautiful , but those scenes aren't problematic because they're familiar . they're problematic because they're jarring and distracting , introducing a cutesy relationship into a film that shouldn't have been about cutesy relationships . jakob's character arc may be about his willingness to act for the benefit of others , but there are plenty of others without poor little lina . every scene with her feels contrived , pulling jakob the liar away from its central story of hope coming to a previously hopeless people . it is a pleasant surprise to find that jakob the liar is a much grittier production than you might expect from a hollywood-ized holocaust , combining the weighty subject matter with dark humor in some effective ways . there are just too many things going on that prove distracting , whether it's the sketchy romanctic angle involving liev schreiber as an earnest former prizefighter , or williams' incongrous presence , or a sweet but utterly irrelevant little girl . jakob the liar deals with too delicate a subject for such fumbling , and has too compelling a central character to waste . and after one wonderful early scene , you can see the film wasted and fumbled away . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : rodney vaccaro and aline brosh mckenna . director : damon santostefano . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity ) running time : 99 minutes . if i had to pick a " friends " cast member to star in a feature film -- not contribute , mind you , but star -- i'd pick matthew perry . that may seem a fairly faint praise , since -- courtney cox's contribution to two scream ensembles notwithstanding -- the six small screen compadres haven't exactly burned up the big screen . each has his or her appeal , but perry is more well-suited to carrying a mainstream comedy . he's got charm , he's got comic timing . . . he's got most of what you need to give an audience good-natured entertainment . he does not , however , have the right stuff for a variation on tootsie , especially one as ineffectual as three to tango . that's the essence of this romantic comedy that casts perry as chicago architect oscar novak . there are the expected farcical elements -- the amused reactions of those who really know oscar ; the awkward and unwanted attentions of a would-be suitor ; a confusing night in bed with the woman friend -- delivered in a functionally chuckle-inspiring manner . and maybe three to tango could have had a little spark , if there were actually anything for oscar to learn . at the outset , he's a chronically nervous sweetheart with relationship hard luck -- effective for creating a sympathetic protagonist , but useless on a narrative level . imagine oscar as a womanizing homophobe forced to pose as a gay man , and think of how much more robust a farce it could have been . of course , such an angle is too potentially alienating for hollywood , in addition to being all wrong for matthew perry . indeed , he does a great frustration take , and his winning smile makes it easy to root for him to get the girl . perry is almost warm and engaging enough to make three to tango watchable through the sheer appeal of his personality , but he's still entirely wrong for the part . actually , he's right for the part as written , which is pleasant and non-threatening . it's the part that's wrong for the movie . the anger and bitterness of dustin hoffman's michael dorsey gave tootsie its trans-gender kick . because niceness is always oscar's defining quality , three to tango never had a chance at being anything but sporadically nice . and it's only sporadically nice , since perry gets little help from his castmates . platt is quickly becoming cinema's most reliable second banana , but he doesn't get much to work with . then there's neve campbell , whose appeal frankly baffles me . there's a superficial topicality to the film's themes , but it's really the sort of pure froth that lives or dies on the basis of its romantic pairing . if you're able to smile along with oscar and amy's sit-complicated courtship , more power to you . i could only smile along with perry , whose self-deprecating nice guy screen presence deserves a much better vehicle -- preferably one where it makes sense for the protagonist to be a self-deprecating nice guy . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 112 minutes . i spent much of crazy in alabama trying to figure out the connection between its two largely parallel storylines . i spent much of the rest of the time surprised how little i cared . and i spent the final ten minutes marvelling how quickly a pleasant little film can turn ghastly . i must confess that i kept forgiving crazy in alabama its excess just because it was so unexpectedly weird at times , primarily in the lucille-on-the-lam segments . her adventures are so ridiculous it's hard not to smile . the story keeps hopping in so many directions , zestfully directed by banderas , that it's almost impossible to lose interest for long . it also hops back in the direction of peejoe's story , where strangeness generally gives way to sluggish sincerity . crazy in alabama plays its racial themes deadly straight , turning peejoe into a preternaturally wise and moral lad who even gets to shake dr . martin luther king's hand . in more ways than one , it's all black and white -- the buffoonishly nasty sheriff , the calmly liberal father figure , the noble african-american protesters whose plight is rendered in grainy newsreel-style footage . everyone carries on in the expected ways on the expected subjects , all leading to the one-would-hope-obvious conclusion that segregation was a very bad thing indeed , and thank heaven for a few good white people to help set things right . still , the zestful style of the lucille storyline makes it possible to get past the heavy-handedness of the peejoe storyline . . . thus is set in motion one of the most painful courtroom finales in cinema's long , sad history of painful courtroom finales , presided over by rod steiger as the judicial equivalent of col . kurtz . first lucille tells her tale of woe to the jury , rambling on about the horrors of domestic abuse for reasons too contrived to fathom . you'd suspect it was a matter of banderas indulging his real-life leading lady , if not for the fact that steiger follows lucille's monologue with a rant of his own . banderas loses complete control over his actors at the film's conclusion . worse yet , the film takes two sensitive issues -- the subjugation of african-americans and the subjugation of women -- and , in attempting to equate them , doesn't do justice to either one . it's a tragic miscalculation in a film which at least had a chance when it was quirky and frivolous . the real craziness in crazy in alabama is that a viewer might spend so much time giving it the benefit of the doubt . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : kevin smith . director : kevin smith . kevin smith's dogma is offensive . devotees of film industry scuttlebutt probably know that miramax , dogma's original distributor , put the film on the auction block after religious groups started turning up the heat . catholic organizations in particular declaimed the film's subject matter , many proclaiming it sacrilegious sight unseen ( " i don't need to swim in a sewer to know it stinks , " went one typical slice of logic ) . it won't surprise any of those folks when i say dogma is offensive . and i'm not even talking about the theological content . dogma should be offensive to anyone who expects more from a movie than two hours of a filmmaker's musings on every religious notion that ever came into his head . those musings are linked -- rather tenuously -- to a plot involving the very fate of existence itself . and oh boy , are there plenty of lengthy conversations . smith's eternity-threatening premise is probably meant to distract from an otherwise non-stop series of metaphysical/scriptural/doctrinal discussions on everything from the nature of god to religious intolerance . it doesn't . dogma is an incredibly long sit , a deep-n-profound dorm room debate of a movie without the benefit of cold pizza and beer . sometimes smith is simply snarky ( a deconstruction of " the walrus and the carpenter " as a critique of organized religion ) , in which cases he often churns out genuine laughs . when smith actually does get into the events of his plot , things don't get much better . smith has always been a filmmaker only in the most nominal sense , but his limitations are even more evident when he makes a half-hearted effort to add supernatural action to the mix ( radically shifting the tone from comedy to grim violence along the way ) . in a way , the low-tech fight sequences have their charms ; battles always seem to occur just outside the frame , and people come flying through the air from improbable directions . it's hard to cut smith that much slack , though , because you can't help but think his choices are based entirely on his limited visual vocabulary . he'll point a camera at people sitting around a table as long as you'll let him . i suppose the most frustrating thing about dogma is that , whatever your feelings about its messages , kevin smith is the wrong messenger . it's not that his insights aren't insightful -- he has some interesting things to say about faith , religions and self-righteousness -- but that he's pitching his weighty notions in such a scattershot fashion . life of brian could get away with borderine sacrilege because monty python played it smart and scathing ; dogma may be a sincere expression of belief , but it's too juvenile too often . smith opens the film with a disclaimer that the film is only meant to be a satire , then includes a comment to the effect that " god must have a sense of humor . . . you simply _must_ do better than that if you want to turn sacred cows into fajitas . i hope smith feels better about religion after venting his spleen into a feature film . losing two hours to deep thoughts wrapped in limp jokes -- now _that_ i find offensive . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : andrew w . marlowe . director : peter hyams . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , nudity , sexual situations , adult themes ) . running time : 118 minutes . for about ten seconds , there is the faint hope that end of days is clued in to its own absurdity . it's a nice line , and it couldn't come at a more crucial time . for over an hour , end of days fairly drowns in preposterousness . it's the kind of film where a suspect is found carrying a matchbook that leads jericho directly to important clues , and where the same suspect also has something jericho cleverly intuits is christine's name carved into his stomach . after sixty minutes of painful head smacking , i was ready for that glimmer of hope . maybe , just maybe , it was time to start having some fun with the end of the world as we know it . this , however , is a supernatural thriller that takes itself far too seriously . one assumes this is meant to be a chance for schwarzenegger to stretch his serious actor muscles in a plot line ready-made for a little redemption ( christine owns a music box just like his daughter had , in case the surrogate daughter angle was too obscure for you ) . turning end of days into a character piece is a mistake ; letting schwarzenegger play that character is flat-out foolish . it probably seemed like a good idea at the time , since there's also plenty of gun-firin' , helicopter-danglin' , subway car-explodin' action . some of it is even pretty lively , including the early chase sequence in which a suspended schwarzenegger pursues a sniper over a rooftop . there's also quite a bit of unpleasant brutality in the form of snapped necks , severed jugular veins and punched-out vital organs . it's not that you expect satan to be a nice guy -- indeed , gabriel byrne plays him effectively as a smug libertine with a _very_ short temper -- but that it's hard to settle in and enjoy end of days as an adventure thriller when so much is treated as grim and portentous . and that's really the fatal flaw of end of days : it never decides on an appropriate tone . if we're expected simply to enjoy the carnage , it's foolish to make the hero a lost soul . if we're expected to take the dark scenario seriously , the ridiculous plot contrivances make that impossible . end of days could have been effective either as a genre goof or as edgy seven-esque millennial creep show . instead , it's a murky dud that tries to chuckle its way out of the corner it writes itself into . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
if i could be sure what the legend of 19900 is supposeed to be about -- or have any sympathy for what i suspect it's about -- i might actually have enjoyed it . there are certainly some appealing technical elements in giuseppe tornatore's " fable " about a strange character named nineteen hundred ( tim roth ) . for a while , the gilded romanticism of the legend of 1900 makes it easy on the eyes and ears . cinematographer lajos koltai burnishes every frame with a mysterious light , filling the film with a sense of epic nostalgia . the music is frequently captivating as well , with ennio morricone's haunting themes building interest in the eccentric nineteen hundred . music also anchors the film's best sequence , in which jazz legend jelly roll morton ( clarence williams iii ) comes to the virginian to challenge nineteen hundred to a piano " duel . " it's all quite fanciful , given an undercurrent of consequence by pruitt taylor vince's performance of thousand-yard stares , flashing back to the friendship that changed max's life . in retrospect , vince deserves immense praise for his work , since he manages to convey the idea that this story has something profound to say . it's actually quite a preposterous piece of work , as it turns out , and not because of its protagonist's unique life . tornatore just doesn't give us any sense of who nineteen hundred is or what he's all about . he isn't so much a character as he is a deliberate enigma -- not becuase he's complex , but because tornatore wants to make him an all-purpose archetype . tim roth gamely tries to give nineteen hundred a human face , but in this " fable " he's not really playing a human . he's just a metaphor for something or other . if forced to guess what he's a metaphor for , i'd have to say it ties in with early themes in the film about immigrants coming to america . the legend of 1900 might have worked as a sympathetic , affectionate acknowledgement of those whose fears held them back . there's something vaguely pathetic about his paean to boundaries ; it's even more pathetic if we're expected to find him somehow noble in his obsessive fear . the theme also appears far too late in the story , leaving you to wonder about all the preceding filler that simply confuses the question of what this character is all about . eventually , the film implodes under the weight of the importance placed on nineteen hundred's life . it turns out we've been suckered into caring about the fate of a vague symbol , and maybe a vague symbol for something foolish and sad . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
it's about fifteen minutes into flesh and bone before you see the first speck of sunlight , or hear the first note of underscore . in fact , there's almost no movement or sound of any kind . however , there's moody , and then there's comatose . flesh and bone is the perfect example of a solid story choking nearly to death on its own atmosphere . at the heart of flesh and bone is an intriguing character in an intriguing premise . as charming as he can be , quaid simply doesn't have the dramatic range necessary to dig into this complicated character ; when he should be looking introspective and guilt-ridden , he just looks stiff . i was left imagining a jeff bridges in the role , and what might have been given a more versatile actor . other aspects of the performances also left me unsatisfied . meg ryan has the light touch required for the film's few moments of humor , but she doesn't quite strike the balance of strength and accumulated pain required for this role . his performance is too mannered , full of odd jaw movements and rolled eyes . surprisingly , the best performance is turned in by gwyneth paltrow as the savvy gennie , but it's hard to figure what purpose her character serves , other than perhaps to remind arlis of what he could be . for all the problems with the acting , it's another issue entirely that proves to be flesh and bone's ultimate undoing : it's positively snore-inducing . at two hours and ten minutes , it's at * least * twenty minutes too long . there were establishing shots which lasted twice as long as necessary , and meaningful pauses which weren't very meaningful . to make matters worse , there were two minute stretches of dialogue between caan and quaid which were practically indecipherable ( i'm not sure whether to blame the sound mixing or the theater for that one ) . in live theater , there is an expression : " tighten it up . " what flesh and bone needed was a good tightening up . the tone that flesh and bone is going for is fully achieved . everything is working towards a grim tension , and it succeeds , but tension requires release and it's there that flesh and bone doesn't deliver . thanks to an ill-conceived ad campaign , one of the film's key plot points is given away in the trailers , blowing one of those release points for anyone who has seen them . there is a great deal of craft to the broad strokes of flesh and bone . 
screenplay : anna campion and jane campion . director : jane campion . i would never be so crude as to suggest that campion is a man-hater , but it's hard to not to wonder what testosterone-soaked demons haunt her . it's one thing to ask pointed questions about gender-based power dynamics ; it's quite another to ask those questions using such weighty symbolism that it's hard not to laugh out loud at the raving significance-mongering of it all . campion's painfully strident stylings get a workout in holy smoke ! , a film that gets sillier and less insightful the longer i think about it . for a little while , it almost seems that campion is on to something . by mixing in the racist element with the sexist elements of her story , campion promises a film that could have been a fairly complex examination of exerting power and manifesting fear of " otherness . " don't expect anything quite so measured . quickly disintegrates into a sluggish , rib-kicking polemic . for those of you who think one of cinema's most unnecessary images was keitel's free willy in campion's the piano , please consider keitel in lipstick and a skimpy red dress . i suppose some viewers could find themselves intrigued enough by the shifting nature of ruth and walters' relationship to give its freakish elements a pass . i found it far too hard to take holy smoke ! seriously as anything other than an opportunity for campion to rattle our collective cage , whether the image is a nude ruth urinating in front of walters or walters hallucinating ruth as a many-armed indian goddess . it's not so much shallow as it is garish and over-wrought , an important message movie without a solid base of characterization to ground it . it has begun to appear that campion is more concerned with filming themes than with filming stories , struggling against oppression without making that oppression recognizable in human terms . there's no need to use terms like " man-hating " for that kind of film-making . " clumsy " just about says it all . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
every once in a while , i come upon a movie where i simply can't get beyond the basic premise ; as well as certain individual elements might be executed , i'm so turned off by that premise that i can't possibly enjoy the film . there is some charm to be found in the performances , but overall it simply depressed me , and wrapped up a disturbing package far too neatly . becomes the tale of a cruel prank perpetrated on a deeply disturbed little boy , and it becomes extremely unpleasant to watch . aims for an inappropriately upbeat conclusion . dad makes a relatively sincere apology , but for a film which uses serious family problems to set up its hijinks , it's disappointingly timid in dealing with the repercussions . a certain amount of contrivance is practically required in capers such as this , but josh and s . a . m . really pushes the envelope . the event which forces josh to run is a strained sequence involving chris penn as a drunken texan , and he really doesn't work . most baffling is the role played by martha plimpton , an ill-defined runaway who appears and disappears without leaving any recognizable imprint on the story . somewhere in that character was a relevant back-story , but it never made it to the screen . there is even a tossed-off attempt to make her a romantic interest for josh , which is raised and resolved in under five minutes of screen time . as disturbed and disappointed as i was in the story , i have to acknowledge the appeal of the two lead performances . jacob tierney is very good as the bright and resourceful josh , best of all in the obligatory " fool the stupid cop " sequence , and noah fleiss brings real heartbreak to the truly confused sam . the two are convincing brothers throughout , and i liked the rapport between them . still , i found myself dwelling on its handling of a serious subject matter in a manner i found inappropriate . there is no such thing as an objective review , but in this case i can't even pretend otherwise . i found nothing fun about watching two kids in desperate need of therapy taking a joy ride . 
director : matthew warchus . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 106 minutes . sometimes , a play makes for a good film . sometimes it doesn't . it's tough to put a finger on what can make a stage-to-screen translation fall flat , but i know it when i see it . sometimes it feels as though a filmmaker doesn't know how to make a set piece feel like a film ; other times the director seems to be doing little more than turning the film over to the actors reciting their lines . it can also become oleanna . simpatico doesn't fail because director matthew warchus can't give sam shepard's play a distinctly cinematic life ( he does ) or that he lets the actors run roughshod over the production ( he does that too , but it's not the fatal flaw ) . in this case , the play itself is the thing . structurally , simpatico is about as sound a script as they come . revelations about the characters' pasts appear ever-so-gradually , each one adding a shade of significance to events that have gone before . as a tale of guilt and coming to terms with one's mistakes , it's intriguing enough consistently enough that you'll want to keep paying attention . it even offers some genuinely cinematic pleasures , from john toll's eclectic cinematography to stewart copeland's jangly soundtrack . far from the too-typical 1990s script of 1-2-3 plot development , simpatico's story clicks along with unique rhythms . those rhythms just happen to be the rhythms of a play . no matter what is happening on screen in simpatico , it never for a moment feels like the story belongs on film . the characters speak to each other in the clipped tones of a dialogue-dependent medium , full of loaded pauses and oblique references that should come with big glowing asterisks noting " pay attention , this will be important later . " sub-plots and character developments are so fraught with significance -- carter and vinnie slipping casually into one another's lives ; a horse that's not what he appears to be -- you can see the author nodding to himself at the cleverness of it all . even the actors generally look like they're playing to the rafters , with nick nolte all a-growl as the seedy vinnie and albert finney telegraphing his character's unambiguous ambiguity ( only catherine keener , as a vaguely simple-minded woman unwitting involved in the story , shows a welcome subtlety ) . by the time sharon stone blows into the film from some community theater tennessee williams production to play carter's wife , it seems almost impossible that all this is transpiring on a movie screen instead of live and in person . it should go without saying that striving for thematic depth and complexity is not exclusive to the live theater , nor is a labyrinthine plot unworkable on screen . there's simply a quality to simpatico that makes it feel grossly artificial as a film experience . it's easy to watch the film and understand what would make this story a slick , atmospheric character study as a play . as a film , however , it's inert , moving along so deliberately you may begin to feel that you're watching a staged reading committed to film . i don't know if someone could take shepard's play and make it a workable film , but i know this one isn't it . simpatico may make you want to go out and see it as a stage production . . . unless , by the conclusion , you feel that you already have . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
the pelican brief has a lot in common with this summer's the firm . both were directed by " prestige " directors , and both were constructed from the " slicker is better " model of thriller-making . in short , the pelican brief might as well * be * the firm : an overlong , over-plotted , instantly forgettable entertainment sporadically enlivened by decent supporting performances . unfortunately , it doesn't have gene hackman . technically , the pelican brief is just fine . james horner's score works well , even if it does depend overmuch on dissonant piano chords and wood block percussion . the problem with the pelican brief , the movie , is the same thing that's wrong with the pelican brief , the book : there's not a single interesting or original thing happening , either from a story or character perspective . the big conspiracy at the heart of the story is both insipid and insulting to one's intelligence . it's impossible to accept that no one considered the possibility of spacing out the assassinations , or being slightly more creative than putting a bullet in the head of a man who was on a respirator . there's only one possible reason for such stupidity : there wouldn't have been anything for a clever law student to sniff out . grisham's story is loaded with implausibilities and the payoff it offers for accepting them is simply not worth it . the characters in pakula's adaptation don't fare much better . there is not a shred of back story , nothing to suggest why she pursues the assassination story , nothing to make her anything but a positively bland lady in distress . to her credit , roberts' reaction to an explosion is gripping , and she's thoroughly convincing at suggesting dazed trauma , but dazed and traumatized is about as fara as this role goes . denzel washington , one of the most talented and charismatic leading men around , has an equally blank slate with gray grantham ; somehow he manages to act circles around a part where there's really nothing there . only hume cronyn , in a single scene as the aging justice rosenberg , has any spark . no one else has a thing to work with . the firm was no piece of art , but at least its characters were reasonably fleshed out for the screen . the pelican brief asked me to sit through nearly two and a half hours of repetitive chases involving people i didn't care about . a third grisham adaptation , the client , is on its way next year . i suppose it's too much to ask that he's learned to write an interesting story by now . 
screenplay : ehren kruger . director : john frankenheimer . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , nudity , sexual situations ) running time : 105 minutes . i did not out-guess the first released film from an ehren kruger script , arlington road . nor did i out-guess the second released film from an ehren kruger script , scream 3 . kruger has shown himself to be particularly fascinated with labyrinthine plot developments , the kind of stuff that's supposed to leave an audience thinking , " ooooooh , i didn't see that coming . " in arlington road , however , you _could_ have seen it coming . the twist _was_ the story , brilliantly re-casting the entire film as a retrospective experience . scream 3 twisted because it had to , and you got the sense that any one of a dozen possible endings would have seemed just as plausible . once again , i did not out-guess kruger . and , as with scream 3 , it didn't really matter . admittedly , it's sort of a nifty premise . the road to much cinematic garbage has also been littered with nifty premises . reindeer games may not be garbage , but there's also nothing that builds a sense of identification with the film's ostensible hero . affleck is a pleasant enough performer , and he's certainly built like an action star , but there's something he lacks as a screen actor . despite the fact that most of his roles to date have required him to lose his temper , there never seems to be an edge to affleck's performances . any attempts the film makes to dig into who rudy is , or why he does what he does , feel pointless . as the film's central character , affleck is just occupying space . of course , genre films like reindeer games often don't ask more of its characters . he's got a great director for that kind of work in john frankenheimer , who knows how to make the most of dialogue-free mayhem . he's got a top-notch villain in gary sinise ( though you could argue that his characterization doesn't make much sense once all the pieces of the plot fall into place ) . and he's got charlize theron , who's as easy on the eyes as anyone working in film ( and , if i'm any judge , destined to be considered like michelle pfeiffer as an extremely talented actress once people can get past how breathtakingly gorgeous she is ) . the casino heist itself is appropriately frantic , and plenty of kruger's small script moments along the way are slick enough to keep a viewer interested . then come the double-crosses , triple-crosses and quadruple-crosses so fast and so frequent that another one is upon you before you can remember the prefix for the next " -uple " you're up to . there's no question that the events in the final half-hour of reindeer games prove surprising , in the sense that the average viewer probably won't expect them . it's also true that they don't matter in the slightest except as a sort of false cleverness . not only are they arbitrary -- i dare anyone to watch the film a second time and spot a single clue that points in the right direction -- but they're insulting in a film that then goes on to make the denouement an act of supreme stupidity ( hint : try not to leave a trail to your whereabouts if you're leaving the scene of a crime ) . for a simple genre story , reindeer games ties itself up in far too many unnecessary knots . kruger has shown himself to be smarter than your average screenwriter . he has also shown that he can be too interested in proving it . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : wim wenders , ulrich zieger & richard reitiger . director : wim wenders . wim wenders' wings of desire was one of my favorite films of 1988 . as corny as it might sound , i found it to be one of those rare transcendental film experiences , a beautiful and poetic tale of love and human wonder that left me feeling uplifted . i was unsure of how to approach the idea that wenders was making a sequel to this singular film , but i crossed my fingers and hoped for the best . unfortunately , all the good will in the world was unable to salvage faraway , so close ! wenders seems to have been unclear as to what made wings of desire special , weighing down a simple story with self-importance and a ridiculously convoluted plot . faraway , so close ! cassiel resolves to use his physical form to intervene for good where he was unable to do so before , but that resolution proves easier said than done . like wings of desire , faraway , so close ! shows us the angels' world in black and white , and opens with loosely connected scenes of the angels smiling knowingly over human shoulders as they work and worry . but unless my memory fails me , those scenes go on far longer in faraway , and they become extremely tedious . this prologue seemed to go on and on , and while it did provide information necessary later in the story , it could have been done much more efficiently . there are too many characters , many of whom are completely irrelevant to the story . the film's second act is by far its most effective . the marvelously expressive sander is great during these scenes , drifting into drunken despondency with genuine pain . wanders through the film making ominous but opaque statements like , " time is the absence of money , " becomes thoroughly oppressive in the final half hour . faraway , so close ! peter falk , who was so good in wings of desire as damiel's guide to humanity , is simply comic relief here , although a scene involving the distraction of two security guards is very funny . wings of desire was whimsical , but never dopey , and faraway has a real problem finding its tone . perhaps the most egregious sin in faraway is a preachy epilogue that seems only tangentially connected to the film we just spent two and a half hours watching . wings of desire was a kind of message film , but the message was skillfully delivered ; in the intervening five years , wenders seems to have had all the subtlety sucked out of him . the moments that do work in faraway , so close ! are mired in overplotting , and there's never any flow to the story . what's worse , it has tainted my memories of wings of desire . i think i need to rent it tonight . 
filmed and directed by dan geller and dayna goldfine . none so chose . unfortunately , it's not particularly successful . frosh captures moments , but due to its overly large canvas it doesn't capture enough growth . cheng , a first generation chinese-american , quips about stanford's liberal bias while coping with academic difficulties . i should preface my comments by stating that i spent three years , in various capacities , living in freshman dorms at stanford . i wasn't expecting to see anything i'd never seen before ; what i was expecting was a film that highlighted real growing experiences , and allowed viewers to watch the first tentative steps of kids into adulthood . a few such moments in frosh work extremely well , particularly shayne's emotional discussion with a few friends about why she's considering leaving the catholic church . but there aren't enough of these moments . frosh seems more interested in being a kind of rapidly edited video yearbook , and like most yearbooks it's only going to be really significant to those who lived the moments . part of the problem with frosh is that even the nine-student focus is too large . frosh will uncover an issue in one of their lives , but doesn't take the time to show us the resolution . we never learn , for example , if at the end of the year shayne is still a church-going catholic ; we never learn how cheng recovers from his disappointing first-quarter grades . when it's all said and done , frosh comes off as an interesting anthropological footnote , but not a particularly deep or insightful look at why the freshman year at a residential university is so significant . my primary bone of contention is that in its attempt to keep its brow relatively high , frosh almost completely ignores two of the most challenging issues of the freshman year : romantic relationships and substance use . there is one look at a blind date , but little more . perhaps out of fear of scaring off their subjects , geller and goldfine have excised most material parents wouldn't want to know . in one scene , a professor tells debbie as she attempts to describe a term paper topic , " you're babbling " ; in another , one dormmate asks shayne , " if there was no , like , racism or sexism , what would you talk about ? " where it comes up short is as an examination of how much an individual can change in these nine pivotal months . trust me . . . i was there . 
screenplay : glen morgan & james wong and jeffrey reddick . producers : warren zide & craig perry and glen morgan . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 95 minutes . after enduring final destination , i have a renewed appreciation for david duchovny . i've always found his work on " the x-files " to be plenty entertaining , but i never realized how integral his performance as fox " spooky " mulder was to the success of the show . duchovny has one of the most thankless jobs on television : he spends a fair portion of every single episode spitting out ridiculous speculative exposition . mulder's leaps of logic make him the bob beamon of investigative analysis ; it is only because duchovny plays his dialogue with a strange combination of confidence and deadpan resignation that you don't want to throw something at the screen every time mulder zigs from the point a of " victim with cut throat " to the point z of " werewolf on the prowl . " devon sawa . characters like the mortician are commonplace in supernatural horror films -- the protagonist has to have some expert from whom to learn the rules of the strange game he finds himself playing -- but this particular character is a ridiculous contrivance . it doesn't help that sawa doesn't exactly act the heck out of the part . the performers are generally functional at best -- chad e . donella , himself an " x-files " veteran as this season's tormented brain-sucker , is a notable exception -- but it's the tragic combination of sawa and the script that sinks the film . with sawa dispensing those rules to the audience , they're laughable . a more seasoned actor might have made something of alex's ever-more-obsessive interest in figuring out the workings of fate . sawa fumbles and flounders , lacking the least shred of what duchovny brings to similarly exaggerated material . critics and viewers have learned not to expect much from horror films heavy on teen cast members , even those with potentially promising pedigrees ( e . g . still , you want to believe that talented people can take a unique premise and give it a jolt of creativity . they're just missing one crucial piece : a lead actor who knows how to play the patently absurd with a wink and a shiver . final destination is left to play around with rube goldberg deathtraps , fatally bereft of anyone who can take the silly and make it spooky . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , nudity , adult themes , brief drug use ) running time : 105 minutes . [warning : elements of this review may be considered spoilers . proceed at your own risk . ] on the off chance that the rest of the film hadn't already irritated you or bored you to distraction -- and trust me , it will do one or the other -- keith gordon's waking the dead offers a special treat during its climactic scene . the wrongness of that setting may not strike you immediately , until you consider the context . without any identification . any guesses as to whether a real , living person would have pulled off that tidy little stunt ? it's a truly logic-numbing moment , but it's indicative of why waking the dead is such a catatonic failure . gordon lays on the brooding score , the lingering close-ups and the ominous fades-to-white , apparently intent on creating a phil spector-like wall of despair . as a tone piece , it's beyond reproach ; if you don't clue in to how waking the dead is supposed to make you feel , you've probably fallen asleep . not that anyone could blame you . waking the dead may do a splendid job of manufacturing gloom , but it's incapable of giving you any reason to care about its characters . crudup and connelly are steady , competent actors , but there's nothing they can do to make the relationship between fielding and sarah as transcendently life-changing as we must believe it was . in fact , gordon shows almost no understanding for how to play his most critical emotional moments . gordon's litany of miscalculations adds up to a film that clearly wasn't constructed to build characters . every supporting character is an afterthought -- wasting janet mcteer , as fielding's sister , should warrant some sort of fine -- but that doesn't explain why even the main characters are afterthoughts . in an ironic late piece of dialogue , sarah warns fielding to view her as a complete person , " not an image , not an idea . " images and ideas are all gordon and company have in waking the dead ; there's not a complete person to be found in this scattershot narrative . there is plenty of atmospheric intensity , though , plenty of bodies wracked with sobs and plenty of evocative lighting and/or iconography . and there's a final confrontation that effectively evokes surreality . it's effective because there's nothing to ground it -- or anything else in waking the dead -- in the reality of human experience . without any identification . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : dana stevens . director : michael apted . good thrillers are hard to find , and i am inordinately fond of good thrillers . in combination , these two factors lead me to do things like give an " 8 " rating to malice ( which i still defend , incidently ) . the catharsis that a suspenseful tale provides seems to me to be the essence of what movies are for many viewers : a visual rollercoaster . however , far more common than good thrillers are slapdash would-be scarefests stitched together from other better films like some celluloid frankenstein's monster . witness blink : one part rear window , two parts jennifer 8 , and one part from just about every suspense film cliche you could come up with if given a week to think about it . there are some things that blink tries to do differently that show some early promise . it's a nice bit of psychology for which i had high hopes . emma's distorted vision is captured by some nifty computer effects and dante spinotti's eerie photography , allowing us into her head quite effectively . it's too bad that potential is wasted on such a positively bland story . for a thriller , blink is almost completely lacking in tension , its one good scare coming with emma's first recognition of the killer's face . there's no opportunity to guess the killer's identity , either , as clues yeield a " so what " result . what is most distressing about that relationship is that it cops out on its character development where it would have been most interesting . stowe shows the blind emma as confident and independent , but without the omnipresent bitterness which characterizes so many blind screen characters ; then , in a bit of irony which might have made o . henry smile , she becomes dependent on others only when she can finally see . but screenwriter dana stevens seems incapable of that level of subtlety , and there seems to be no rhyme or reason to their eventual ( and inevitable ) coupling , and subsequent conflict . it doesn't help that hallstrom is basically a blank , and that quinn does nothing to make him particularly worth her time . if only that were the only fault in the script . here , cops exchange dialogue like : blink could have been a contender . the elements were there . it was just too slow to make any of them count , and too timid to go to the soul of the characters . 
sometimes you can learn a lot about a film from its ad campaign . the television spots for romeo is bleeding featured a high energy , rapid-edit montage which made the film look like an all-out action thriller ; the print ads , on the other hand , featured stylized renderings of the stars in a scene out of a 50's crime comic , with critical blurbs in word balloons . and that about sums up what's wrong with romeo is bleeding . there's a fair amount of style and black-humored mayhem , but underneath it is a film that really doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be a noir thriller or a parody of a noir thriller , and a script that is an absolute mess . stylistically , romeo is bleeding seems to be on the right track . the lighting is evocative , the air is usually thick with cigarette smoke , and trumpets and saxophones wail plaintively in the background . a running voice-over narrative by jack , told in retrospect and in the third person , achieves the right raymond chandler-esque tone of impending doom . the stage is set to have some fun with film noir conventions--the dumb blonde girlfriend , the urbane mob boss--but that's not what happens . what does happen is that medak and screenwriter hilary henkin decide to serve up a freaked-out combination of 1940s and 1990s crime film sensibilities , sort of a " what if quentin tarantino and abel ferrara collaborated on a phillip marlowe adaptation . " consequently , the tone of romeo is bleeding is radically uneven , with moody conversations slamming into blood-spattered confrontations , and characterizations which don't make a shred of sense . the only logic in romeo is bleeding is the logic of excess , as the filmmakers abandon all pretense of telling a story in the name of the outrageous . structurally , the script for romeo is bleeding is a disaster . jack is developed in a careless , haphazzard manner that left me without any concern for what happened to him . finally , romeo is bleeding commits perhaps its most unpardonable sin with a final showdown between jack and mona which was so anti-climactic that i groaned out loud . at times , the film seems to have been improvised , as though in the middle of shooting someone would periodically say , " hey , wouldn't it be cool to do this ? " romeo is bleeding looks good , occasionally very good , and olin's performance is entertaining , but the film also appears to have been edited with a knife and fork , and amounts to little more than a series of loosely connected scenes with shock value . 
screenplay : e . max frye and topper lillien & carroll cartwright . director : marek kanievska . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 89 minutes . at the age of 75 , paul newman is still one of the sneakiest , most thoroughly professional actors in films . his manner is so relaxed and his charisma so undeniable that it's easy to forget how good he is at what he does ; if newman has ever mailed in a performance , i'd like to know what it was . i find it hard not to get enthused about a caper film like where the money is when i know that newman is in the lead role . after all , no actor has ever done a better job than newman of bringing life and charm to criminals ( butch cassidy & the sundance kid , cool hand luke ) , broken-down has-beens ( slap shot , the verdict ) and slick hustlers ( the sting , the color of money ) . world-weary intelligence fits him like spandex . it's my sad duty to report that there's more weary than world-weary to where the money is , though you can hardly blame newman for its failings . and it's a very , very stupid idea . where the money is , it should be reiterated , has a caper at its core -- an armored car heist executed by henry , carol and wayne . it's an effective enough centerpiece , but it has virtually nothing to do with the rest of the movie . in fact , while the heist sequence is far from breathtaking in its execution -- director marek kanievska appears to have a philosophical objection to making the film interesting to watch on a minute-to-minute basis -- it only makes the central issue of carol's mid-life crisis seem utterly inconsequential . there's nothing wrong with adding some character to a plot-driven caper structure , but that's not what where the money is does . it actually adds more plot -- in the form of wayne's jealous streak , carol's attempts to help free henry , etc . the film pretends it's character-based just long enough to distract from the main story , then ties up everything so quickly you wonder if there were people involved at all . the horrible consequence of this approach is that newman is almost completely wasted . it's not so much that his character spends the first twenty minutes with his face frozen into a rictus , but that no one seems to know what to do with him once henry does come to life . where the money is builds a charge of potential energy from his mere presence . it rarely , however , finds an effective way to release that energy . for the rest of the film he just waits for a reason to be there . it's hard to figure what he saw in the script , since where the money is theoretically is more about carol than it is about henry . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : stephen gaghan . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , combat violence , adult themes ) running time : 128 minutes . i'm not sure which would be more depressing -- if the makers of rules of engagement were simply exploiting soldiers for a gung-ho patriotic courtroom drama , or if they actually believed they were doing justice to the complexities of warfare . the former would be a fairly typical case of hollywood opportunism , a predictable but nonetheless annoying reduction of tangled moral issues to simple flag-waving absolutes . the latter would indicate good intentions gone horribly awry in the execution . from the set-up , there's reason to hope for and expect something more . that's fertile ground to explore the split-second life-and-death decisions involved in combat , including the possibility that good soldiers can still make bad decisions based on emotional reaction . did the gunfire to which childers responded actually come from the jeering crowd below , instead of just from the rooftop snipers above ? is there anything as black-and-white as the notion of a hero where warfare is concerned ? i refer you again to that tag line for the answer to the final question , and by extension every other question the film could have raised . for you see , there is no question about whether or not childers responded appropriately ; there's videotape evidence to prove that he did . the painfully drawn-out courtroom sequences might have been a place for exploring issues of how hair-splitting rules of engagement are interpreted when the bullets are flying . instead , they're a place to conclude that hodges is even a worse lawyer than he self-deprecatingly calls himself , since he never bothers to check the embassy building for the angle of entry of bullet holes . jones and jackson are , of course , talented actors whose intensity makes it easier to watch everything they do . it's simply obvious from the first moments of rules of engagement that they're not playing characters . rules of engagement is about as thoroughly plot-driven as movies get , filled to its two hour-plus rim with action , exposition and testimony . it's too busy being a melodrama to worry about ambiguity or nuance of character , too busy appealing to viewers eager to root for our boys against the bureaucracy . in fact , rules of engagement is so enamored with its own sense of doing justice to military men that it ends with the kind of postscript captions usually associated with fact-based films , just to let you know that those weasels in suits eventually got theirs . heroes will never have to stand alone . not as long as there are simple-minded crowd-pleasers like rules of engagement to stand up for the idea that heroes are always right . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
director : brian levant . mpaa rating : pg ( mild profanity , adult humor ) running time : 90 minutes . brian levant , director of the flintstones in viva rock vegas ( as well as the 1994 flintstones feature ) , says and does everything you'd expect of a sequel to a film based on a television series . he professes his affection for the original series , and his desire to remain true to its spirit . in short , it is levant's goal to create a thoroughly synthesized film experience . that being the case , chalk up viva rock vegas as a smashing success of the most yawn-inducing sort . it's somehow more depressing when a film like viva rock vegas shows flashes of genuinely inspired writing , letting you know that those involved could have done much better if it had mattered at all to them . there's a great gag about circus side-show freaks including " a 40-year-old man , " a wonderful ham-fisted compliment with fred comparing wilma's eyes to " two big eyes " and an addled rock star's vague concern over whether his female companion is a minor . it's also hard not to get a few giggles out of cumming's double-duty as the effete gazoo and the preening mick jagged . in general , though , the film is content to coast on its special effects , its insider humor ( ann-margret , co-star of the elvis presley film viva las vegas , singing the title song ) and its bronto-crane-load of " rock " puns . handling such a recognizable commodity , levant sees no need to rock -- no pun intended -- this particular boat . of course , he has no choice but to deal with a complete overhaul of the original film's cast . john goodman gives way to addy , who's personable enough and bypasses alan reed's fred entirely to go right to the source with a decent imitation of jackie gleason . the muscular baldwin isn't nearly as ideal a barney as rick moranis , nor does johnston match elizabeth perkins' endearingly flat readings of wilma's signature " frad ; " in neither case does the film waste any time explaining how each one shrinks several inches by the time the next film rolls around . only krakowski seems more physically right for her part -- god love rosie o'donnell , but she's no wasp-waist -- and her titter is on target . there's not much one can say to criticize performances like these -- " cartoonish " would be a compliment , after all -- but there's not much that distinguishes them , either . the actors , like most everything else in the film , seem set up not to get in the way of the general feeling of good will . some might argue that a disposable entertainment like viva rock vegas is nothing more than brightly-colored , slapstick-heavy eye candy for the kids , and should be treated as such . it might be easier to buy that reasoning if it didn't take exactly four minutes before the first flatulence joke , and 15 minutes for the first joke about fred and barney sheepishly denying the appearance of a homosexual relationship . i don't recall those as the kind of gags typical of the series for which brian levant expresses so much fond remembrance . the flintstones in viva rock vegas , isolated bursts of genuine humor aside , is a deeply pandering film . it panders to stereotypes ; it panders to the most inane adult nostalgia ; it panders to the most simplistic kiddie humor . that's often the kind of film you get when your primary goal is the comfort of the familiar . . . in this case , humor that was already tired when dinosaurs walked the earth . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : lowell ganz and babaloo mandel . i prefer my comedy with an edge . the war of the roses , ruthless people , and tv's " the simpsons " show that sometimes nothing is funnier than human nature at its nastiest . it is also the case that few comedy conventions irritate me more than starting with an edge and progressively dulling it with warm-fuzziness . so here comes greedy , a promising enough comedy about avaricious relatives , but that fact that it was written by the popular team of lowell ganz and babaloo mandel ( splash , parenthood , city slickers ) should have clued me in that it wouldn't go for the jugular . there are fewer big laughs than in any of those films , as a largely uninteresting cast tries gamely to support a limp story . when it did work , greedy let its nasty characters be their nastiest . unfortunately , none of the laughs are as big as they could have been , and that's primarily because ganz and mandel don't provide their characters with distinct personalities , except for siobhan fallon's horrendously overboard drunk as hartman's wife . they're all sort of interchangeably grasping , and hartman , begley and burns don't have enough manic energy on their own . while several of the lines are funny , none of the characters is funny enough to give them a big push . after that early scene , greedy loses almost all of the bite it might have had . either director jonathan lynn or fox himself wouldn't completely allow danny to get nasty . greedy wimps out when it should be emphasizing lust for money is damaging its characters . a simpler and more relevant criticism of greedy is that it really doesn't do anything new . greedy relatives and fights for an inheritance are film staples , and most previous attempts have handled the subject better . greedy does offer a few giggles , but they get buried under a fairly self-evident message and a slow , unoriginal story . greedy is like a bottle of acid diluted in far too much water : it's just not corrosive enough . 
screenplay : todd phillips and scot armstrong . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , sexual situations , adult humor , profanity ) running time : 92 minutes . it is part of a grand tradition of leering , sniggering comedies in which the anti-social behavior and hormone-fueled idiocy of 18-year-olds ( portrayed by 25-year-olds ) are celebrated for the entertainment of 15-year-olds . but i remember a time when such tales were sublimely crude ( animal house ) rather than ridiculously crude ( american pie ) , when the goal was celebrating an anarchic spirit rather than seeing how much bodily fluid you could get away with in an r-rated film . pushing the envelope , farrelly brothers-style , can be fun ; stuffing the envelope to the point that it requires hundreds of dollars in postage can become a simple , wearying exercise in " can we get away with this ? " if you belong to that demographic that finds a joke most appealing when it's accompanied by a groan of disgust , have we got a treat for you . i believe it should go without saying that the quartet takes a few detours before reaching texas . most of those detours involve the sacred duo of collegiate intemperance : mood-altering substances and sex . only it's just not all that funny . unlike the pointlessly message-mongering american pie , road trip never pretends to be anything more than a cesspool of moral depravity . it's even refreshing in a twisted way that the girl who seduces josh -- inspiring the cross-country recovery mission in the first place -- actually becomes the film's heroine , daring to suggest that sexually aggressive women can also be nice people . but road trip's singularity of purpose doesn't translate into much manic energy . its low-brow set pieces are pitched at obvious incongruities : the pairing of rail-thin kyle with his substantial ladyfriend , an old man sporting an obvious erection , the macho e . l . there's not much of a sense of comic discovery to road trip's gags ; they're the gags teenagers are expected to laugh at . deserved kudos do go to tom green , the mtv variety show host-cum-circus geek who plays the demented barry . green's act can be off-putting , but he's surprisingly funny as the perpetual undergrad with an unhealthy obsession with rubin's pet python ( " unleash the fury " has already become part of my film-based lexicon ) . his scenes are some of the only moments in road trip where you can't be sure exactly what's going to happen next . the rest of this trip meanders through some extremely familiar countryside , and not familiar in a way that inspires fond comparisons to classic genre cousins . road trip is comedy a level removed from anything that could be really funny , because it's all about how funny the mere idea of a profane , stoned dog could be . as the real classics of sophomoric humor have proved over the years , even when it comes to gross-outs , execution is everything . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : scott rosenberg . producers : jerry bruckheimer and mike stenson . director : dominic sena . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , violence , adult themes , brief nudity ) running time : 119 minutes . in an ever-changing world , there's something understandably comforting about the impressive sameness of jerry bruckheimer productions . there's a formula to his films that has rarely let him down , a formula that continues with nary a whiff of change in gone in sixty seconds . since this is a bruckheimer film , you know you can count on . . . 1 ) a premise ready-made for action . 2 ) a style that transcends individual directors . it doesn't matter whether bruckheimer's flavor of the month is tony scott , michael bay , simon west or sixty seconds' helmer dominic sena -- his films all seem to look and sound exactly the same . perhaps it's the fact that bruckheimer is attracted to directors whose background ( like his ) is in commercials and music videos , making them likely to concur with his vision of glossy packaging . maybe he gets his people such great deals on orange lens filters that it's impossible for those directors not to employ them for every single shot . whatever the reason , the quick-cuts , bombastic musical scoring and burnished glow give bruckheimer films that certain grandiose flash that makes for action gold , even if nothing else makes much sense because of in his recent efforts , bruckheimer has shown a distinct inability to strip down an action story to its essentials . gone in sixty seconds is no exception , dragging the pacing down by cramming too many characters into the narrative . that can result in absurd decisions like creating a solid , vicious villain in eccleston , then having his character disappear for literally 80 minutes of the running time , or similarly wasting the forceful presence of vinnie jones ( as memphis' mute , muscular associate ) . it also results in conflicts constructed with a faux-operatic sense of consequence . the family tension between memphis and kip , the non-sparks between memphis and his old flame/running partner sway ( angelina jolie ) , even the history between memphis and lindo's determined detective bog the film down with a ridiculous sense that the story should be taken seriously , when it should be a quick and dirty piece of crowd-pleasing nonsense . those decisions are complicated , for better and worse , by . . . 4 ) provocative casting . cage and duvall are both back for gone in sixty seconds , as is the characteristically diverse bruckheimer supporting cast . somehow , it does make many of bruckheimer's films feel less awful than they should that there are fairly talented actors involved ( cage's descent into genre nonchalance notwithstanding ) . it also seems even more pathetic when they are stuck with scott rosenberg dialogue like " he's bad he's real bad . " or , " i'm not into the life any more . " of course , plenty of viewers will still lap it all up because it all comes coated in . . . eventually , bruckheimer films do move , albeit with a carefully constructed familiarity . the climactic car chase in sixty seconds is a competent piece of film work , accentuated by sena's fetishistic cross-cutting to brakes and clutches , and a car jump as aggressively improbable as anything since speed . it's simply obvious that the whole film was constructed around that chase , making me wish the film-makers could be more honest about their intentions instead of lobbing a dozen pointless sub-plots at us . those who have enjoyed most of bruckheimer's previous films aren't likely to look disdainfully at this one , because it goes nowhere different . it's just another over-blown , sporadically diverting celebration of guy stuff . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
if there has been one theme one can identify running through the work of director barry levinson , it is the search for the american dream . jimmy hollywood is another such story , but it is lacking something previous levinson projects had , namely a firm grasp on what the protagonsists' dreams were . there are interesting ideas in the script , and some of the dry humor characteristic of levinson's dialogue , but it's never all that compelling because the character of jimmy alto is too schizophrenic , and with him the tone of the whole film . one is about the thankless life of being a struggling actor , including the cattle calls , waiting tables and shameless self-promotion necessary to make it . it is typical of levinson to make his heroes' motives less than completely pure , but in this instance they're simply muddled . it is difficult to care all that much about jimmy , and it's difficult to figure out whether levinson wants us to focus on his characters or the setting . it is also a simple truth that jimmy hollywood was a hard film for me to like . while it has its humorous moments , it's too grim to be a purely entertaining comedy , and it doesn't explore its dark themes deeply enough to be an insightful drama . its two principal characters are frequently more pathetic than they are sympathetic , the pacing is extremely deliberate , and the shifts in tone had me shifting in my seat a lot . when i did find interesting elements , it was more a case of detatched admiration than enjoyment . among the objects of admiration were two performances , neither of them joe pesci's . his co-stars , however , are quite good . the big surprise is a funny and affecting christian slater , whose forgetful william does the low-key performance in untamed heart one better . slater is developing into a complete actor , and his performance here is extremely interesting . yet perhaps " interesting " is the faint praise with which i ultimately damn jimmy hollywood . i found a number of things in the film interesting . i just found none of them truly engaging . 
screenplay : ben edlund and john august and joss whedon . mpaa rating : pg ( adult themes , violence ) running time : 93 minutes . why exactly do the drej fear humanity ? he is supposed to be deeply embittered by feelings of abandonment , but why are we supposed to understand that when damon's vocal performance never suggests anything more than mild annoyance ? titan a . e . is a stunningly crafted piece of film animation . it is also inexcusably lazy and dramatically inept , and there is no earthly or after-earthly reason why that had to be the case . director don bluth has made fine animated films like an american tail , the land before time and anastasia , which would be reason enough to hope for the best . but look at the talent credited with this script : ben edlund created the wonderfully satirical comic book " the tick ; " john august wrote the propulsively clever go ; joss whedon co-scripted toy story , and created " buffy the vampire slayer . " put those three writers together , and the law of averages would almost demand something smart , unconventional and utterly original . instead , they pasted together a story so blatantly cribbed from so many different sources that it would be an endless and thankless task to list them all ( star wars , star trek 2 and battlestar galactica are only the most obvious ) . that's not an uncommon problem with films of this genre ; after all , there are certain buttons one is expected to push , and certain hero-on-a-quest motifs one is obliged to include . that doesn't excuse creating a thoroughly unappealing protagonist , introducing an evil alien race whose motivations never make any sense , or filling the script with dialogue that could have come from a random cliche generator . not a single line stuck in my head within minutes of leaving the theater ; not a single character relationship was explored with any care . of course , it doesn't help that virtually every voice performance in titan a . e . feels as though it were completed while the actor involved was preoccupied with some other mundane task , like making dinner reservations , or trying to get out of traffic . damon's lackluster work is most evident , but pullman and barrymore certainly give him a run for his money ; even janeane garofalo and nathan lane are wasted . only john leguizamo , as a high-strung scientist/navigator on korso's ship , seems at all interested in creating a character , and he does so primarily by talking really fast in a squeaky voice . there isn't a single moment in titan a . e . when a performance feels directed . bluth and co-director gary goldman appear to have felt the actors had done their job if they read their lines without stuttering . there's no question that titan a . e . is visually striking , and that the action sequences are well-paced . there are two stunning flights of fantasy in particular that briefly give the film a vivid sense of place : a planet with a sea covered in plants that bloom as hovering balls of hydrogen , and a nebula filled with massive reflective ice crystals . both effects are computer generated , and the mix of conventional animation and cgi elements continues to push the boundaries of the form . but titan a . e . can't survive on its dazzle ; it's too grim and mirthless to hold anyone's interest as pure fantasy . this is one long , long 90 minute wait for us to see whether cale and his cohorts can save humanity . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
having ventured into the fairy tale realms of relationship dynamics in 1999's cinderella story she's all that , director robert iscove and freddie prinze jr . clearly felt there was a more contemporary spin on male-female interaction that they could rip to shreds for a youth audience . then they have sex , and everything gets terribly complicated despite the fact that they tell each other they both believe it was a mistake . paging nora ephron : i hope you've got your attorney ready , because this is one slam-dunk of a plagiarism case . sure , there are a few minor variations -- in this incarnation , it's ryan who's the type a sally albright , and jennifer who's the type b harry burns -- but the devil is in the details . jennifer tells ryan that she's got a date , then suggests that ryan should " get out there " as well . and so on , and so on . granted , hollywood has always been in the recycling business , and there are far worse romantic comedies to use as a model than when harry met sally . but boys and girls does what most bad copies of good films do : it mimics a structure without having the faintest grasp of the insight or charm that fueled the original . the script , credited to " the drews " ( actors andrew lowery and andrew miller , whose only previous screen credit as writers came for the dennis rodman action vehicle simon sez ) , doubles the pain of lame situations by adding horribly forced banter , the kind of stuff that just makes you feel sorry for the people reading it . boys and girls does have a great supporting cast in biggs , detmer and erstwhile blair witch victim heather donahue ( virtually unrecognizable as a blonde ) ; their energy makes the film almost watchable , since one or more of them is on screen much of the time . unfortunately , the force of their personalities just makes the hole at the center of the film all the more evident . it would be easy enough for that interpretation to be read as a cheap bit of freddie prinze jr . -bashing , which it actually is not . granted , it's a ghastly sight watching prinze pretend to be a geeky , braces-wearing 16-year-old , but he's relaxed and pleasant enough for most of the film . claire forlani also does a perfectly serviceable job considering how little context is provided for her personality . all that remains is a familiar shell that has been filled with silly nightclub choreography and a complete lack of chemistry between the two leads . it's a shallow little film that's just not funny enough or perceptive enough to register as anything but weak imitation . the opening credits re-make of j . geils band's " love stinks " is merely a clever diversion ; apparently harry connick jr . was unavailable to do the honors . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : marlon wayans & shawn wayans and phil beauman & buddy johnson and jason friedberg & aaron seltzer . director : keenen ivory wayans . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , adult themes , drug use , profanity , brief nudity , violence ) running time : 85 minutes . scary movie's least obvious joke -- and this is a film that never met an obvious joke it wasn't willing to beat to a slow , bloody death -- is its title . scream , one of the 1990s horror films that inspired this genre parody , went into production with the working title of . . . scary movie . scary movie , on the other hand , went into production with the working title scream if you know what i did last halloween . that title may have rolled off the tongue slightly easier than that of shawn and marlon wayans' previous genre parody , don't be a menace to south central while drinking your juice in the hood , but that ain't saying much . these particular members of the wayans clan seem singularly fond of spelling out not just the general type of film they're sending up , but each and every individual film they're going to acknowledge within that send-up . i'm not sure whether the entire concept of scattershot genre parody is beyond my appreciation at this point , or whether scary movie simply made me feel like that was the case . i do know that it ended up making me cringe more often than it made me laugh . as much as scary movie owes to the zucker-abrahams-zucker team in its basic structure , it may owe even more to the farrelly brothers . simply put , this is as breathtakingly crude and tasteless a film as you'll see without going into the curtained-off area of your local video store . it's not that some of the crude sight gags aren't funny ; a few of them are worth big embarrassed chuckles . unfortunately , far more are either lazy or get really old really fast . scary movie boasts not one , not two , but three flatulence jokes , in addition to not one , not two , not three , etc . but at least half a dozen oral sex jokes . and that's saying nothing of the entire glaad protest's worth of cheap sexual orientation gags . i suspect the wayans brothers know their audience well enough to know that nothing will get the guffaws going better than an effeminate football player , or a butch girls' gym teacher , or a forest of overgrown pubic hair . i also know i've rarely felt as pandered to for so little playful pay-off . when the wayans' finally do turn their attention to gags with specific reference points -- the scream trilogy , i know what you did last summer , even an improbable nod to the usual suspects -- their batting average doesn't improve much . inevitably at least a few gags are going to hit , most of which involve the pre-title attack on electra . others are seemingly obligatory swipes at already-tired targets like the sixth sense's " i see dead people " line , titanic's " king of the world " line , heather's confession in the blair witch project and the ubiquitous " wassup " guys from the budweiser ads . there's rarely any confusion over the source of any referential gag , because director keenen ivory wayans will usually let a scene run on for two or three minutes of set-up before ever getting to the punch line . a film like this has to jab and move , letting its gags stand or fall without someone pointing to them and shouting , " hey , isn't _that_ funny ? " before scary movie's release , several critics wondered aloud how it could satirize a film that was itself a satire of other films . the premise wasn't entirely accurate , since scream was always a horror film itself , albeit a deconstruction of horror films within the genre . scary movie's problem isn't that it tries to do things scream already did better , but that it's not funny enough often enough . perhaps if more of the humor had hovered around the margins ( like the labels on a restroom condom machine ) instead of over-staying its welcome ( like the fate of a talkative movie theater patron ) , scary movie could have felt less like a marketing hook in search of some actual comedy . it doesn't take much creativity or wit to nudge an audience with pop culture references . it just takes naming your film something obvious like scream if you know what i did last halloween . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : clark gregg . director : robert zemeckis . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 130 minutes . a word of sympathy , first , for what lies beneath's director robert zemeckis : it's probably not his fault that dreamworks has been marketing the film with one of the most appallingly wrong-headed trailer and advertising campaigns i've ever seen . my critic colleagues and i often respond to certain overly-expository trailers with the comment , " well , i don't have to see the movie now . " never has that been more true than in the case of what lies beneath . if you've seen the theatrical trailer for the film -- or virtually any of the commercials or plot summary blurbs , for that matter -- you've been cheated . what lies beneath is one half creepy , effective suspense thriller and one half predictable , over-wrought suspense thriller . . . and the creepy , effective half is utterly destroyed by too much foreknowledge . you will find no reference herein to a later turn of plot that dominates advertising for the film . there may be someone out there who could be thoroughly caught up in zemeckis' knowing homage to hitchcock ( most specifically rear window ) , with its instantly loaded atmosphere of menace and a notable absence of underscore that makes many scenes even more unsettling . unlike that hypothetical someone , however , i knew what was coming . i knew the developments that would dominate the second half of the film , and their relationship to the events in the first half of the film . i realized that my time was being wasted on a set-up that had been blasted into irrelevance by some marketing wizard with an itchy trigger finger , the sort of cinematic thickhead who would have looked at psycho in 1960 and said , " hey , let's put that girl getting stabbed in the shower in the trailer -- that's good stuff . " and i grew angrier , and angrier , and angrier . i grew angrier still when i saw the frantic mess that dreamworks had seen fit to promote so hard . it's bad enough that the potentially eerie ghost story of what lies beneath's first act turns into run-of-the-mill run-from-the-killer movie . worse yet is the way the film's conclusion is drawn out to such an agonizing degree that the approximately 2 , 647 individual shock scenes -- each one accompanied by a burst of alan silvestri's strings , of course -- become numbing in their every-60-seconds predictability . the final 25 minutes of what lies beneath eventually degenerate into such an absurd parody of scary movie climaxes i kept waiting for a wayans brother to appear and exclaim , " whazzup ? ! ?

while watching loser , it occurred to me that amy heckerling's true genius as a film-maker is casting . she seems to understand instinctively how to find performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws . giving appealing actors an appealing script creates likeable movies . giving appealing actors a script in which their appeal _is_ the movie makes for unexpectedly awful films like loser . naturally , heckerling makes her protagonist an all-around swell guy . i must confess that , for a while , i was suckered in by heckerling's casting . jason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him even easier to embrace ; suvari is a coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence . they're pleasant enough to watch , and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are and how nice their respective antagonists aren't . then it gradually becomes clear that there's virtually nothing to loser but scenes of that sort . in theory , loser is a romantic comedy , but there is scarcely a laugh to be found in the entire film ( notable exception : a cameo by a scene-stealing comic actor as a video store clerk ) . instead of taking any time to make the characters' situations funny , heckerling spends 98 minutes making her characters' situations pathetic . she shows none of the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked clueless , nor any of that film's interest in lively plotting ( not surprisingly , since clueless's plot came via jane austen's emma ) . she simply turns the film into a pity party . since loser is a film composed almost entirely of establishing character , you might think that those characters would be interesting , or at least slightly complicated . instead , you have people either so perfect or so unredeemable that there's no reason to watch them . paul isn't just a nice guy , he's flawless ; consequently , he's a central character who does absolutely no growing . dora's unthinking devotion to alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty to be found in loser , and even that isn't explored in sufficient detail . there's more ambiguity in the 30-second snippet from alan cumming's broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret then there is in the rest of loser it's one thing to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations ; it's another to flatten your leads into easily digestible mush . and it would help if those comic exaggerations were somehow . . . i don't know . . . comic . still , i spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that heckerling would somehow salvage loser from its tedium and justify my desire to like paul and dora . instead of giving the sequence a knowing wink-a reference to the graduate , a hint that paul is becoming an overly-sensitive clich-heckerling plays it deadly straight . clueless's cher had her self-absorption and manipulative tendencies to balance her cuteness . loser may be a crashing bore , but gee , aren't those two kids swell ? see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : clark gregg . director : robert zemeckis . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 130 minutes . a word of sympathy , first , for what lies beneath's director robert zemeckis : it's probably not his fault that dreamworks has been marketing the film with one of the most appallingly wrong-headed trailer and advertising campaigns i've ever seen . my critic colleagues and i often respond to certain overly-expository trailers with the comment , " well , i don't have to see the movie now . " never has that been more true than in the case of what lies beneath . if you've seen the theatrical trailer for the film -- or virtually any of the commercials or plot summary blurbs , for that matter -- you've been cheated . what lies beneath is one half creepy , effective suspense thriller and one half predictable , over-wrought suspense thriller . . . and the creepy , effective half is utterly destroyed by too much foreknowledge . you will find no reference herein to a later turn of plot that dominates advertising for the film . there may be someone out there who could be thoroughly caught up in zemeckis' knowing homage to hitchcock ( most specifically rear window ) , with its instantly loaded atmosphere of menace and a notable absence of underscore that makes many scenes even more unsettling . unlike that hypothetical someone , however , i knew what was coming . i knew the developments that would dominate the second half of the film , and their relationship to the events in the first half of the film . i realized that my time was being wasted on a set-up that had been blasted into irrelevance by some marketing wizard with an itchy trigger finger , the sort of cinematic thickhead who would have looked at psycho in 1960 and said , " hey , let's put that girl getting stabbed in the shower in the trailer -- that's good stuff . " and i grew angrier , and angrier , and angrier . i grew angrier still when i saw the frantic mess that dreamworks had seen fit to promote so hard . it's bad enough that the potentially eerie ghost story of what lies beneath's first act turns into run-of-the-mill run-from-the-killer movie . worse yet is the way the film's conclusion is drawn out to such an agonizing degree that the approximately 2 , 647 individual shock scenes -- each one accompanied by a burst of alan silvestri's strings , of course -- become numbing in their every-60-seconds predictability . the final 25 minutes of what lies beneath eventually degenerate into such an absurd parody of scary movie climaxes i kept waiting for a wayans brother to appear and exclaim , " whazzup ? ! ? " i won't deny that much of what lies beneath works on a purely visceral level -- i jumped a few times , i was tense a few more times , and so on . there's also one great sequence near the end involving a threat of slow drowning that works on almost every possible level . it's the kind of sequence that makes it hard to hate a film , even when the people selling the film show such open contempt for the audience . and really , there's no other way to describe what dreamworks has done . their marketing department has decided , " our job is to get the people into the theater ; we don't care if we've ruined the experience of actually watching the film in the process . " i don't think what lies beneath would have been a particularly good film even without that disastrous decision -- there's far too much laughable dead weight down the stretch -- but it would have been a much more watchable one . critics are often accused of being too hard on films because of expectations based on how much we know about them ahead of time . at least this time we're going to have plenty of company . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : tom ricostronza and paris qualles . director : matty rich . despite the credit , no one named tom ricostronza worked on the script for the inkwell . novelist trey ellis , who developed the original screenplay , made a rancorous departure from the production over philosophical differences with matty rich , and substituted a pseudonym which is a loose italian translation for " full of excrement . " whatever the specific points of disagreement might have been , it would appear that ellis knew something that rich did not . it is clear that the inkwell could have been a gentle look at a rarely- seen side of the black american experience ; instead , it's a sloppy and ham-fisted collection of caricatures which seems to trip over an occasional truth rather than aiming for any . at times , i thought i might end up liking the inkwell . there was a relaxed , nostalgic tone to some of the scenes featuring drew , and larenz tate brought a geeky , confused charm to drew's fumblings through adolescence . but for every scene which endeared , there were two which annoyed . the inkwell tempts you with sweetness , then smacks you over the head every time you try to embrace it . it's also exceedingly hard to take the inkwell at all seriously with so many characters so miserably realized . glynn turman huffs and puffs as the unashamedly republican uncle spencer , delivering one of those horrible drunken diatribes that only movie drunks deliver . and that's really the fundamental problem with the inkwell . since i knew exactly where it was going , its only chance to work for me was in how it took me there . i wanted to be interested in drew's story , but i was repeatedly drawn away by the seemingly pointless class struggle between kenny and spencer ; i wanted to lose myself in the characters , and they repeatedly reminded me they were phony . time and again , i found myself convinced that matty rich had no real sense of what he wanted to do with this story , so he did a little bit of everything . and somewhere , trey ellis must be having the last laugh . 
screenplay : vince mckewin . director : howard deutch . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 116 minutes . if the theme of the replacements -- and i use the word " theme " so loosely that it may fall off at any moment -- is that certain overpaid entertainers have grown complacent and lazy and that audiences prefer seeing genuine effort , there's more than a teensy bit of irony in it . bad news bears-style comedies have been the preferred brand of sports film since . . . well , since the bad news bears . a lovable loser/band of lovable losers eventually rallies around his/her/its underdog status and surmounts impossible odds to emerge victorious -- what tale could be more fundamentally american ? of course , the " work ethic " is supposed to be fundamentally american , too , but you'd never know it from the sort of sleepwalking screenwriting in the replacements . three guesses whether they make it , and the first two don't count , but never mind that . never mind too that the replacements doesn't exactly treat the labor dispute with any complexity ( owners and striking players bad , cheerleaders and replacement players good ) . movies like the replacements have always been about the hijinks of the players , both on and off the field ; the predictability of the formula has been part of its appeal . there are a some fun characterizations -- jon favreau as an unhinged swat cop-turned-middle linebacker , rhys ifans as chain-smoking welsh soccer player-turned-placekicker nigel -- and some amusing confrontations with the striking players . the losers get better , the bad guys get their comeuppance , there are some decent chuckles along the way , everyone applauds . no muss , no fuss . and no common sense . for a fairly simple comedy , the replacements is full of baffling plot points . why was it necessary to bring in the vaguely blackballed mcginty to lead the replacement team ? why does a team that has been practicing together for less than a week appear to be running complicated passing plays on every down ? even ignoring the most obvious question of all -- why cast keanu reeves as the lead in a comedy -- the replacements appears to have been constructed with no thought but getting to the big ending , when everyone can applaud for the triumphant underdog . what it comes down to , really , is laziness . veteran hack comedy director howard deutch ( grumpier old men , the odd couple ii ) is a button-pusher , knowing how to get the most obvious laughs out of the most obvious situations at the most obvious times . it doesn't take a tactical gridiron genius to realize that the makers of the replacements just don't care . the concept is pre-sold , the fans are in the seats , and the overpaid entertainers couldn't care less about giving their all for the people ultimately paying their salaries . is anyone interested in making a movie about replacement film-makers ? see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : john waters . director : john waters . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 88 minutes . there is something so petulant and defensive about the tone of cecil b . demented that it's almost enough to make you cry for john waters . he made the movies he wanted to make , and damn the sensibilities of anyone else . but times have changed since waters' early '70s heyday . independent film-making came into its own , and while " mainstream " comedy has grown more gratuitously daring in recent years , waters has drifted to the ideological center with campy-yet-tame movies like cry-baby , hairspray and serial mom . in cecil b . demented , waters seems engaged in a desperate attempt to be recognized for his edge once again . he'd show us where his sympathies were ; he'd give it to mainstream hollywood big time . this is what it has come to for the man who introduced coprophagy into the contemporary cinema : crafting a toothless , uninspired satire of hollywood , and using melanie griffith to do it . griffith stars as honey whitlock , a raging bitch of an a-list hollywood actress appearing at a fund-raiser premiere in baltimore for her latest mediocrity . it will be shot in actual theaters and movie sets , recording actual acts of anti-hollywood terrorism . subtlety has never exactly been john waters' strongest suit as a film-maker , so it may be unfair to expect anything different from cecil . nevertheless , it's wearying to sit through a satire that takes such broad , trite shots at its target . waters aims for guffaws from such predictable subjects as the cost of theater concessions , patch adams : the director's cut and unnecessary sequels , then gets even more insider by railing against fines for film set transgressions . even when it seems like he's preparing to let loose with his gloriously bad taste -- a scene in a porn theater where onanistic patrons appear on the verge of defending cecil and company from pursuers with a hail of bodily fluids -- waters backs off to something silly and subdued . cecil's 88 minute , non-stop assault on the obvious may not include a single honest belly laugh . and the sad part is , there are a couple of decent ideas floating around here . griffith's honey isn't really a character -- waters probably hasn't written a real character in his life -- but the charge she gets out of the underground cachet of working with cecil could have made for some sharp jabs at other big-time actors who work on low-budget projects . waters also comes up with an insightful line when cecil notes that there's nowhere for renegade film-makers to go but to the extreme after hollywood has co-opted sex and violence . in neither case does waters take the idea anywhere interesting . griffith's performance is high camp in the grand waters tradition , but there's nothing funny or clever about the way her conversion to cecil's way of thinking is handled . and for an ambush , pseudo-snuff production , cecil's film itself doesn't demonstrate nearly enough creativity or outrage . the way waters approaches his protagonist and his dream project ultimately doom cecil as much as its limp humor . it's certainly clear that waters disdains the vapid product shoveled into american theaters , a sentiment in which he has plenty of company . but it also appears that he has no concern for whether or not cecil's film is going to be any good ; to waters , the simple act of fighting the movie establishment power is enough to make him a hero . it may have been true 25 years ago that a film could be exhilarating just because its creator was daring and thrifty . today , it helps if the film itself is more than an exercise in self-indulgence . the bitter irony is that he's made something just as disposable as patch adams : the director's cut . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
dr . t & the women kicks off with one of those trademarked robert altman sequences of choreographed cacophany . it's a brilliantly economical way to set up a potentially fascinating protagonist . dr . t loves women so much ( in a purely spiritual , madonna-half of the whole madonna/whore thing sort of way ) that he just can't say no to any of them . what a great character to study : a man who idealizes women in a cultural setting -- upper-class southerners -- where plenty of the women are just fine with being idealized . t & the women from being a provocative movie experience : richard gere , and just about everything else . this act one diagnosis underlines every action dr . t makes for the viewer's benefit : ah , note is instinctively sexist-gallant attempts to do everything for bree ! you'd think it might underline things a bit for dr . t himself , especially since he gets the dialogue explaining his wife's condition . gere has never been one of our more subtle actors , but here he simply refuses to give dr . t's pathological sanctification of women any edge . altman and rapp let him off the hook by implicitly suggesting he's just a man tossed about by the forces of estrogen rathern than an example of a particularly unhealthy attitude . and it doesn't help that almost every one of the film's dozen or so female characters is written as a cartoon -- dern as the champagne-swilling , unhappily married belle ; janine turner as a pushy hypochondriac ; tara reid as dr . t's conspiracy buff younger daughter -- making it even easier to see the befuddled dr . t as the victim rather than part of the problem . instead , it's a cheap opportunity to make him almost absurdly sensitive and understanding , when understanding is so clearly what he lacks . t & the women flirts with the kind of symbolism and narrative complexity that can make it seem deep -- be sure to bring an abacus to count the number of connections between water and female sexuality -- but it's actually terribly shallow where it counts . without an actor willing to make dr . t a sexist anachronism in need of some self-awareness , the film is reduced to a two-hour exhibition of limp farce . how depressing to see that wonderfully evocative waiting room turned into the place where the big payoff is someone getting tripped and banging her head on a coffee table . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : john hughes . director : patrick read johnson . just as a little role playing exercise , pretend you're john hughes . the home alone films have grossed somewhere in the neighborhood of a gazillion dollars , and you're not convinced that particular cow has been fully milked . unfortunately , macaulay culkin has crossed the line from adorable moppet to gawky adolescent , and last year's variation on the theme , dennis the menace , didn't do well enough to warrant a sequel . so what do you do ? apparently , you write and produce baby's day out , yet another kiddie-pleaser featuring copious cartoon mayhem directed at bad guys . strangely , though , there is a modicum of originality present , thanks to imaginative visual effects and the charmed wanderings of baby bink . for anyone who has seen either home alone or its carbon copy sequel , there is very little new to be found in baby's day out . mantegna appears embarrassed much of the time , making his slow burn look like a plea for sympathy from the audience . still , there are only so many ways that the male genitalia can be mangled before intense boredom sets in . i heard gales of laughter from kids in my audience at such mid-section humor , but i think they would have responded the same to a 90 minute loop of kicks to the groin . what is most annoying about films like baby's day out is that they pretend to have an emotional message . but baby's day out is no more about good parenting than speed is about traffic safety . hughes and johnson make no attempt to follow up these token gestures with any closure ; it's just typical hughesian troweled-on emotion to make the violence more palatable . if there is one reason for anyone of driving age to sit through baby's day out , it is to see the clever special effects which allow bink to survive every adventure with nary a smudge of dirt to tell the tale . these are fun moments , made all the more appealing by the adorable wortons as bink . naturally , hughes ends baby's day out with a teaser for a sequel . but enough is enough , john . the wortons are probably two by now ; that doesn't mean you can squeeze four more films out of them . 
screenplay : joe batteer & john rice . director : stephen hopkins . sometimes , timing is everything . this year , costner is on the other end , as his wyatt earp was beaten into theaters * and * onto video by tombstone . speed's greatest asset was that it never took itself seriously ; blown away , on the other hand , takes itself far too seriously . though there are some nice moments of suspense , blown away sputters out in puddles of melodrama . there's no better way to describe the key problem with blown away than to say that it's overblown but underdeveloped . everything in the screenplay by joe batteer and john rice feels forced and artificial . nothing exemplifies this more than the attempt to ladle on the irish atmosphere . the characters in blown away speak in heavy brogues , drink guinness , dance jigs , even listen to us . . . everything , practically , but say " faith an' begorrah . " fine , they're irish already ; they're just not real . and the same is true of the big emotional breakdowns , and the slow motion build-ups to the explosions , and the length of nearly every scene . blown away simply never clicks because , like gaerity's bombs , everything is far more convoluted than it needs to be functionally . meanwhile , two of the most talented actors in america are stuck with underwritten characters and ineffectual direction . he brings no energy and none of the intelligence he usually brings to his roles . tommy lee jones doesn't fare much better , as there is never any clear sense of gaerity's motivation or state of mind . he's just plain weird , bouncing on beds and making bizarre videotapes , but for all his supposed cock-eyed creativity he never comes off as smart enough to be genuinely threatening . when two actors like bridges and jones go wrong , it's difficult not to point the finger of blame at a director who wasn't doing his job . though he fails his actors , stephen hopkins has other things working . he manages to create a mounting tension with each subsequent bomb , as we begin to suspect that at any given moment , anything could be a trigger . but the production just isn't lean enough to sustain that energy . watching blown away , i felt that i had had slightly too much to drink : everything seemed a step slow and peter levy's photography seemed slightly out-of-focus . oh , to be sure , there are lots of big explosions in blown away , but the amount of cinematic heat generated could be measured with an oral thermometer . 
having already self-cannibalized the 1961 animated 101 dalmatians in the successful 1996 live-action version , disney had to look for a more creative way to self-cannibalize in the sequel 102 dalmatians . how wonderfully romantic kevin and chloe's relationship must be . . . 102 dalmatians would have had to work hard to be as actively irritating as its john hughes-penned precursor . instead of being actively irritating , this one registers as merely tedious . like the first film , 102 dalmatians is designed primarily as a great big love-fest between the audience members and the on-screen animals . unfortunately , they're almost never asked to do anything more interesting than sit around and look cuddly . lima ( co-director of disney's tarzan , making his first live-action feature ) generally appears content to let the awww appeal of his canine co-stars take the place of action , adventure or humor . you've probably passed the age where 102 dalmatians would appeal to you if you no longer respond to puppies in a movie with a shriek of , " puppies ! " that same overwhelming sense of laziness permeates the film from start to finish . it's blessedly true that 102 dalmatians does not feature a single shot of someone getting his genitals electrocuted , or any mayhem that would bump the rating even to a pg . the slapstick is basically harmless stuff involving dogs biting villains in the rear or cruella's henchman/chauffeur ( tim mcinnerny ) injuring and reinjuring his hands . but there really isn't even all that much slapstick . there's a whole lot of exposition , and it doesn't lead up to anything . in a way , up until the final showdown on a bakery assembly line , it's all rather hypnotically pleasant -- no off-putting violence , no real peril , and no personality . there's also the romantic sub-plot involving kevin and chloe , two of the most blandly attractive characters committed to the screen since the last freddie prinze jr . movie . while close does her best to inject some life into the proceedings -- still playing cruella as a drag queen icon rather than a nasty villain -- the protagonists practically vanish into the background . like far too many sequels , this one just lies there limply , practically daring you not to grant it good will based on another movie . it's bad enough to do that when the other movie in question was successful , but lousy . it's even worse when the good will being traded upon comes from a truly classic cinematic moment . not even a clip from lady and the tramp can make 102 dalmatians worth anything more than a snore . and it doesn't help to prove that cute animated dogs are often preferable to cute real-life dogs . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : nancy meyers and charles shyer . director : charles shyer . if you're making a list of movie terms you don't hear all that often , " caper " has to be right up there . i love trouble is an attempt to resurrect the caper , and you've got to hand it to nancy meyers and charles shyer for trying . they've put two appealing stars with great chemistry in a fast-paced film . they just forgot to give them anything to do . as much as i found myself wanting to enjoy i love trouble , it barely managed to divert me . the problem is that that characterization vanishes after the first fifteen minutes ( easily the film's best fifteen minutes ) . nolte and roberts struggle admirably to generate some kind of life for their characters , but all they can do is flash their thousand watt smiles and hope for the best . and they go farther than they have any right to , purely on the strength of their charm . when they smiled , i frequently smiled right along with them . it sort of makes you wonder what they could have done with a remotely interesting story . the big conspiracy at i love trouble's center is . . . unique , to say the least , but it's fairly tedious stuff . the identity of the villain is apparent from minute one , and i love trouble takes far too long to get into its main plot . in fact , i might go so far as to say that the plot never gets going , nor is it designed to . only there isn't any witty banter . all told , i have to wonder exactly what it is that meyers and shyer did to earn their screenwriting paychecks . their dialogue earns chuckles at best , their sense of pacing is extremely suspect , and their characterizations are wooden . like their baby boom and father of the bride , i love trouble seems designed only to move along affably , without spark or inventiveness of any kind . the fact is , there is nothing truly off-putting about i love trouble . nolte and roberts make an appealing tandem , and roberts' performance in particular is extremely energetic , perhaps her best work to date . but since a movie like i love trouble is inevitable in its outcome--the two reporters * will * end up together--getting there has to be more interesting . without any excitement in the suspense storyline , and with two bland characters contributing to a singularly vanilla romance , i was left watching two beautiful people be beautiful . it just wasn't enough . 
screenplay : rich wilkes . director : michael lehmann . director michael lehmann's 1989 debut has become a cult classic , an acidic satire of contemporary teen culture with a surreal edge , perhaps most famous for launching winona ryder and christian slater on the road to stardom . only a loopy performance by adam sandler and a slightly more energetic final twenty minutes save it from complete disaster . in its appealing trailers , airheads looked like it was going to be a smart comedy about stupid people . consider yourself warned : this is another case where every funny line is in the trailer . the main problem with airheads turns out to be that it's a stupid comedy about people who aren't stupid enough . adam sandler is perfect ; his thick-as-a-brick reading of pip is far and away the best thing about airheads , good for some genuinely inspired comedy . fraser , however , is playing a basically average guy , and buscemi comes off as flat-out intellectual . airheads had the potential for a lot of laughs coming from the reaction of reasonably normal hostages and police to impossibly stupid band members . unfortunately , some of the hostages and most of the police officers are more idiotic than the lone rangers . the result is a bunch of jokes based on lame confrontations between the band members and a militant black d . j . , mckean's fatuous corporate type and each other , consisting almost entirely of third-grade insults focusing on bodily functions and sexual preference . the characters in airheads simply never interact in a way that's remotely interesting or funny . while the character-based comedy fails , airheads might have had a chance if it had actually been about something , if it had had a point of view or and attitude about * anything * . it's not a parody of corporate music , or corporate radio , or heavy metal youth culture , or even other hostage-based movies like dog day afternoon . there are a few clever moments near the end which take shots at the cult of personality surrounding crimes-in-progress ( all too familiar in the wake of the roadside cheering section in the o . j . simpson chase ) , but they come so late that they seem almost incidental . actually , airheads might be viewed cynically as about one very specific thing : selling a tie-in soundtrack album . in a crowd scene near the film's conclusion , there is a glimpse of the michael lehmann of heathers . it's the kind of whacked-out moment that made heathers unique , and there are a couple more like it that briefly give airheads a bit of juice . sadly , they are stretched out over a 90 minute movie . 
screenplay : diane drake . director : norman jewison . oh , and a reference to roman holiday . have i forgotten anything ? it doesn't appear that the makers of only you have . it is packed to bursting with everything that a hollywood romance is supposed to have--except any connection between its stars . as a result , its agonizing cuteness becomes all the more agonizing , and the hole at its center positively gapes . marisa tomei and robert downey jr . end up together ( and please , no one try to tell me that i'm spoiling anything by revealing that fact ) because that's the way it has to end . not because these characters learn anything about each other that would make them want to learn more , and not because they seem right for each other . however , since it's all accompanied by carriage rides and flowers and beautiful italian scenery , it passes for a love story . and that's fairly sad . equally sad is that there is a supporting story to only you which is infinitely more interesting and touching , and might have made for a movie i would truly have enjoyed . " why ? unfortunately , the story isn't about kathy , and i just didn't care about faith's quest for damon . individually , as performers , i generally like marisa tomei and robert downey jr . both usually appear very natural on screen , and downey in particular shows the potential to be a solid , charming romantic leading man . in only you , however , his lovable rascal is completely one-dimensional , and the script's attempts to justify his behavior don't sell . tomei has it even worse , directed by norman jewison to a teeth-aching level of adorableness , but that's just indicative of how everything in only you is pitched : lay on the syrupy score , emphasize sven nykvist's cinematography , throw in romantic signifiers by the dozen . what it all adds up to is a film so mechanical you can almost hear the gears grinding . 
starring : anthony hopkins , matthew broderick , bridget fonda , john cusack , michael lerner , dana carvey . if you can capture that image in your mind , you will know everything you really need to know about why the road to wellville just doesn't quite work . on the one hand , the sumptuous production is filled with delightful period detail ; on the other hand , there isn't all that much going on that one couldn't find in your typical bad , overlong " saturday night live " sketch . somewhere in the road to wellville is a satire of health fads , but it's buried beneath costumes and scatological humor . the result is basically a merchant ivory production of a " benny hill " episode . the road to wellville opens promisingly enough , with a funny scene of a group of women undergoing " laugh therapy . " it's delightfully silly , but it isn't long before it becomes clear that such silliness is about all there is to the road to wellville . actually , it may be more accurate to think of the road to wellville's one joke in broader terms , as the tittering variations on an r-rated farce . at one time or another , all of the following are used as punch lines : vomit , flatulence , sex , bare breasts , masturbation , erections , enemas , urine and feces . i'm hard pressed to come up with anything they might have missed . it's not that none of the gags are amusing ; some of them are . but over two hours of such material truly tests one's patience . that running time seems particularly long because screenwriter and director alan parker lets his narrative wander all over the place . but there isn't anything interesting going on in that sub-plot , except watching cusack take a lot longer than it takes us to figure out that his partner is a fraud . while they may be meant to humanize kellogg , they're really just one more case of where judicious editing might have benefited the film . as with almost everything in the road to wellville , the acting is almost universally too broad , probably as an attempt to disguise the fact that there may not be a single genuinely interesting character in the bunch . matthew broderick is good in a rare adult role , but he's stuck with every actor's bugaboo , the drunk scene , as is cusack . and carvey , naturally , mugs shamelessly . they are all surrounded by marvelous sets , and are well-photographed by peter biziou , but parker hasn't given them any clear sense of exactly why they are making this movie . for a story that's supposed to be a satire , the road to wellville ends up mostly as a parody of itself . 
starring : elijah wood , kevin costner , mare winningham , lexi randall . screenplay : kathy mcworter . director : jon avnet . if they gave out academy awards for earnestness , the war would have to be one of the front-runners . war , it solemnly intones , is bad ; so are racism and sexism . as a result , some very impressive performances are wasted on a script that just tries far too hard to deliver a very simplistic moral . the problem is that it's in too many places . it's not even enough that elvadine gets to tell off the teacher in a completely over-the-top speech ; lidia has to get her two cents in as well . mcworter appears convinced that wherever one speech is good , two must be even better . the script is overloaded with homilies , and needed a good re-write at least fifteen minutes shorter . one of the goals of that re-write should have been removing the characters of lidia and her friends entirely . the relationship between the simmons siblings is given only a cursory treatment , and the narration lidia provides could just as easily have been provided by stu , or not at all . the war is first and foremost about the relationship between stu and stephen , and there are too many tangents which ignore that relationship . when costner and wood are the focus of attention , the war is actually quite compelling . there is tremendous conflict in their relationship , and both actors do a fine job of bringing it out . sadly , mcworter and director jon avnet are more interested in heavy-handedness than they are in character study , so that by the time the climactic battle for the treehouse rolls around , the point has been made and made and made again . now let me get this straight : war is bad , right ? 
screenplay/director : david mamet . the advertising campaign for oleanna features the line , " whatever side you take , you're wrong . " behind that statement is the conceit that this adaptation of david mamet's play , and by extension the original play itself , is a balanced presentation of a controversial issue . it is not . whatever oleanna might be--provocative , infuriating , incendiary--it is not balanced ; it is a technically proficient but inaccessible piece of reactionary agit-prop . there are two fine performances at the center of the film , but it was impossible for me to separate them from mamet's smug attempt to pass this off as thought-provoking theater . those familiar with david mamet's elliptical dialogue will instantly recognize oleanna as his work ; those unfamiliar with it will wonder what the heck he's trying to do . the staccato rhythms don't sound conversational , and in fact sometimes seem even more stagey than conventional stage dialogue . but though the first act of oleanna is occasionally very rough going , there is something compelling about that dialogue . i found myself paying closer attention , and noticing recurring motifs and shifting roles . william h . macy , who originated the role of the professor on broadway , has a gift for making mamet's words sound as close to natural as they can , and gives a haunting and haunted performance . debra eisenstadt is also impressive , alternately cowering and commanding , but the words sound more forced in her mouth . unfortunately , that is symptomatic of what is really wrong with her role . has the professor , by virtue of the power inherent in his position , placed carol in a compromising position , or is carol reacting too much in accord with a pre-determined agenda ? mamet pretends to make a case for both sides , but in reality he has done no such thing . at this point , while carol speaks wearing this insignia on her lapel , nothing that carol says can be taken seriously , even if we are inclined to thing that we may be seeing events through our own prejudiced lenses . issues of politics aside , oleanna just doesn't connect beyond a level of detached technical admiration . perhaps seeing the play live , where post-performance discussions were almost always part of the experience , provided more immediacy , more intensity . on the big screen , for all its controversy , oleanna is just too cold and intellectualized . i think that reaction might inspire mamet to take a good , long look at the messages he is sending . 
screenplay : ronald d . moore and brannon braga . director : david carson . whether or not i would be considered a trekker probably depends on whom you would ask . i have been a fan of both the original series and its recently retired follow-up , as well as the even- numbered entries in the film series . however , i have never been one of those folks who store away trek minutiae and get into debates over the relative merits of spock vs . data . somewhere along the line , the " star trek " film series began to seem more and more directed at those in the latter category , and star trek : generations may be the natural conclusion of this direction . its production values may be high , but the writing is frequently appalling , and instead of a script has a collection of references , in-jokes and ill-defined characters . no sooner is it out on its maiden voyage than a distress signal brings them to the nexus , a mysterious ribbon of energy . i don't think it is an insult to fans of " star trek " to suggest that to a certain extent , the particulars of a plot are not really the most important elements in a " trek " film . but even that interpretation assumes that characterization has to be consistent , and in generations that just doesn't happen . he doesn't get a joke . once the chip is in place , spiner gets to have a lot of fun with data's new emotions , but the point is that he's no longer the data we know . if the rest of the " next generation " cast fares any better , it's only because they're on the screen so little that they're simply window dressing . but then again , this story isn't really about the new crew . it's about kirk and picard , the cowboy and the politician , sharing the screen . stewart's edginess is indicative of what may be a very bad sign for paramount's hopes to turn the new cast into the same kind of franchise the original cast was : these are clearly the not ready for big screen players . only thirty years of history can create a moment like that , and that's time this new crew doesn't have . it certainly doesn't help that the plot they are stuck in is so convoluted and badly constructed that you need to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find your way out again . it's also loaded with little gags all aimed at those who are familiar enough with the series to turn to all their friends in a shared nudge of recognition . i wonder whether anyone who is coming in cold to the " trek " universe at this point would be anything but baffled and bored by what is going on . and what a waste of malcolm mcdowell , who could have been a great monomanical villain but should have been given a much more compelling reason for his obsession . there are plenty of details both scientific and of continuity to pick at , but to do so would be to ignore generations' major flaws . however , i would like to make one recommendation : seatbelts . no , i think the audience might need them more . this journey is one bumpy ride . 
screenplay : robert king . all right , all right , we get the point : despite all similarities to the best-selling story , speechless is * not * based on the romance between 1992 presidential campaign rivals james carville and mary matalin . in fact , the script was in development well before 1992 . no , it's not that the speechless twosome are speech writers , not campaign managers ; it's that carville and matalin's story is actually interesting . speechless is a limp , poorly structured would-be romantic comedy . the standard formula for a movie like speechless would have the two principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the end that they're crazy about each other . it's a noble attempt to shake things up , but unfortunately it just doesn't work . part of the fun of watching sparring in a romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the characters do , but in speechless they already know they're attracted to each other , and we're left with waiting for the campaign to end so they'll admit that they love each other already . there is such a herky-jerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even king's sharp dialogue can't prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour . inconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis and michael keaton , and with those performances most of their scenes together . the problems begin with their initial courtship , which does virtually nothing to establish julia's character and merely establishes that kevin is a wise-ass . davis is radiantly beautiful , and keaton is generally entertaining , but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter one bit . in a couple of scenes , like a quiet moment sitting at a fountain , they actually achieve some measure of connection . for the most part , however , they're just actors spouting lines . you keep waiting for a little spark , and it never happens . perhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechless's politics . the setting seems perfect for a high- energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix , but that's never the tone that underwood is going for . he wants a warm , fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaiman's flute-and-wind musical score , and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background . it might as well have been a story about rival grocers , and every single character is about as uninspired as he or she could possibly be . i was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert king's previous screenplay , the dana carvey flop clean slate , so i had some hopes for speechless . but while there is wit in the words , this is a script which was probably much better on paper . on screen , it's still paper thin . 
screenplay : deena goldstone . director : robert allan ackerman . films like safe passage have been a television staple for years . every once in a while , one will sneak its way onto the big screen , usually on the cachet of a big-name star or director ( a la ordinary people ) , and occasionally a great performance ( like kathy bates in 1993's a home of our own ) can turn tired material into something special . susan sarandon is a big name who turns in a great performance in safe passage , but even she can't save this mess . there are simply too many interchangeably troubled characters wandering around shouting at each other . and except for the remarkably well-adjusted twins , every one of them is working through some sort of neurosis or involved in the storyline in some way . there are simply too many characters bouncing around in safe passage , and director robert allan ackerman often seems like one of the reporters who appears at the singer house running after a quote . with writer deena goldstone , he has created characters who are little more than sound bites , and none of their problems seem to matter all that much . with this lack of focus comes the sense that no one making this movie really knew what it was supposed to be about . it's about all of these things , and it's about none of them . safe passage is filled with little snippets of development which run into infuriating dead ends , but there isn't really a point . mag seems to be developing a friendship with alfred's shy girlfriend , one which might establish a kind of parallel to her parenting , but it's only a footnote . patrick's vision problems seem to exist only to give sean astin's izzy something to worry about , and simon is confused , but no more confused than i was as i tried to figure out exactly why he even needed to be part of the story . safe passage simply needed about four fewer sons and a real identity for those that were included . it does have susan sarandon , though , and she makes up for a multitude of failings . but as good as she is , she isn't given a handle on who mag is , at least not one which can carry the film past its scattershot characterizations . a movie like safe passage , in which nothing really happens , depends on the development of strong characters to carry it through . safe passage is simply a collection of character mcnuggets . 
screenplay : ross thomas . director : damian harris . there is a trick to pulling off a neo-noir thriller like bad company successfully . many young filmmakers and screenwriters seem convinced that it's all about mood-drenched cinematography , or a suitably twisty-turny plot . the fact is that while those elements might give a film a healthy start , they can't really make anyone care about what's going on . john dahl ( red rock west , the last seduction ) has re-ignited interest in the genre , not simply because he knows how to push the right technical buttons , but because he weds a great story with interesting characters . bad company is loaded with double- and triple-crosses , but it's hard to care much because the characters are so flat and bored-looking . bad company is the kind of movie with tech credits so slick that for a while i was tricked into thinking i was watching a good movie . it's a good * looking * movie , to be certain , with great production design by andrew mcalpine ( the piano ) and glossy photography of vancouver locations by jack n . green ( unforgiven ) . there is also , of course , some steamy sex , and it may be bad company's strongest selling point . it's not that the sex is all that spectacular , but it is between barkin and fishburne , and it's almost unheard of for a hollywood movie to include an inter-racial relationship without being * about * the inter-racial relationship . it's easy to see why a studio would green light this story without fear of controversy , though : fishburne and barkin may be black and white , but they're barely human here . barkin , meanwhile , is even less interesting . she's supposed to be a sexy " ice queen , " but even a femme fatale needs some sort of personality . a subplot in which margaret tries to take grimes out with crowe's help seems primarily intended to give her something vaguely interesting to do , because as far as i could tell the real story could have taken place just as easily without her . in fact , there are so many dispassionate performances in bad company that spalding gray's turn as the neurotic ceo of the tool shed's main client looks like he got the only cup of coffee on the set that day . the plotting in ross thomas' screenplay is reasonably clever , an interesting look at post-cold war espionage as a growth industry . while there are plot twists aplenty , they never feel piled on , nor did i need a scorecard to keep up with who was screwing over whom . the problem with bad company isn't * what * happens , it's to * whom * it happens . it isn't always necessary for characters to be likable , and in a dark thriller it may not even be desirable , but they need to be more than robots whose sole function is moving the plot forward . laurence fishburne , ellen barkin and company are fine actors , but they couldn't manage to act interested in anything that their characters had to say or do . 
screenplay : max apple & stephen metcalfe . director : peter yates . it is a frequent but rather silly criticism leveled at certain hollywood films that they are " manipulative , " or push emotional buttons . it is silly because it is self-evident ; all art tries to make you feel a certain way , and movies are no exception . the real , unspoken criticism is that the movies targeted manipulate too obviously , and are usually specifically manipulating the audience towards a good cry . roommates is one of these awww-inspiring efforts , but it doesn't do the job . comprised of all the pieces that are supposed to work , roommates doesn't work because it lacks a cohesive story to complement peter falk's engaging performance . roommates seems like it could have been an interesting concept . generational conflict in film rarely involves characters separated by two generations , and there are very few films that deal with characters over 70 . make no mistake , falk's performance as rocky is entertaining ; he delivers his old world wisdom with wit and bite . but at a certain point , his characterization becomes caricature , just another grumpy old man who is one step ahead of his youngers . it is pleasant to watch rocky grow closer to his grandchildren , but it is less so to watch him grow progressively entombed in latex . the second , and far more glaring , problem is that the generational conflict angle is only a fraction of the story . when michael brings beth home , rocky makes no secret of his disapproval of pre-marital sex , and it is refreshing that his point of view is given a certain amount of respect by the filmmakers . a tense exchange between beth and rocky is very well handled by both julianne moore and falk , and highlights everything that was most promising about the idea for roommates . after a while , the plot jerks onto another tangent , this one spending far too much time focused on a custody battle and movie-of-the-week style family squabbling . that is a noble goal , but it simply does not work as a movie because there is never a clear enough sense of what this relationship is really supposed to be about . it certainly does not help that d . b . sweeney seems to be dazed and bored through most of the film's running time . roommates had the potential to be a warm and sentimental film , and for about half an hour it has the right tone of good-natured whimsy . but for over an hour , it is little more than a bad soap opera : drawn-out , confused and maudlin . 
screenplay : naomi foner . director : stephen gyllenhaal . it is one of film criticism's most ubiquitous put-downs--one i frequently use myself--to compare a theatrical feature to a tv-movie . such a description is intended to describe both subject matter ( usually topical or sensationalistic ) and manner of presentation ( usually didactic or sentimental ) . losing isaiah has garnered more tv-movie comparisons than i can count , but the comparison isn't entirely appropriate . but tv-movies generally feature one-dimensional characters and a specific agenda . losing isaiah features one-dimensional characters and a steadfast refusal to adopt a point of view . the subject of inter-racial adoption is a challenging and complex one , and no one would expect the makers of losing isaiah to deliver the final word on the matter . it isn't the absence of a patently obvious opinion from writer naomi foner and director stephen gyllenhaal which is the problem , but that there is only a cursory examination of any of the complexities involved . the inevitable court battle features the predictable array of speeches and finger-pointing , but none of these academic arguments are of much use to the audience . we need to see more of isaiah ( the adorable marc john jefferies ) interacting with the lewins , perhaps even being interviewed so his point-of-view could be understood . there is an attempt to deal with isaiah's state of mind in some very effective late scenes which show him responding to a new environment , but those scenes are too little , too late . similarly , the characters of margaret lewin and khaila richards are not characters so much as they are representatives of the two perspectives . the fact is , losing isaiah is far less about the lewins' life with isaiah than it is about khaila , whose redemption is the heart of the story . halle berry is impressive in the early scenes as khaila the addict , but in the film's later stages she becomes the 12-step version of the " hooker with the heart of gold , " too squeaky clean to be real . it seems to be the film's idea of balanced presentation not to give both mothers a character outside of their fierce conviction that the other one is wrong . stephen gyllenhaal's direction is usually best when no one is speaking . those scenes , and those from isaiah's perspective , suggest that if losing isaiah had been more intimate with its characters all the way through , the story could have worked . as it stands , a controversial subject becomes a minor plot device connecting the stories of two rather bland characters . losing isaiah's contrived ending is somehow appropriate for this wishy-washy effort . 
tank girl is a movie made for the " you just don't get it " crowd . there is a segment of the movie-going audience , mostly young and mostly male , whhich takes a certain contrarian pride i championing oddball genre flicks which are generally met with critical disdain or indifference . these are the movies which come to be known as " cult " favorites , and are treated as something of a barometer of hipness . this is what tank girl is almost certain to be , and i'll bet that the filmmakers are quite aware of it . part road warrior , part adventures of buckaroo banzai and part natural born killers , tank girl is sometimes quirky and fun , but just as often merely loud and sloppy . it is a hyper-kinetic piece of work that never seems to be taking itself at all seriously , from the comic book page stills that introduce several scenes to the goofy and diverse personalities of the supposedly ferocious rippers ( genetically altered human-kangaroo hybrids , designed by special effects make-up whiz stan winston ) . there is malcolm mcdowell , still resplendent in his spiky sting-at-50 hairdo from star trek : generations , playing a much livelier version of the same megalomaniac . there is one thing of which you can't accuse tank girl , and that is being conventional . what it can be accused of is not being nearly as clever as it is self-consciously different . tedi sarafian ( sister of terminal velocity director deran serafian ) has provided lori petty with a lot of one-liners , but none of them have any kick ; in fact , i can't recall a single piece of dialogue from the entire film . petty is a great cast as the tough and unflappable tank girl , but she has to carry far too much of the film with her cocky demeanor , because her supporting cast ( excluding mcdowell , whose part is really fairly small ) is unimpressive . tank girl , both the character and the film , have attitude to spare , but often little else . perhaps as much as anything , though , i was distracted by james r . symons trigger-happy editing which , combined with a soundtrack compiled by hole's courtney love-cobain , makes tank girl feel like a feature length version of mtv's " alternative nation . " entire sequences are composed of snippets of petty posing and doing cute little things , apparently aware of the camera . the battle sequences are a real weak link , particularly one in which two separate battles are cross-cut ineffectively . it was after about the tenth song , sometime before the headache started to set in , that i began to feel that tank girl was one of those movies that had been marketed , not made . i wanted to like tank girl , but i kept feeling that the filmmakers kept daring me not to like it , daring me to be un-hip . guilty as charged . 
screenplay : bryan goluboff . director : scott kalvert . all feature film directors who cut their teeth on music videos , please raise your hands . thank you for identifying yourselves ; now would you all please go away . your influence has to rank as one of the most annoying trends in filmmaking in the last decade , and it shows no sign of abating any time soon . it isn't just the strobe light quality of your twenty-cuts-per-minute editing , or the numbing over-use of popular music artists on the soundtracks which makes me suspicious of any film advertised " featuring the music of . . . " no , it is a kind of cynicism you have perfected , banking on the idea that no one will care about the lack of a story if you include enough bells and whistles . your adaptation of the basketball diaries is loud and one-dimensional , serving only as the vehicle for a performance by leonardo dicaprio that is better in pieces than it is as a whole . the basketball diaries has been bouncing around as a project for years , but the sticking point has always been that jim carroll as a character was too unsympathetic and too much a loner . as a film , the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as a cautionary tale , a 100 minute long " just say no " public service announcement , but as drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is impossible to care much about anyone in the movie . perhaps we are expected to see jim as one of those " good kids who falls in with the wrong crowd " that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be ; i saw him simply as part of the bad crowd . without a character who changes in any appreciable way , the basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into a collection of crimes committed by jim and his strung-out cohorts , all choreographed to an oppressively loud soundtrack . director scott kalvert doesn't have many scenes with intrinsic dramatic impact with which to work , so he substitutes silly slow-motion photography , self-consciously funky camera angles and choppy editing . mostly , they just draw attention to how hollow the story is . they also don't allow leonardo dicaprio's performance to be as strong as it could have been . for every impressive moment , like his desperate attempt to get his mother to give him money , there is a scene where kalvert pulls too much of the focus to his own camera theatrics . dicaprio is most effective when he is playing off other actors , particularly a fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an ex-junkie who tries to help jim straighten out , but kalvert won't let character interaction define this story . at isolate moments , the basketball diaries is a fine showcase for dicaprio's talents . far more frequently , it looks like kalvert is trying to imagine what a long form velvet underground video might have looked like . 
screenplay : david himmelstein . director : john carpenter . it's difficult to say whether it's a devoted core following or monumental chutzpah which accounts for john carpenter continuing to receive the possessory credit before his films . so seeing a film hyped as " john carpenter's village of the damned " doesn't exactly set my heart racing . and it's too bad , because as stylish as it is , village of the damned could have been a winner if not for some truly atrocious acting . even in his most uneven efforts , carpenter has demonstrated a great sense for how to use the screen . village of the damned is a typically impressive piece of visual direction , filled with subtly creepy scenes . there is one very nice split screen image after a key plot point , and a simmering level of menace in the scenes of the 7-year-old children in their paired marches . unlike carpenter's previous remake attempt , 1982's the thing , village of the damned doesn't rely on gruesome special effects in place of a well-constructed atmosphere . most of the time village of the damned has just the right feel . if only carpenter were as astute a judge of material and actors as he is of shot composition . narrative has never been one of carpenter's strengths , and the failure to include something as simple as a " 2 years later " caption makes for some unnecessarily awkward transitions . directing actors has also been a longtime problem for carpenter , jeff bridges' work in starman asside , but in village of the damned that problem is tripled by some mind-boggling casting choices . christopher reeve as the tragedy-stricken , intense hero ? or for that matter , as anything but a cartoon or video game voice-over these days ? the child actors are not much better , neither emotionless enough to be truly other-worldly or human enough to be the kind of " hidden threat among us " which can be so frightening . village of the damned almost pulls out a last second victory with a tense , well-staged climax , but it just isn't enough . it is a film with tone to spare , but like many of john carpenter's works , it could stand to trade some tone for a little substance . 
screenplay : susan minot . director : bernardo bertolucci . this is a film of false starts , dead ends and pointless distractions which pays too little attention to what should be its central premise . most of them are given some kind of romantic sub-plot -- just enough , in fact , to be genuinely annoying . bertolucci repeatedly cuts away in the middle of a scene to an irrelevant tangent , or introduces characters for a few superfluous moments . it is as though he is afraid that with all the drinking , dancing and baring of breasts going on , we in the audience will forget that there are also serious issues to be addressed . the problem is that it is always clear which of lucy's two missions is of greater interest to him , to the other characters in the film , and probably to us . there's nothing wrong with a simple , erotic coming-of-age story , but bertolucci appears to be embarrassed at the thought of making a film which is about something as base as the loss of virginity . it's truly a shame that bertolucci was unwilling to focus on that one story , because it provides a few touching moments . there are moments like that when lucy is every bit as beguiling as everyone in stealing beauty seems convinced that she is , but bertolucci still carries on as though he is above it all . he also makes that voyeuristic opening video sequence all the more telling . 
director : roland emmerich . whatever the production budget was for independence day , the marketing budget probably came close to matching it , and it appears to have worked . by all evidence , not a dime of it went to a good script doctor . by now , i am fully aware that the call for better scripts in summer blockbusters is a cry in the wilderness ; the success of twister has proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that little else matters if impressive visual effects are on the bill of fare . what makes independence day so frustrating is that its complete failure as a story does not appear to be the result of laziness . the half-dozen or so sub-plots which wind through independence day suggest that emmerich and devlin really wanted to make human drama matter . instead , they created a story full of one-dimensional characters , absurd coincidences and laughably uninteresting interpersonal conflicts . a couple of performances manage to rise above the nonsense -- will smith , who has far more charisma than this film deserves and is almost always entertaining when he is on-screen , which is not nearly often enough ; and brent spiner , who has fun as the eccentric scientist in charge of examining the remains of the infamous roswell , new mexico spacecraft from the 1950s -- but mostly there are forced emotions and nascent cliches like the bickering-estranged-spouses-who-still-love-each-other . but let's get down to the real business : at times , independence day looks great , a real apocalypse wow . the dog-fight sequences are complex and exciting , particularly a one-on-one battle between smith's capt . hiller and an alien fighter which whizzes through canyons at break-neck speed . at other times , believe it or not , it looks cheap . some of the digital effects are too soft around the edges , and independence day skimps on a face-to-face showdown with the aliens . that is a big mistake , because the only time in independence day when there is any genuine tension is when scientists get hold of -- and have to deal with -- an alien survivor . then again , a swarming alien ground invasion might have given emmerich and devlin just one more better film to crib from . even the film's self-promoted nickname , " id4 , " evokes terminator 2 : judgment day's " t2 " campaign from a few years ago . to top things off , the president gives what is intended to be a rousing address to his hopelessly outnumbered troops ; it was supposed to be his " st . crispin's day " speech , but it's so lame it makes you wondered how this guy was ever elected _class_ president . independence day appears to be the meticulously constructed result of one of those screenwriting programs which are supposed to give you all the elements for a complete story . . . and of course , all those elements come from other films . you can't buy inspiration , and independence day is woefully short on anything that rouses the imagination . it's a kick-ass trailer that's wagging a dog . 
screenplay : sonke wortmann . director : sonke wortmann . of all the things i might claim to understand about movies , i suspect that what makes a given film popular with american audiences will never be one of them . with that in mind , what makes a film popular with non-american audiences ranks somewhere with " what is the sound of one hand clapping " on my personal scale of philosophical inscrutability . many is the film which has come to these shores trumpeted as " one of the most popular films ever in ( fill-in-native-country ) , and it seems that for every once were warriors ( a record-breaker in new zealand ) there is a the mystery of rampo ( last year's japanese smash which turned out to be a bit of psychedelic soft-core porn ) . not ( " die bewegte mann " in europe ) , a silly and fairly aimless sex farce which provides a sexy star with very little to do . as it turns out , norbert is also just as interested in axel , and makes his intentions quite apparent . writer/director sonke wortmann has created an erratic comedy which swings back and forth from being an airy trifle to half-heartedly attempting genuine character development . the opening twenty minutes promise plenty of broad laughs , from doro's discovery of axel and a lady-friend in a bathroom stall to waltraud's frantic attempts to look remove his drag costume so as not to scare off axel . it appears as though wortmann is setting up some lessons for our two protagonists to learn from each other -- norbert will learn to make better romantic choices , and axel will become a more faithful partner to doro . then maybe . . . maybe not makes a jarring u-turn back to unapologetic , bawdy slapstick , and throws any pretense at character out the window . that wouldn't necessarily be a problem , particularly because the character developments were looking fairly obvious , except that the comic situations of the last half hour are equally obvious , and not very funny . wortmann directs it all with a sluggish inevitability , and takes a final turn back to sentimentality which suggests that he was just making the whole thing up as he went along . the chiseled-cheeked schweiger has become a superstar in germany as a result of this role , and outside of his obvious sex appeal , i can't quite see why . he tries to give axel a boyish charm to counteract his incomprehensible shifts in personality , but he is the prototype pretty face with little spark . similarly , joachim krol's award-winning role seems remarkably shallow , and shows that america doesn't have a monopoly on befuddling acting honors . the problem i had with both roles , and with maybe . . . maybe not as a whole , was that there seemed to be no point to any of it , no growth of character , and some unappealing messages . every male character is perpetually horny , axel is just as big a jerk when the film ends as he was when it started , and we are reassured that everything will be fine because doro will continue to be a door-mat and forgive axel's philandering yet again . perhaps it's just a cultural gap i was unable to cross , but maybe . . . maybe not struck me as only sporadically amusing , and sometimes flat-out irritating . which is why i will never make my living deciding what movies get made . 
screenplay : james demonaco , gary nadeau . director : francis ford coppola . once upon a time , francis ford coppola was one of the most revered directors in the world , the creator of classic films like the godfather , the godfather part 2 and the conversation , part of an american renaissance of the 1970s which included names like scorsese , spielberg and altman . then came films which politely could be called ambitious failures -- one from the heart , the cotton club , tucker : the man and his dream -- and mixed critical reception for his third godfather film and bram stoker's dracula . it has been four years since dracula , more time to wonder if coppola could once again summon that special something . what he has summoned instead is jack , a frustrating patchwork of slapstick and sentimentality in which almost everything feels forced . at least that's what i think he learns . one of the reasons jack feels so muddled is that it is a film without a clear sense of who its vibrant character is . at other times it appears that jack is supposed to be the character who is meant to change ; he too gets a heartfelt and inspiring speech . diane lane doesn't get a heartfelt and inspiring speech , just plenty of heartfelt looks to tell us that she is learning to be less protective of jack . there is no law which states that only one character in a film can change , but we have to know with whom we are meant to identify , and coppola spends so much time being heartfelt that he fails to provide a definite protagonist . that leaves jack as a message film in which there is no clear message . jack will quite naturally inspire a great deal of comparison to 1988's big , but big was a pure fantasy which never felt the need to underline its lessons . coppola and screenwriters james demonaco and gary nadeau try to incorporate scenes of boys-will-be-boys playfulness ( and who among us hasn't been initiated into a club by lighting our bodily gases or eating disgusting food mixtures ) , as if to tell us " we're just having fun here . " that might be easier to accept if they hadn't also overwhelmed simple moments like jack calculating his mortality with the uberdramatic voice-over , " what do i want to be when i grow up ? jack's ace-in-the-hole would seem to be never-quite-grown-up robin williams in the lead role , but there is something about his performance which feels uncertain . admittedly it is an extremely challenging part -- he's playing not just a 10-year-old , but a maladjusted 10-year-old -- but williams more often seems to be acting like a 6-year-old , just a step away from the baby-talk character he often used in his stand-up comedy routines , while his 10-year-old co-stars often act like they're 16 . coppola certainly knows how to make a good-looking film , with some clever touches like shots of jack's light-up sneakers . but jack usually comes off as sentiment without sense , and comedy without a foundation . once upon a time , francis ford coppola appeared to know all there was to know about making movies . 
there is nothing quite as sad for someone who loves movies as watching a rookie film-maker who really wants to say something , but turns out not to have very much to say , or appears unable to say it in a way that connects . she has a sundance institute-approved screenplay , and all the studied quirkiness she can fit into 89 minutes . but krueger has created a predictable story with characters who still look like they exist on 3x5 notecards on her desk . manny & lo is a comedy-drama without enough of either . i suppose one of the things which irritated me most about manny & lo is that for an ostensibly original independent film , its basic premise has been done and done and done again . as comedy , think of ruthless people ; as social drama , think of last year's white man's burden . and those are just recent examples of stories which make the very psych 101 observation that kidnapers and their hostages aren't always so different , and sometimes bond to fulfill their respective needs . manny & lo doesn't offer much of a twist on the movie truism that if the plot is about a kidnapping , abductors and abducted will go from antagonism to uneasy truce to friendship . there wasn't a moment when i didn't know exactly where krueger was taking me . mary kay place , a much more experienced performer , turns elaine into something intriguing almost in spite of krueger . i think there is a tendency to give first-timers the benefit of the doubt on independent projects like this , because critics are usually aware of the limitations of time and money . i'm not sure that any of that matters to the audience . lisa krueger's intentions are good ; she wants to explore what can make a dysfunctional family functional , and how whether or not you perceived your family as dysfunctional can determine the effect it has on you . she also leaves threads dangling , introduces characters who do little or nothing to advance the story ( like cameron boyd as the terribly cute chuck , who hands out his signature to manny ) , and doesn't direct her script with an eye to making either the humor or the relationships as effective as they might have been . manny & lo is a slow , rather simple and not terribly entertaining film , and that doesn't change because krueger is inexperienced , or a woman , or not working for a major studio . 
screenplay : lee david zlotoff . director : lee david zlotoff . maybe they smelled a female-appeal hit like fried green tomatoes ; maybe they liked the idea of countering the hollywood filth-monger mentality by supporting a film produced by clergy ; maybe , just maybe , they were genuinely touched by the story . whatever the reason , they have themselves a film which doesn't just jerk tears -- it slaps , kicks , pinches and pleads for them . the spitfire grill may be positive and uplifting , but it is so aggressive in the pursuit of your sympathy that it becomes exhausting . on its most basic level , the spitfire grill is yet another in a long line of films about benevolent strangers who teach intransigent folks a lesson in tolerance , and again the lead character is perhaps the most troubled , but not really the character who grows and changes . she is the sympathetic core of the film , and we grow to care about whether she will be able to find redemption . unfortunately , we never get to see her experience that redemption , and it is something of a cheat . it is never nearly as important to us that hannah makes peace with her demons , or that nahum learns to be accepting , or that any particular person ends up with the grill , but those are the only scraps we are tossed to give the spitfire grill any sense of consequence . in place of consequence , writer/director lee david zlotoff provides a film which often feels like a string of feel-good cliches , scored by james horner , the master of feel-good cliche music . zlotoff never misses the opportunity to send out scenes like tear-seeking missiles , scenes which might have been effective individually but en masse serve only to batter you insensible . if my description seems cruelly cynical , it is only because the spitfire grill numbs you with its pathos . in its own way , it is just as shallow as an action film which is just one explosion after another . the story goes that the spitfire grill was " commissioned " by a collective of catholic priests who wanted to back a film with " positive human values , " and i suppose you could say that they got what they ordered . everyone in gilead eventually does the right thing , and it is the kind of film which will probably end up on bob dole's hit parade . but in the course of injecting those human values , lee david zlotoff didn't bother to inject many human beings -- gilead , maine and nearly everyone in it ( particularly the terminally irrascible hannah ) seems plucked from a pepperidge farm commercial . alison elliott's performance is strong enough that , for a while , you might think the spitfire grill is about something , but it isn't about people whose troubles make you emotional . it's more of an endurance contest between you and your supply of facial tissues . 
i suppose one cannot dismiss " star search " as an utter vacuum in the history of entertainment if it gave us sinbad . you may or may not recall that the comedian formerly known as david adkins got his big break by winning the comedy competition of the now-defunct talent contest a decade or so ago , and that's almost enough to make up for giving us carrot top . it's hard to explain my inordinate fondness for sinbad , except to note that i also loved bill cosby's stand-up , and i think of sinbad as cosby's natural successor in the same way eddie murphy can be considered richard pryor's . sinbad works clean _and_ funny , and he strikes me as an incredibly decent person besides . i have always believed that some day he would justify my faith by making a great film comedy . but first kid is not it . and it's not just a formula film , it's a formula film aimed at kids , which means that clever banter is never used to establish the antagonism where a pratfall , a bare backside or plenty of messy food can be used in its place . mind you , the film seemed to be perfectly hilarious to the kids in the audience , although i can't for the life of me understand why a film aimed at 12-year-olds included a cameo by sonny bono . still , as grossly predictable as first kid is , i still found myself smiling a lot at sinbad . i think he is the perfect star for a children's film , because there is something wonderfully warm and open about his screen persona . despite standing 6'5 " , sinbad is more of an over-sized teddy bear than an intimidating physical presence , and every time he grins , it seems completely genuine . he has precious little to work with in first kid -- a bland mentor ( robert guillaume ) , an even blander president ( james naughton ) -- but the sheer force of his good nature keeps you hoping something will come along and be deserving . unfortunately , he is stuck playing with brock pierce , who is pleasant enough as the timid , self-conscious luke but doesn't have the spark to convince us he could be obnoxious enough to irritate anyone . i might not have had a real problem with first kid if screenwriter tim kelleher and director david mickey evans had done what it appeared they were initially intending to do , which is to tell a simple , harmless , goofy buddy story with lots of physical comedy for kids . however , they make a big mistake by turning the conclusion into a suspense drama involving an attempted kidnapping of luke ( extra credit points in cinematic obviousness 101 if you can guess the kidnapper just from my review ) . they seem to feel that it is necessary to show simms as a good agent as well as a good guy , and that is fine , but the gunplay which ensues is a bit too serious , making the last fifteen minutes somewhat inappropriate for young children . far better to give sinbad the opportunity to take over the film , since he was clearly the best thing they had going for them . first kid is not an unpleasant film , it's just a blatantly unnecessary one . ed mcmahon would not approve . 
screenplay : steven baigelman . director : steven baigelman . i can't recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota . for forty minutes or so , i was lured into a loopy if occasionally over-wrought romantic comedy , and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt . then , rather suddenly , i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence ; shortly thereafter , i was whacked in the gut by another . feeling minnesota is a film that made me feel violated , as though i had trusted writer-director steven baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face . the wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments , most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin . you would have every reason to expect that relationships -- both familial and romantic -- would be the focal point of feeling minnesota . unfortunately , you would be dead wrong . i suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding , but i certainly didn't expect what i got . what i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality , or rather creating gags about brutality . the sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another , but there is no consistency to the characterizations . vincent d'onofrio turns in a manic performance as sam , whose jealousy , competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks , while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction , and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood . there are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully ( jonathan demme's something wild and neil jordan's the crying game come to mind ) , but they didn't try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment . i don't want to dismiss baigelman's successes out of hand -- he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop , and some well-crafted comic moments -- and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as a light-hearted caper . it _is_ his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value , and that he can't make his two halves into a whole . feeling minnesota left me feeling used , and there's not much funny about that . 
screenplay : walter hill . director : walter hill . running time : 100 minutes . depending on your degree of cinematic acumen , last man standing is either a ) a prohibition-era remake of akira kurosawa's 1961 classic yojimbo ; b ) a prohibition-era remake of sergio leone's 1964 classic a fistful of dollars ; c ) a prohibition-era action drama with a completely original story-line . new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category ( c ) than in the other two combined , much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons . the fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing , which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the _real_ source material , the dashiell hammett novel _red harvest_ . it also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself . viewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint , and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes-cum-bastardizations . director walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids , including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity , but at least he doesn't try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture . what he _does_ do is nearly as big a mistake , and that is to provide a running voice-over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard-boiled style of pulp detective fiction . yes , that narration is full of cliches , but those are are not particularly troubling . the problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters . they were a mystery , to the other characters in the film and to the audience , their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted , and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status . it feels like a hammett novel , all right , and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice , but it simply doesn't work . even if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate , i can't imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction . willis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith , but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else . christopher walken plays doyle's brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft-spoken psychos , and there isn't another single character whom makes even the slightest impression . with no compelling antagonist for smith , there is no build-up towards the expected showdown , and when it does come , that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about . cinematographer lloyd ahern ( who also did the only noteworthy work on hill's 1995 flop wild bill ) creates some nifty sunburned vistas , but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter-productive narration . sometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original , they'll wonder what all the talk was about . in the case of last man standing , it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about . 
accompanying the press materials for curdled were a few newspaper and magazine articles about actual services which clean up violent crime scenes , services like the one which is a key part of the film's premise . if you want a sure sign of an insecure rookie film-maker , that would be it . i suppose the idea is to impress upon us the real-world foundation of the story , but i simply don't care ; an adept film-maker can sell me his premise over the course of his film . what the articles really tell me is that director and co-writer reb braddock found the concept for curdled in real life , and what the rest of the film tells me is that he didn't quite know what to do with it . for a while , curdled is perversely interesting simply because gabriela is such a unique character . she understands enough to know that other people will not consider her obsession normal , but her enthusiasm makes it difficult for her to contain herself , making for some uncomfortable moments with a potential romantic interest ( bruce ramsay ) and with her co-workers . the black humor in the script by braddock and john maass comes from watching jones' off-beat performance as a woman who shows a wide-eyed glee at being right where dark deeds were done . however , even that bit of character development is subverted for a cheap , easy gag . curdled seems to bounce from realism to surrealism with a capricious indifference . ultimately , this confusion points to a director who does not seem to be in control of his material or his characters . there is a lot going on at various points in curdled , but none of it leads anywhere : the central character doesn't grow , there is no real sub-text about human nature , and there is not even a consistent tone to allow it to work as a cathartic genre picture . it is evident that braddock grabbed on to a basic situation with potential , and that he was able to create an intriguing central character to place in that situation , but that he just didn't know where to go from there . curdled sports a few neat stylistic flourishes , including an eye-catching opening title sequence and a great scene where gabriela does a sensuous dance around a murder scene , but for the most part it is just one big , long , sick joke with a punch line that is not particularly worth the effort . someone should have thought about telling a story , instead of just mailing one . 
screenplay : robert locash , pat proft , jerry zucker . producers : jerry zucker , pat proft , gil netter . starring : jon lovitz , tia carrere , mekhi phifer , louise fletcher , malinda williams , guillermo diaz . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity ) running time : 86 minutes . the naked gun ) that it misses one of its most obvious gags : there is nary a " dick clark " gag to be found . obviousness was never really an issue for the zuckers , because their modus operandi was a non-stop assault of puns , pratfalls and pop culture references , allowing every dud joke to be swallowed up by the next one in line . high school high doesn't seem to have time for that kind of comic machine-gunning , because it is too busy with -- of all things -- a plot . and this is that rarity among contemporary films , one which needs less plot instead of more . high school high was directed by erstwhile b-actor and pcu director hart bochner , and he shows little aptitude for the kind of frame-filling humor which characterized other zucker parodies . nearly every gag is front and center here , providing little incentive to scour the background for throwaway bits . on the rare occasion when a joke is tucked away for discovery -- like a sign in a topless bar-cum-theater which promises " next week : all-nude ibsen " -- it is like a gift . too much of the time , however , writers zucker , pat proft and robert locash measure out the laughs as though aware that there aren't that many to go around . they also can't seem to decide what kind of laughs they are going for . i'm not going to suggest that low humor hasn't always played a significant role in zucker films , since they were inspired largely by mad magazine , but there was usually the sense that they were writing dumb comedy for smart people , jackhammer-subtle but intricately absurdist . high school high is not nearly as clever , aiming many of its gags at the same audience which tri-star is targeting with a hip-hop-heavy soundtrack . the number of jokes aimed at gays or lesbians runs in the high teens ; the over-use or mis-use of urban slang runs a close second . the dependence on a soundtrack and the surprisingly straight-forward narrative often make high school high feel less like a parody of dangerous minds than a slightly more amusing remake of dangerous minds . actually , in some ways it resembles this year's the substitute even more , with its sub-plot of drug dealing and administrative complicity , but the substitute was a more subversive film . high school high is not nearly hard enough on the cliched movies made for and about urban youth , perhaps afraid of insulting its own audience . with its cast a combination of comic actors like lovitz and dramatic actors like fletcher and phifer , high school high slides uncomfortably between mockery and schlockery . the surest sign of high school high's spartan comedy is that it almost isn't worth staying through the closing credits , where the zuckers usually tossed off half a dozen silly little references . it's just a basic crawl this time , which also sums up the pace of the film rather nicely . 
yet the chamber depends on such warm fuzziness when it comes to matters of race , because its thinking is equally fuzzy . it is one of the chamber's many bits of convenient ignorance that adam makes his plea with absolute earnestness , despite the fact that his own father suffered and struggled not to turn out like sam . of course , it may be that chris o'donnell knew no other way to make that speech , because earnestness is the only emotional pitch in which he seems capable of performing . the chamber may toss around ideas about racism , the politics of criminal justice and corruption in high places -- all pet peeves of grisham's , if his oeuvre is any indication -- but ultimately it really comes down to the face-offs between hackman and o'donnell , and man oh man but o'donnell is wrestling out of his weight class . there may be no more inconsequential actor in american films than chris o'donnell , a pretty boy who makes you want to re-evaluate keanu reeves as a multi-shaded thespian . then there is gene hackman , an actor with the ability to make you sit through nonsense like this just for the chance to watch him do his thing . it is a really little more than a piece of anti-death penalty propaganda , but hackman sells it with such conservation of emotion that it doesn't feel as obvious as it should . he makes that speech a statement about the feelings of his character , which is the mark of a superior actor : the words he speaks are his . films about condemned killers have been all the rage lately , but the chamber is both the most weightless and the most subtly offensive of them all , because it is so disingenuous in its portrayal of sam . 
screenplay : leo benvenuti & steve rudnick and timothy harris & herschel weingrod . director : joe pytka . mpaa rating : pg ( mild profanity , adult humor ) . running time : 85 minutes . jordan is a superstar in an era where the line between entertainment and marketing is more like a faint smudge , and space jam is a film which defines the state of the art in tie-ins : action figures , happy meals , clothing , soundtrack albums and on and on and on . that kind of emphasis on merchandising made it a long shot for artistic merit , but i hoped the looney tunes could make for some genuine lunacy . no such luck , doc . space jam is a sporadically amusing cartoon for a rapid-edit audience with too little of the classic warner wit . anyone who has seen michael jordan in any of his several thousand commercial appearances ( mcdonald's , gatorade , nike , hanes ) should not be surprised to hear that he has very little screen presence . jordan has exactly one facial expression when trying to act -- eyebrows raised , lips pursed in a wrinkled smirk -- and he runs the gamut of emotions from affable bemusement to amiable bemusement . that makes it challenging enough for him to work with another human actor , weighing down an otherwise amusing scene where a star-struck catcher feeds jordan information about what pitches to expect . when he is expected to react to animated characters , he is utterly lost . it isn't that much of the comedy involves interaction between jordan and the 'tunes ; mostly he is asked to be pleasant and dunk in slow motion . there just seems to be no particular reason why jordan couldn't have been animated himself , where an artist could have made him more . . . well , animated . make no mistake , space jam is going to be entertaining to 10-year-olds , relying on the slapstick violence which has always characterized looney tunes . what's missing is the subversive , adult-oriented humor of the looney tunes of old , and not " adult-oriented " in the sense that it was crude . the classic warners cartoon capers took the time to build both visual and verbal gags , but director joe pytka doesn't believe his audience will have that kind of patience . space jam's idea of sharp satire is a reference to the disney-owned mighty ducks nhl franchise , and it is disspiriting to find the 'tunes scraping for laughs by uttering lines like " nice butt , " or " we're getting screwed . " it also seems strangely appropriate that bugs bunny is voiced by billy west ; with its bodily functions humor , space jam seems less like a vehicle for bugs than one for west's other cartoon voice roles , ren and stimpy . murray's comic persona is the human descendent of bugs bunny , a wiseacre rebel unfairly smarter than his adversaries , and he is a riot in his scant minutes . space jam is a commercial construct , and it feels like it . how sad that a brilliant comic creation like bugs bunny has to ride shotgun with a wooden basketball star , all to provide a set of collector's cups . 
writers are smacked around so often and with such impunity in hollywood that it is perfectly understandable when a writer insists on directing his or her own material . it similarly makes sense , i suppose , for a playwright to want to direct the film adaptation of his own material , and herb gardner has been unusually protective of his plays . in 1986 , he directed his own adaptation of the goodbye people ; in 1996 , he directed his own adaptation of i'm not rappaport . clearly gardner is attached to his creations . in fact , he is far too attached . another director might have identified i'm not rappaport as a meandering play with one interesting idea , and given it the good tightening up it needed . gardner clings to every line and situation , turning out a sluggish and repetitive meditation on aging . i'm not rappaport is about a man's attempt to retain his dignity in spite of advancing years , and there are strong possibilities in the character of nat . walter matthau and ossie davis both give solid performances , obviously appreciating their own opportunities in rare leading roles , and there is an affecting sincerity to their comments about giving respect where it is due . that scene between nat , midge and danforth is noteworthy not just because it is the best one in i'm not rappaport , but also because it says everything gardner has to say that is worth saying . the relationships are not compelling enough by themselves to carry those scenes , and the point that seniors are under-estimated and mis-treated is made and made and made again . as i'm not rappaport wanders through the last of its 133 minutes , you may begin to feel that you have been sitting in your seat as long as its main characters have been alive . worse still , it leaves us with the depressing notion that the elderly should be seen and not heard . gardner didn't need to take us through over two hours of hoops just so that we could end up right where we started . well-intentioned and well-acted though it might be , i'm not rappaport is the product of a writer too married to every word , and a director too sparing with the knife . 
producers : dmitri villard , richard attenborough . director : richard attenborough . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , adult situations ) running time : 110 minutes . in love and war , a thoroughly mediocre attempt at an intimate epic , suffers the added disadvantage of extraordinarily bad timing . that is not to say that in love and war would have been a better film if it had been released a year ago . it does mean , however , that the points of comparison between this film and its two predecessors make its weaknesses all the more evident . and he never lets you forget it for a moment , either , trotting out spectacular locations , battlefield footage and a grandiose score by george fenton . unfortunately , the locations are shot flatly by roger pratt , a couple of the battlefield scenes are dropped in like sympathy-seeking mortars without a moment of set-up , and fenton's score is as loud and relentless as any theater's sub-woofers could withstand . sweeping characters like this aside doesn't take a particular strong broom , as it turns out . after failing to provide the grandeur of the english patient , in love and war then can't muster the kind of convincing characterizations which at least made the whole wide world watchable . sandra bullock is capable of making agnes somewhat appealing , and of lending a modicum of plausibility to the script's portrayal of her as the most fought-over female creature since helen of troy . as for chris o'donnell . . . well , don't you just want to pat him on the head and send him to bed with a glass of milk ? you half expect " mrs . robinson " to start playing on the soundtrack . o'donnell is even worse trying to play the disillusioned sot hemingway becomes , when his raging outbursts seem more like petulant hissy fits , but by that point no one in the audience will care much about him anyway . as an indication of how inconsequential the central romance between agnes and ernie is , in love and war actually gains momentum during the half an hour of screen time when the focus turns to agnes' relationship with dr . caraciolo . the venice locations create a glowing romantic setting , and bonucci turns in a nice performance as the stiffly chivalric suitor . o'donnell's ernie is about as lusty as cub reporter jimmy olsen , and in love and war is reduced to its familiarity -- an epic drama with no drama , and a personal story with no personality . 
i have to give this to meet wally sparks : if you've ever seen rodney dangerfield before , you're going to get exactly what you expect , and if you've never seen rodney dangerfield before , you have no business being in the theater . dangerfield isn't an actor ; he isn't even a personality . he is a persona , a leering 70-year-old adolescent who has parlayed not getting any respect into a career most entertainers would envy . the irony in the dangerfield persona is that he has in fact gained respect , or at least appreciation , from a generation of young comedians . meet wally sparks turns out not to be simply a vehicle for dangerfield to do his schtick , but a great big tribute in his honor , a dopey but almost reverent celebration of rodney at his rodney-est . dangerfield plays wally sparks , the host of a tabloid talk show which has developed a reputation for being the sleaziest example of a sleazy genre . meet wally sparks is an extremely busy movie , which is not the same as saying that a lot happens . even the most die-hard dangerfield fan must admit that a little bit of rodney goes a long way , and the script seems almost desperate to provide sub-plots which will allow the star to take a breather . there really isn't any point to any of it , except to pad the running time , and at 106 minutes it certainly feels padded . when it all wraps up -- with a wedding , no less -- there are going to be a lot of numb buttocks in the theater . i'm not really sure why the even bothered with a plot at all , since it's all about rodney . the 25 minutes which take place at the governor's fund-raiser set the tone , as wally wanders through high society like an even more lecherous groucho marx , a walking punch line in search of a straight line to a gag about sexual potency , sexual frequency , sexual organs or just good old-fashioned sex . it is so obvious rodney's world that it is almost a shock when anyone else gets a joke ( the pratfalls to which stiers , roche and others are subjected notwithstanding ) . or at least taps them over . there are a couple of genuinely funny bits in meet wally sparks -- in one , wally inadvertently breaks the genitalia off a male nude statue , then does a very bad job of hiding it in his pocket -- but this isn't a film built around comedic creativity . on the contrary , it is a tribute to comedic venerability , like a henny youngman performance with half the audience providing the obvious and familiar double entendre before rodney can . the film is so self-aware on that point that wally's son gets one scene in which _he_ anticipates the joke and mouths the punch line . it's all terribly dumb and predictable , but it doesn't matter to anyone involved because this is less a rodney dangerfield film than " rodney dangerfield : this is your life , " with a host of guest stars turning up to honor the star : jay leno , roseanne , tim allen , bob saget . tony danza and michael bolton even turn up to do dangerfield impressions , and if you think you've seen it all , you haven't until you've seen michael bolton do dangerfield . meet wally sparks is likely to be a snooze to anyone who is not arriving similarly to worship at the altar of rodney . it is a strange experience watching a movie where everyone in the film , perhaps hoping for dangerfield's personal benediction of " hey , kid , you're all right , " seems more interested in entertaining the star than in entertaining the audience . 
producers : clint eastwood , karen spiegel . director : clint eastwood . when we first encounter luther whitney ( clint eastwood ) in absolute power , he is sitting in an art gallery sketching hands and eyes from paintings in one of those slow , silent moments characteristic of an eastwood-directed film . at that moment , you may be tempted to break into a slight smile , impressed that eastwood has merely fleshed out his character under the guise of plot development . perhaps , you think , this won't be just another plot-driven conspiracy thriller . perhaps three-dimensional characters are going to make it something special . just wait sixty seconds . luther manages to escape , but the president's people know there was a witness . almost any other director would have taken this material and made it a big , dumb hollywood thriller -- and frankly , that probably would have been the best thing for it . eastwood is a director with a precise control over the details of his films , but in absolute power he spends so much time fussing over those details that he fails to notice that the story is completely absurd . while eastwood is able to construct clockwork sequences like an ambush at a coffee shop , he doesn't seem to care that , like much of what goes on in absolute power , it is resolved through pure coincidence . even the casting manages to get in the way , specifically the casting of hackman as richmond . the press notes for absolute power boast of hackman's career that " there is no such thing as a 'gene hackman role , ' " but that simply isn't true . it is also hard to figure out how the pathetic , libidinous drunkard of that opening scene becomes the take-charge whip-cracker , or why his press conference in support of his grieving friend sullivan demonstrates such a lousy poker face you wonder what kind of politician this guy could possibly be . the script , by the legendary william goldman , does offer a few nice touches and typically snappy dialogue , and ed harris plays the detective investigating the murder as a courtly and respectful spin on the usual foul-mouthed cop . when a central character seems to be a different person from scene to scene , however , those little details lose a lot of their charm . that brings us to eastwood's luther whitney , as baffling a screen character as i can recall . eastwood's acting has grown more interesting with the passing years , more relaxed and subtle , but he has devoted nearly every ounce of energy in the creation of absolute power to making his own character sympathetic . never mind that before that scene we had no indication that whitney even knew the man in the sullivan house was the president ; in fact , the scene plays funnier and more interesting if whitney is such a recluse that he doesn't even know what the president looks like . but everything is subjugated to giving luther the moral high ground , making him a doting father and a good citizen with a handful of quirky traits . i'm willing to grant the conceit that whitney is a master of disguise even though it doesn't seem particularly necessary for a sneak thief -- maybe he needed a hobby when he tired of sketching the old masters in the smithsonian -- but absolute power lost me when it became clear that this man who could disarm any security system in the world couldn't program a vcr for his alibi . 
somewhere along the line , the makers of romantic comedies stopped caring about whether their lead characters had any business being together . perhaps in response to the complex ritual late-20th-century courtship has become , audiences began to embrace film romances which had as much to do with sorcery as chemistry -- sleepless in seattle , four weddings and a funeral -- and film-makers have been only too happy to provide more of the same . the fairy tale , a perfectly enjoyable expression of our dreams , is no longer simply a supplement to realistic love in the movies ; it practically has replaced it entirely . fools rush in is the next logical step in the transformation of screen romance into a celebration of fate . perhaps more than the audience can withstand , as well . fools rush in scripter katherine reback doesn't provide one really interesting conflict between alex and isabel -- she provides a dozen moderately diverting conflicts , with characters who are on screen barely long enough for you to remember their names . there is so much quarreling and scowling and meddling and fretting going on from so many different directions that you might find yourself wondering if you have forgotten how perfect they are supposed to be for each other . don't worry , you haven't forgotten . all evidence suggests that the only thing right in the relationship between alex and isabel is really great sex , and i am not discounting the value of really great sex when i say that it's not nearly enough . fools rush in belongs to that class of romantic comedies which demands that you accept the central pairing as celestially foretold , and curse you for a fuddy-duddy with no sense of romance if you object , as john cleese once did in a classic " cheers " episode , that the only thing opposites attract is divorce . what makes fools rush in all the more frustrating is that there are plenty of moments when it is tremendously entertaining . you don't need to be a fan of " friends " to appreciate perry , who can fire darts of sarcasm and do reaction takes with the best of them . he can be both funny and warm , as he is in an appealing sequence at a fuentes family gathering , and it is easy to feel sympathetic towards alex despite his near-sighted careerism . salma hayek is also quite good , conveying conflicted emotions and frustration , and there is certainly heat between perry and hayek ( although , let's face it , hayek could generate heat in a room full of asbestos ) . but fools rush in needs more than heat . it needs a heart , a sense of connection which comes from friendship as much as fantasy . in a film which throws so many problems and situations at the screen that nothing sticks together , it is ironic that the only thing which does stick together -- alex and isabel -- probably shouldn't . 
mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 101 minutes . i'll give this to paul thomas anderson : he's got a sense of atmosphere . hard eight , anderson's feature writing and directing debut , may be even more successful than leaving las vegas at making casinos look ugly , and his characters exchange dialogue as though every word had to be yanked out of them with pliers . that's the good news . the bad news is that hard eight is yet another frustrating independent film by a rookie film-maker who has an idea of what his film should be _like_ without having an idea of what it should be _about_ . though generally well-acted and interesting to look at , hard eight is more a collection of thematic ideas than a story . an extended sequence during the first half hour of hard eight might lead you to believe that the film is going to be a revelatory study of the gambling culture . it is an interesting lesson in deception -- as is a later instruction on how to steal pay-per-view movies which could send hotels all across america scrambling to cover themselves -- which gives hard eight a welcome sense of authenticity . that sociological curiosity factor isn't enough to sustain a film , though , and sooner or later anderson has to get down to the business of examining the relationships between these characters . at least he should have , but he never does . we see far too little of sidney and john together to get a sense of their friendship , making the significant revelations to come ring totally false . we get a chance to see him in a variety of situations -- playing the big shot at a craps table , cleaning up after john's messes , showing kindness to waitress/hooker clementine ( a thanklessly unpleasant role for paltrow ) -- without really giving us a sense of who he is , as though anderson thinks teasing us with a dark past is sufficient . it's not . every once in a while , hard eight breaks out of its languid stupor long enough for some gratuitous violence , a half-hearted attempt at fooling the audience into thinking something is happening . every time , it doesn't take long for the film to settle back into a bleak somnambulism . jackson's profanity-laced tirades are entertaining to a point , but it soon becomes clear that he's merely recycling riffs from pulp fiction's jules because there isn't anything here on which he can base a unique character . he's not really a character at all here ; he's a plot device , someone who turns up when it's necessary for something to happen . a number of things happen in hard eight , but none of it adds up to a narrative we should care about . hard eight is evocative but thoroughly unsatisfying , a film in which an oppressive atmosphere of foreboding is the real central character , crushing the human characters like empty beer cans . 
screenplay : bruce a . evans and raynold gideon . director : john pasquin . mpaa rating : pg ( mild profanity , adult themes ) running time : 110 minutes . whenever film fans learn of plans by an american studio to re-make a foreign language film , the common reaction is a collective cringe . wonderful foreign films like the vanishing and diabolique have been turned into big-budget garbage , as hollywood tends to grab on to a plot without grasping the point . the 1996 american theatrical release of little indian inspired some of the most savage reviews of the year , making the prospect of the disney-fied version jungle 2 jungle almost too much to bear . hollywood could only improve on the original this time around , but it hasn't improved enough . jungle 2 jungle is a dopey and predictable family comedy which could be thought of as disappointing , if not for the wretchedness of the source material . yes , you read correctly , the russian mafia . there is a lot of going on to keep everyone busy , but even at its busiest jungle 2 jungle simply isn't funny very often . it sometimes seems as though most of the film was transcribed from 10-year-old jerry seinfeld routines . it's hard to believe that after waiting over two years to follow up his $144 million film debut in the santa clause , tim allen decided this was the script he couldn't pass up . jungle 2 jungle doesn't give him nearly as much good material , relying on standard fish-out-of-water scenarios -- mimi siku dines on cat food and tropical fish , hunts pigeons and climbs on the outside of skyscrapers -- and a healthy serving of pratfalls . allen has many comic talents , including fine timing with an exasperated one-liner , but he is not particularly deft at physical comedy . when co-star martin short throws his tiny body at a locked door in a futile attempt to break it down , you see what a real physical comedian looks like ; allen just looks like he realizes he is much smarter than this material . everyone in jungle 2 jungle does thoroughly likeable work in their one-dimensional roles , which is probably as much as you should expect from the performances in a film of this kind . jungle 2 jungle is intended primarily for kids , of course , and it does offer some appealing bits . most of the best ones involve michael's ineptitude with mimi siku's sleep-inducing blow darts , including a very funny struggle to revive charlotte's anesthetized cat . the same kids who find that sequence hilarious probably won't be able to make heads or tails out of the big deal over some coffee , however , nor are they really a proper audience for swishy gay stereotypes or jokes about flatulence and penis size . there just didn't seem to be much thought put into jungle 2 jungle except to give it just enough tailoring to make it a tim allen vehicle . considering that the original outfit they were working with was a cinematic polyester suit like little indian , big city , it might have been a better idea to throw it all away and start from whole cloth . 
screenplay : david cronenberg , based on the novel by j . g . ballard . director : david cronenberg . mpaa rating : nc-17 ( graphic sexual content , violence , profanity ) running time : 100 minutes . in case you were wondering what all the consternation was about concerning crash -- the film which new line chief ted turner nearly refused to release in america in a fit of moral outrage -- writer/director david cronenberg makes it clear in the space of a few minutes . that might be considered quite enough to get some folks worked into a lather , but , dear friends , you ain't seen nothin' yet . this obsession takes on a sexual dimension as well , as confrontations with mortality turn into expressions of primal appetites . i am sure that there are plenty of people who would find plenty of things inherently repugnant about crash , including the fundamental sex-violence link and the fifteen individual scenes involving some kind of sexual behavior between the main characters in every possible form and gender permutation . crash involves some unpleasant subject matter , but i certainly don't think it is evil . there are plenty of dark corners of the human psyche -- many of them dealing with sex -- and crash explores how people might respond to the adrenaline rush of a brush with death in a world where they ordinarily feel deadened , dehumanized and disconnected . it's challenging stuff cronenberg is serving up , but the reason crash ultimately doesn't work has nothing to do with the fact that it's challenging . that person should be james , but it's not . the seductiveness of the crash cult needs to make sense to those of us who don't get off narrating our affairs to our wives , and cronenberg doesn't make that happen . the relatively static nature of james' character also makes it evident that for all its excesses , crash lacks drama , a force pushing it towards some kind of revelation or resolution . spader's performance as james is flat and detached throughout , and we need to have some understanding of his response to vaughan's ever-more-extreme behavior ; every development seems to strike him with the exact same mild confusion . some of cronenberg's scenes are superbly crafted , effective and unsettling -- a tryst while going through a car wash is accompanied by overwhelming sounds of machinery , and one scene after a crash turns smoke from the wreckage into a romanticized mist over a meadow . occasionally crash manages to be erotic , but far more often it is wearying , running sex scenes at you in waves and turning every available moment into an excuse for a grabbed crotch or a frantic menage-a-fill-in-the-blank . it was a mistake for ted turner to equate crash with pornography , because the average porno film probably has more plot . as fitfully intriguing as the psychology of crash may be , it's never engrossing . by failing to give his audience a sense of complicity , he has made them merely spectators at a rather monotonous freak show . 
director : mark dindal . mpaa rating : g running time : 73 minutes , plus 7 minute foghorn leghorn short . industry leader disney had all but given up on animation , and no one else believed that g-rated cartoons could be anything but box-office poison . that was before the booming family video sell-through market made the risk seem less risky , and before a succession of disney features -- the little mermaid , beauty and the beast , aladdin , the lion king -- put the luster back on animation to the tune of over $2 billion in profits including merchandise and ancillary sales . cute critters and peppy tunes , like those in warner's cats don't dance , aren't enough to support a flimsy script and simplistic animation . that plot is the perfect set-up for an animated film , giving animals plenty of chances to break into song , and indeed cats don't dance is a fairly lively endeavor . unfortunately , there is little focus to all that energy . the film barrels along for a tidy 73 minutes , cranking out randy newman musical numbers which seem to peter out after about a dozen bars ; even the show-stopping production number " big and loud " is over practically before you realize it's supposed to be the show-stopping production number . the over-riding philosophy of cats don't dance seems to be that if you blast through everything at a breakneck pace , perhaps no one will have time to notice the lack of attention to detail . no such luck . cats don't dance doesn't just feel rushed -- it looks rushed , like the result of a deadline coming up a bit too fast . the background animation is frequently sketchy and drab , a pale imitation of the vibrant land and cityscapes characteristic of disney's features , while the character animation relies on hirschfeld-style celebrity caricatures and animals who seem to be recycled from warner's afternoon " animaniacs " series . even the most interesting character , the psychotically egotistical darla dimple , is a gloss on " tiny toon adventures " ' wee she-demon elmyra . most of the other characters are overly familiar -- kathy najimy's jovial hippo is a re-tread of her jovial nun from the sister act films , and adorable little penguin pudge ( matthew herried ) is the little mermaid's flounder with wings -- or a waste of the voice talent . that probably won't mean very much to kids , who will likely be amused by the high-spirited goings-on , but that's just not enough after the way disney has raised the bar in the last several years . the house of the mouse has been smart enough to hitch its wagon to timeless stories , resonant themes and memorable characters . cats don't dance is lightweight stuff , a simple " naive kid makes good " story as much _from_ the 1940s as _about_ the 1940s , and that's not necessarily a bad thing . in order to be more than a diversion , however , a film like cats don't dance needs something more : a song you'll be humming for the rest of the day , a visual style which keeps you enthralled , a character you wouldn't mind seeing turn up in a direct-to-video sequel . there's not much of a creative spark to cats don't dance , especially after it opens with a foghorn leghorn short which won't make anyone forget chuck jones' warner bros . glory days . it's something to fill a family-friendly spot on the spring break release schedule , good business but not a very good film . 
screenplay : jonathan hensleigh , wesley strick . director : phillip noyce . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , violence , drug use , adult themes ) running time : 117 minutes . i figure it happened something like this : in the wake of mission : impossible's impressive box office performance , the development executives at paramount were tossing around plot ideas for the sequel . " so what other properties do we own ? " " um , i think we have 'the saint' , " answers executive #2 . it is a nice set-up for a story about an enigmatic loner . unfortunately , it has nothing to do with the character as played by val kilmer . there isn't much haunted , complex history in his characterization ; kilmer spends most of the film looking tremendously self-satisfied , posing behind each disguise and purring every accent . sure it's fun watching kilmer play a variety of eccentric characters , and you can bet that he knows it . when the film takes a sudden shift in tone near the conclusion , turning into a light-hearted caper for the final ten minutes , it actually seems as though director phillip noyce ( clear and present danger ) threw up his hands and decided to let the saint become the film kilmer had been acting in for the previous 100 minutes . actually , it's never clear what the saint is supposed to be . for an action film , it certainly treats the ostensibly primary plot and its associated action as an afterthought . it is interesting to see new faces like serbedzija and valery nikolaev ( as tretiak's son ) in the villain roles , but the roles themselves aren't interesting at all . there are a couple of sharp sequences when the saint actually does provide some action -- emma's dash for the american embassy and simon's unnerving underwater stay in an icy river are particularly notable -- but too many other moments fall flat . some of the action appears to have been salvaged from mission : impossible's cutting room floor , with editing that butchers punch lines , introduces and discards supporting characters , and leaves plenty of threads dangling and questions unanswered . if anyone can explain to me the importance of the microchip the saint steals from tretiak , or why tretiak never makes an effort to retrieve it , i'd sure like to know . i suppose it might seem hypocritical of me to knock the saint for spending so much time developing the romance between simon and emma after i have criticized plenty of other action films for spending no time at all on such matters . shue struggles to make some sense out of a character who has to deliver a lot of exposition and whose weak heart is magically strengthened by love , but it's hard to play a romantic scene with someone who seems to love himself even more than you love him . the saint was unlikely to be a great film even without kilmer's preening , but it would have been a less grating one . perhaps the _real_ sequel to mission : impossible should involve someone trying to tame kilmer's ego . 
screenplay : helen bandis , yael bergman , emma-kate croghan . director : emma-kate croghan . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , sexual situations ) running time : 76 minutes . for what it's worth , i suppose i learned something from love and other catastrophes : romantic comedies can be just as predictable and uninspired in australia as in the u . s . if attractive , likeable actors and a non-threatening lightness of tone count for anything -- and heaven knows that they can -- love and other catastrophes may find an audience receptive to its nominal charms . i suspect audiences are more likely to discover that it has absolutely nothing new to say , and that its moderately eccentric/neurotic characters are very familiar . love and other catastrophes is a ride on flat , straight ground to nowhere in particular . there is a certain energy to love and other catastrophes which makes it hard to dislike actively . the cast is uniformly appealing , and unlike may romantic larks about young people , the characters never start to grate on your nerves with their insecurities and crises . so much for the damning with faint praise . as nice as the characters are , most of them never progress beyond a single dimension . alice is the most complex character , a perfectionist whose impossibly high standards for a significant other take a back seat to some animal lust for ari , but croghan and her co-writers never explore that dynamic ; it's just a blip on alice's emotional radar which quickly vanishes . the characters march with such ease toward their respective happy endings that there is not a moment of tension , and it's all so shallow that you may forget every relationship half an hour after watching . even the very 90s twist of making one of the couples lesbian can't generate much spark . a couple without chemistry is a couple without chemistry , gay or straight . among the more perplexing aspects of love and other catastrophes are croghan's few attempts at idiosyncrasy , all of which fall flat . a farcical scene of film students dressed like their idols ( quentin tarantino , woody allen , etc . ) seems wildly out of place , and the burnt orange cinematography makes you wonder whether don simpson and jerry bruckheimer hijacked the production somewhere along the line . i suppose croghan had to do something to spice up the material , but it might have been a better idea to write a complete script , develop the characters and their relationships , _then_ put together a good-looking cast of characters . frances o'connor's bright smile and matt day's geeky handsomeness can buy few minutes of good will , but sooner or later people have to do something vaguely interesting . love and other catastrophes isn't a catastrophe ; it's just the kind of aimlessly frothy romantic comedies america has churned out a hundred times before . only the accents have been changed to distinguish the guilty . 
director : dwight little . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , sexual situations ) running time : 105 minutes . at 1600 is yet another in the long line of recent films ( shadow conspiracy , my fellow americans , absolute power ) which have turned the white house into cinema's reigning repository of all things dark , sinister and/or lascivious . it's not that some of that building's residents haven't done a good job of that on their own , at least according to the juicier innuendo , but come on already . one oliver stone film a year is enough without every suspense hack to come down the pike throwing an army of sinister secret service agents and megalomaniacal policy wonks at some poor sucker every six to eight weeks . it would be telling to reveal the plot behind the murder , but naturally it's more complicated than we or regis initially believe , and involves a more far-reaching conspiracy . i've said before that i'm not a big believer in conspiracy theories , but that's not why i think most films about conspiracy theories are so mediocre at best . screenwriters wayne beach and david hodgin aren't interested in creating characters -- regis and chance each have one hobby , as though that defined a personality -- and it's fairly obvious why . the conspiracy _is_ the central character in films like this , with the actors merely running around to achieve dastardly ends or to thwart them . a film isn't " important " just because it shows people in power abusing that power , but the film-makers behave as though the seriousness of their subject matter should be enough to satisfy the audience . worse still , they behave as though no one else had ever thought of the idea . snipes is a likeable enough performer , but he is not doing himself any favors by adding this film to a string of lumbering action duds like drop zone and money train . when a role makes you smart enough to save the government but stupid enough to walk up to a suicidal , gun-wielding lunatic and start chatting about your bureaucratic pet peeves , it's time to use the script for something useful like smacking your agent in the head . daniel benzali and alan alda have more to do with the heavy roles , but they're just as stranded ; dennis miller's snarky sarcasm as snipes' partner is more a comment on the quality of the film than anything going on in the film ; tv pundit john mclaughlin looks delighted at the prospect of earning his sag card for his 100th cameo appearance . murder at 1600 is full of paycheck parts , and the cast doesn't dignify them with anything more than paycheck performances . murder at 1600 might have been at least a moderately diverting thriller if director dwight little ( rapid fire , marked for death ) had included a few . . . well , thrills . it's a startlingly suspenseless suspense thriller little has cobbled together , with drawn-out chase scenes and shoot-outs which create a lot more noise than tension . by the time our heroes begin their invasion of the white house through the underground tunnel system -- which gets so much pedestrian traffic in these films that there ought to be a hot dog cart and a souvenir shop -- the audience probably won't care very much who is responsible for the film's central crime . if you've never seen one of these films before , you might get a buzz out of seeing the mighty brought low . some of us have been on this particular white house tour too many times to find anything interesting about one more secret meeting in the oval office or one more clandestine rendezvous in the lincoln bedroom . 
the story of their adventures might have included beautiful wildlife photography , tense moments of realistic clashes with nature and the wonder of the natural world which made marty stouffer's " wild america " series a success . that's not the kind of film you can expect hollywood to make about this kind of story , however . the bulk of the film is in fact set in the wilds of america , but it's not likely to inspire much reverence for nature . for every moment of grandeur like a stampede of wild horses , there are encounters played almost entirely for laughs : a tussle with an alligator , a ride on a moose's horns , a cave full of bears dozing off to a lullaby which concludes with a chorus of flatulence . these scenes will likely entertain young audience members , but they hardly inspire much respect for majestic beasts . the low-brow comedy in wild america is frustrating enough , but dear and screenwriter david michael wieger aren't even willing to commit to being low-brow . the wilderness-based second act of wild america ain't art , but at least it tries to entertain . the twenty minutes between the boys' return to fort smith and the closing credits crawl by with an agonizing sincerity . then again , wild america isn't really about parents letting go , either , any more than it's about learning to respect nature . judging by an audience comprised largely of teen and pre-teen girls , wild america is really about its cute trio of teen stars . in retrospect , this conglomeration of themes does have one guiding principle . it's a cross between " national geographic " and " tiger beat .

in hollywood , the place where paradigms reign and conceptual blockbusting goes to die , among the most hallowed of paradigms is the 90 minute running time . you may be able to get away with 85 , and five or ten fewer for an animated feature , but anything less would appear to risk rending the very fabric of space-time . never mind that a popular 45-minute film , with its potential for nine or ten cut-rate showings a day plus concession sales from twice as many intermissions , would be an exhibitor's fantasy . the 90-minute mandate exists for one fairly obvious , and fairly depressing , reason : it's less complicated for studios to keep throwing money at bloated , mediocre films than it is for them to figure out how to make and market shorter , better ones . nothing to lose could have been a hilarious 30 or 40 minutes of comic film-making . instead , it's an over-stuffed 97 minutes , not because it should have been but because it _had_ to be . along the way , writer-director steve oedekerk places nick and t . paul into some bizarre and truly inventive situations . at odd moments , nothing to lose will catch you off guard with a memorable supporting performance or an unpredictable punch line . since oedekerk is a veteran of stand-up comedy and sketch writing for " in living color , " it should be surprising that hit-and-run gags play to his strengths . nor should it be surprising that the length of a feature film does not . he fills the spaces between clever comic moments with sub-plots which probably were meant to provide " depth , " but instead merely provide " length . " this lame attempt at social commentary robs both characters of the edge which would have made a shorter , sharper nothing to lose crackle with creativity . tim robbins as just another uptight liberal-in-training is a bore . martin lawrence as a sympathetic family man is a strain on credulity like a tractor-trailer is a strain on a vespa . ninety-seven minutes gives him too much time to search for a happy ending , one which would have been much happier for all involved if it had come an hour earlier . calling a critic 'elitist' is like calling an accountant 'mathist .

mpaa rating : pg ( mild profanity , scatalogical humor ) running time : 92 minutes . george of the jungle suffers from a fundamental , insurmountable split personality : it wants both to be a big , dumb comedy for 8-year-olds and to make fun of the fact that it is a big , dumb comedy for 8-year-olds . the former is fairly easy , particularly for disney , whose recent contributions like jungle2jungle and d ( whatever integer the mighty ducks series is up to lately ) make you wonder why they don't just spin off a live-action banner called big dumb comedies for 8-year-olds pictures . the latter , however , requires subtlety . . . finesse . . a keen sense of how far is just far enough . now that you have lifted yourself off the floor from convulsions of laughter , i'll confirm your suspicions that george of the jungle does not represent the platonic form of subtlety , finesse , or a keen sense of how far is just far enough . there are pratfalls and comic brawls a-plenty . and there are at least 475 separate gags involving either a ) flatulence , b ) excrement , c ) urine or d ) injuries or the threat of injury to the male gonads . all of which works just fine on its own level , except that screenwriters dana olsen and audrey wells then feel obliged to get meta-conscious on us . most films of this stripe would be perfectly comfortable simply serving up a scene where a nasty character like ursula's erstwhile fiance lyle van de groot ( thomas haden church ) falls face first into a steaming elephant pile . classic element of physical comedy ! " it's tough to take a film seriously as a wry commentary on its own excesses , especially when those excesses are the main reason the majority of the audience is watching . george of the jungle's attempts at something resembling sophistication and wit , half-hearted though they may be , are clearly an attempt to capture the spirit of the animated namesake created by jay ward ( of " rocky and bullwinkle " fame ) . they also demonstrate a radical misunderstanding of what was amusing about ward's efforts . like " rocky and bullwinkle , " " george of the jungle " was smart satire rich with exaggerated word-play . it also featured a lunk-headed hero played completely straight , a far jungle cry from the sensitive noble savage served up by brendan fraser . there's nothing to connect this george of the jungle to jay ward's " george of the jungle " except the theme song , which is probably the one thing most people will remember about the animated series . those who remember more may be hoping for more than this predictable kiddie matinee posing as savvy family entertainment . calling a critic 'elitist' is like calling an accountant 'mathist .

once upon a time , many years ago when the earth was still young , i read comic books . in fact , i read them quite avidly . i attended comic book conventions , kept my collection in acid-free boxes and bought the overstreet price guide every year . i remember the fervor with which comic book fans defend their favorite characters , and the excitement generated by the first film appearance of a character . my first encounter with this phenomenon from the other side of the philosophical fence came when i dared to give only fleeting praise to 1994's the crow . from the reactions of the film's fans , you would think not only that i had challenged the film's artistic merit , but also that i had performed an excretory act on brandon lee's grave . the idea for the story , i felt , was intriguing , the execution merely competent . and the wrath it raineth down . now i steel myself once again , because folks , spawn ain't even _that_ good . anyone familiar with the crow is going to experience a bit of conceptual deja vu with spawn . at its best , spawn does provide some genuinely eye-catching visual effects for its titular character . spawn's body armor is perfectly rendered , sprouting all manner of computer-generated weaponry and a billowing red cape as necessity demands . leguizamo also provides entertainment value by tossing off crude gags between bouts of flatulence . at its worst , spawn provides the kind of horrid acting often excused in genre films with the description " campy , " with half the cast ( white , sheen , leguizamo ) doing gutteral line readings ( because the forces of evil always talk like mercedes mccambridge in " the exorcist " ) and the other half ( randle , williamson , d . b . sweeney ) standing around looking befuddled . it also offers a decidedly sony play station vision of hell , and a script which doesn't bother to give the main character a life before it gives him an afterlife . most of the time , however , spawn is neither at its best nor at its worst . it is merely redundant , a now-familiar plot of gloom-soaked heroism decked out with the expected trappings of perpetually rainy alleys , gothic spires and a couple of explosions . i'm not familiar enough with the time line of recent comics to know whether " the crow " pre-dated " spawn " in comic book form , but it doesn't really matter . viewers of spawn may find a few new and improved special effects , but everything else is re-used and recycled ; even leguizamo's performance as clown seems like a slightly more scatalogical spin on nicholson's joker . comic books may have picked up a certain improbable cachet when they started referring to themselves as " graphic novels , " but that attitude has merely resulted in a different kind of creative rut . it's like graphic grunge rock , where an energetic and invigorating first wave has given way to endless imitators who can't seem to lighten up and stop whining . even when screenwriter alan mcelroy tries to temper the angst with glib quips , the result is something strictly for fans of the new and improved special effects . or , perhaps , for die-hard spawn fans who may be preparing an effigy of yours truly even as we speak . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : miguel arteta . director : miguel arteta . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , nudity , adult themes , sexual situations , violence ) running time : 85 minutes . good intentions can make up for a lot , but they can't make up for star maps . the fact that this family is mexican-american should be incidental , but it's likely that the ethnic angle ( along with the " controversial " material ) is all that snared star maps a distribution deal . he simply says them all at the same time , creating a cacophany of heavy issues colliding with one another . every once in a while , moments of humanity creep unexpectedly into arteta's story . too often , the impact of those moments is blunted by lack of direction . and " lack of direction " applies in both senses of the term . even more than by its rambling script , star maps is thwarted by arteta's inability to put together a remotely professional production . his performers , it can be said charitably , read their lines in comprehensible english sentences ; his copious use of slow-motion , flashbacks and low-tech visual tricks can't camouflage a basic technical clumsiness . somewhere in star maps are a few interesting ideas , but arteta forces viewers to wade through a swamp of muddled exposition and amateurish film-making , then doesn't offer them a map to get out again . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : max d . adams and dick clement & ian la frenais . director : marco brambilla . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 100 minutes . it casts her in a role which seems perfectly suited to continuing that drawing power -- she's a motherless rich girl looking for a little affection , a la clueless -- and gives her plenty of opportunities to flash that crooked baby doll smile . make no mistake , excess baggage is the alicia silverstone show . so why does it feel like she is the one thing most dreadfully wrong with excess baggage ? perhaps because excess baggage , which appears on the surface to be an ideal comic caper vehicle for silverstone's daffy charms , is really an oddball black comedy struggling to break free . that is exactly what director marco brambilla tries to deliver , with miserable results . the first half of excess baggage moves with all the frisky energy of a constipated brontosaurus , offerring little more than monotonous bickering between the two leads . there's never a moment of chemistry between silverstone and del toro , no magnetism -- in fact , all known natural processes come to a dead stop when they are on screen together . they might as well be performing in two different films . at least one of those films might have been worth watching . benicio del toro is , to put it mildly , an unconventional screen presence , but he's never a boring one . his every reaction in excess baggage is worth a giggle of disbelief ; the more ridiculous and over-heated the plot gets , the more interesting del toro becomes . even while the story in excess baggage wanders from the mundane to the predictable , actors like del toro , christopher walken and nicholas turturro provide line readings with a bracing dose of surreality . " surreal " might as well be something you have at breakfast with milk as far as silverstone's performance is concerned . when it comes to playing material with an edge , she seems . . . well , it's much too late for her to recover her adorableness by the time the romance turns more conventional , complete with dialogue ( " do you like my tummy ? " ) which should come with a warning label if you're going to listen to it with a mouthful of popcorn . i can't imagine what silverstone's young fans will make of this strange film in which their idol is annoying and unlikeable , then hooks up with such a weirdo . if silverstone the newly-crowned mogul wanted to make a romantic comedy , she shouldn't have cast benicio del toro . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
promotional posters for she's so lovely describe it as " a film by nick cassavetes from a fable by john cassavetes , " a tag-line which prompted a visit to my american heritage dictionary : 1 ) a concise narrative making an edifying or cautionary point , often employing as characters animals which speak and act like human beings . " i suppose you could say that she's so lovely fits that definition , in the sense that it makes a cautionary point . as for animals acting like people , you won't find any in she's so lovely . people acting like animals . . . well , that's another story . there is at least a convincingly seamy aura to the portion of she's so lovely devoted to eddie and maureen's kinetic romance . vintage cassavetes ambiance drips from the depressingly silent flop houses and dive bars , and from the characters wandering around in a directionless , drunken daze . yet even in its best moments , she's so lovely feels not quite right . it's like the steak transported through the telepods in david cronenberg's version of the fly , a story from another era which has been rendered synthetic in its transport to 1997 . despite the strong performances and affectingly crazy exploits of penn and penn , there's the feel of an homage to the first half of she's so lovely . it has no unique identity . to show you how far looking for a unique identity gets you , witness the second half of she's so lovely . but young cassavetes treats the whole episode as the wacky premise for a profane situation comedy , as though papa had banged out a very special episode of " my two dads " twenty years ago . the whimsical score by joseph vitarelli consistently undermines the seriousness of the matters at hand ; situations like eddie's appointment with an effeminate hairdresser are treated as atmospheric goofiness . instead of wondering whom maureen will end up with , your mind wanders to why nick didn't go all the way and use a laugh track . for that matter , it's not clear what john was thinking when he wrote it , with its half-realized characters , awkwardly constructed narrative and weightless romantic triangle . there's a lesson to be learned here , something like " it's best to let sleeping scripts lie .

director : jocelyn moorhouse . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , brief nudity ) running time : 104 minutes . no one involved is pretending a thousand acres _isn't_ a gloss on " lear . " the front cover flap of jane smiley's pulitzer prize-winning 1991 novel flatly proclaims it , and the film's production notes explain the connection in detail . but that didn't have to be all there was to the film . there was certainly plenty more to smiley's novel , an engrossing tale filled with lyrical prose and finely-observed details about the daily routines of farm life . that sense of a specific place , as well as the specific time of malaise-era 1979 , gave the novel a distinctive feel which transcended the familiarity of the basic plot elements . director jocelyn moorhouse's rendering of the story , on the other hand , never quite stakes out its own territory . sure , it retains smiley's unique sympathy for the daughers -- her angle suggests lear deserved everything he got , and then some -- as well as the strong sibling relationship . both jessica lange and michelle pfeiffer turn in strong performances , particularly lange as the placid , unquestioning ginny . yet even their relationship can't hold a thousand acres together once laura jones' script starts racing from melodramatic plot point to melodramatic plot point , as though capturing every sordid detail would result in capturing the essence of the material . without the poetry and perspective of smiley's language , the story becomes little more than a collection of tragedies -- shakespeare without the wisdom or the words . it's like something out of a pitch meeting from the player : " it's king lear , but it's funny , and sad , and with breast cancer , adultery , domestic violence , alcoholism and child abuse . " actually , not exactly sad , and not at all funny . even when the film turns to pathos , it never allows the audience an emotional catharsis because no one seems eager to reach a resolution . meanwhile the only laughs are of the gallows variety , mostly connected to realizations that characters have suffered yet another humiliation , with a dash of mixed shakespearean metaphor ( a reference to the merchant of venice's " pound of flesh " ) thrown in for good measure . talented cinematographer tak fujimoto does his best to capture smiley's iowa landscapes visually , but his is an effort doomed to failure . it's a character shakespeare didn't come up with , and it's one of the things which gave a thousand acres its own personality and resonance on the page . how sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have such a disappointing adaption . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
director : gary fleder . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 115 minutes . i'm thinking of putting together a self-help book which would assist talented performers trying to come to terms with making a terrible film . i'd call it something like " smart actors , foolish choices , " or maybe " why bad movies happen to good people . " within its pages would be testemonials and guidance , reminding the readers that they're not alone in making the isolated career blunder . bad example . for an actor wallowing in " what was i thinking ? " , of course , my motives wouldn't be entirely altruistic . my research might also help me understand how films like kiss the girls come to pass . somewhere in this trite , uninspired psycho-thriller , two gifted actors found something worth exploring . i wish i could figure out what that thing was . it's not just that kiss the girls trots out the over-used serial predator as its villain , or that it relies on a " surprising " revelation of the villain's identity ; both devices can be used effectively , and have been in recent years . kiss the girls doesn't work because there's no reason to care about who casanova is , what he does , or what he's going to do . director gary fleder never generates any tension or simmering menace , assuming that murky cinematography will do his work for him . perhaps he spends so little time on the tone because he has a hard enough time keeping the viewers focused on the basic facts of the plot . some of his narrative leaps are utterly baffling , sending audience members into a frenzy of muttered " who's he's " and " where are they now's . " to be fair to fleder , his directionless direction matches the directionless script with which he's working . the characters in kiss the girls are so thinly defined that it never seems to be about anything but plodding along until it's time to unmask casanova , yet even that major plot point is ineptly handled . screenwriter david klass doesn't bother to drop the faintest clue about who casanova might be , to the extent that he could have been picking a name out of a hat when casanova finally shows his face . worse still , klass doesn't bother to explore the villain's motives . shouldn't we care _why_ ? the only bright spots in kiss the girls , not surprisingly , are the performances by freeman and judd . even then , the script doesn't pull us into kate's emotions . it's hard to believe there was anything on the page which made these characters -- or this by-the-numbers story -- seem appealing , but freeman and judd took them on anyway . maybe these parts were the best they could find . maybe they suffered severe brain cramps at critical moments . i feel their pain . . . i had to _watch_ kiss the girls . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
there is no doubt in my mind that david duchovny can be a movie star . his often under-appreciated work on " the x-files " has demonstrated both dramatic chops and a wry sense of humor , as well as the requisite physicality for action . duchovny has the looks , the smarts and the range on the big screen to go places most fellow tv alums never go . it's also clear that he knows how to pick interesting scripts . to a resume which already includes unconventional fare like kalifornia and the rapture , duchovny adds mark haskell smith's playing god . smith's script does about all you could ask a script to do , delivering some well-developed characters and smart dialogue ( okay , there are a couple of howlers ) in service of that premise . duchovny selected a nice piece of material to work with , but playing god shows that an actor can't choose most of the things which go into the making of a good film . it has the feel of a film which should have been much better , but turned out inconsistent and sloppy under the first-time direction of andy wilson ( of the popular cable mystery series " cracker " ) . there are times when wilson tries so hard to create his gritty thriller atmosphere -- all distorted imagery , slow motion and awkward cross-cutting -- that the narrative begins to get lost . he's going for the right mood , but with the wrong methods . duchovny also had no control over the performances of his cast-mates , though from all appearances , neither did the director . his performance might have been even more effective if a dozen other supporting players weren't making unhinged seem so unnecessary . the general tone of the performances makes duchovny stand out like buster keaton in a three stooges short . his deadpan demeanor begins to seem like a reaction to a bunch of nutcase actors let loose on the screen , rather than the appropriate personality for his redemption-hungry character . in fact , duchovny is too " together " most of the time ; rock bottom doesn't look all that bad if that's where he's supposed to be when we meet him . then again , it's hard to say whether that particular character choice was duchovny's to make . you can see his star quality in playing god , but you can also see that picking a sharp script is no guarantee that an actor will be in a sharply-made film . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
by the time dennis quaid , the ostensible star of switchback , makes his first appearance at about the 22-minute mark , you may find yourself wondering why he bothered . all the necessary conflicts seem to be in place -- the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work , and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the other's protagonist . it wouldn't be fair to reduce everything that's wrong with switchback to quaid's presence , but it's a pretty good place to start . there's a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center : as a dramatic actor , dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation . we can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is a perpetual tight-jawed , sourpuss pucker ; we can tell he's grim because every word comes out in an eastwood-esque rasp . a more flexible performer might have given weight to the character , pulling the audience into his haunted intensity , making switchback _his_ film . quaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated . it's tough to become emotionally invested in a character's turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes . even without quaid , it doesn't appear that switchback would have stayed on course . the early scenes between leto and glover have a lively energy , building our curiosity over which man -- the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor -- is the real threat . unfortunately , stuart tips his hand far too early in the game , both through the pitch of the individual performances and the facts he chooses to reveal . once the mystery of the killer's identity is dispatched , the interaction between leto and glover becomes stale and predictable . it's too bad stuart wasn't willing to spend more time with sheriff olmstead , far and away the most interesting and appealing character in the film . a film focusing on the olmstead would have signaled a film-maker willing to take a few risks with his casting and story-telling . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : melissa mathison . director : martin scorsese . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , adult themes ) running time : 135 minutes . martin scorsese's kundun , advertised as " the amazing story of the fourteenth dalai lama , " is a beautifully filmed and extraordinarily reverent bio-pic . and it's a strong dose of cinematic nyquil . though it's bound to please those who admire its subject , other viewers are going to wonder why they should spend over two hours watching a film with only the faintest whisper of internal conflict . the most frustrating thing about kundun is that it's the kind of story i've chastised hollywood for not telling . unlike the recent seven years in tibet , it is a story set in tibet which is actually about tibetans , featuring a cast composed entirely of non-professional actors . that gives kundun a greater sense of integrity , but it does nothing for the dramatic impact of the story . what we see scarcely a moment of is the dalai lama as an individual . though he sometimes sees terrible visions , this preternaturally serene teen almost never seems shaken or lacking in confidence . the resulting film is completely faithful , but it moves like a tortoise in need of a laxative . when the dalai lama begins looking through his telescope as an adolescent , i started hoping he'd spot brad pitt so the production could find some energy . eventually there is a bit more interest generated by the dalai lama's interactions with the chinese . though this ideological battle should provide plenty of chances for strong dramatic sequences , it rarely does . even a few more such moments could have given the suffering of the tibetan people a face and an emotional connection . this is a history of a repressed people which almost never leaves the confines of the world of politicians . martin scorsese is too talented a director to put together anything that is a complete waste of time . it's what happens in front of that backdrop which may cause you do drop back in your seat and grab a quick nap . as important a story as kundun may be , the film rarely does more than trudge through fifteen years of tibetan history , always careful to show the utmost respect for his holiness . perhaps scorsese saw this as an opportunity to make up for his previous attempt at the life story of a revered figure , one which sparked instant outrage . no chance of controversy this time around -- think of kundun as the lack of temptation of the dalai lama . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
the film , on the other hand , isn't quite so resolute . the images are powerful and immediate , but they become the story rather than complementing it . henderson begins to seem like a character digitally insterted , forrest gump-like , into historical events . when the story does focus on his actions , it fumbles away too many opportunities to personalize its grand-scale tragedy . character relationships , like those between henderson and a brash american reporter ( woody harrelson ) and his no-nonsense producer ( kerry fox ) , get just enough attention to be frustrating ; henderson's devotion to an orphan named emira ( emira nusevic ) is rushed until it feels more like a cinematic necessity than a genuine connection . even the film's most potentially intense sequence , involving the illegal transport of a bus-load of orphans out of the country , feels strangely sedate despite one gripping encounter at a bosnian checkpoint . that sequence doesn't even serve as the film's climax , leading into a dry 20-minute search for emira's birth mother which grinds welcome to sarajevo to a halt . far too often , winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce demonstrate a clumsy disregard for building a narrative with an emotional pull beyond its bursts of authentic violence . i can easily imagine a film like welcome to sarajevo degenerating into pathos in hollywood hands , so perhaps it deserves some credit for avoiding copious shots of sad-eyed waifs . winterbottom simply goes too far in the other direction . the performances and direction are sturdy but rarely inspired , resulting in a film which makes us feel terrible about this tragic conflict in a very abstract sense . welcome to sarajevo is good reporting , but it's not particularly good drama , treating its subject with the concerned detachment of a newsmagazine feature story . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
fallen proves that if you want to evoke millennial dread , you can't just flirt with it -- you've got to embrace it . all are talented performers who acquit themselves admirably , but not not a one of them has much to work with in nicholas kazan's script . the dialogue is certainly effective , particularly in its laconic familiarity of co-worker and familial interaction . the story simply doesn't create a single compelling character to anchor the narrative . that includes hobbes , who remains a vaguely heroic cipher despite the work of consummate professional washington . in fact , the only real spark of personality comes from the film's body-hopping villain , who occupies so many different characters that he provides more of a menacing general presence than a specific personality . while gregory hoblit puts together a few unique and creepy moments , including a chase through a busy city street which becomes a psychic relay race , his approach to the material is disappointingly conventional . his tone is that of a slightly-gloomier-than-average crime drama , with filtered point-of-view shots used and over-used ass the only distinctive signal of a demonic presence . in short , it's just not all that disturbing , or even particularly creative in its approach to the subject of demons walking among us . isolated moments build effective tension , but hoblit and kazan ultimately resort to the kind of obligatory " gotcha " climax which can leave an audience with the faint aftertaste of cleverness despite a general lack of substance . like hoblit's primal fear , fallen is a well-made and well-acted film which too often settles for the easy or obvious way to handle a situation . when that situation involves the vengeful soul of an ageless fallen angel , you should hope for a bit more than gunplay and the crooning of rolling stones tunes . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : dan aykroyd and john landis . director : john landis . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) . running time : 123 minutes . much of the film's unlikely success was attributed to the chemistry between belushi and aykroyd , but the primary responsibility of the two stars was to maintain a stoic demeanor behind their dark glasses . no , i think the blues brothers worked because it really _was_ like a mission for those involved . if that meant juxtaposing the godfather of soul and vehicular chaos , so be it . if blues brothers 2000 leaves a viewer feeling less than satisfied , it's not necessarily due to the absence of the late belushi , though john goodman does frequently seem unsure exactly what to do with himself . the main problem is the absence of a similar focus on the music , replaced by a more cynical attempt to re-create the past . i'm not suggesting that the blues brothers was anybody's idea of a streamlined narrative . every one of those things , _plus_ items a-c above . the pointed effort to recreate every situation from the original -- recruiting the band members from new vocations , playing a gig for a crowd expecting a different musical style , etc . -- draws attention to the structure in a way which makes it feel muddled rather than original , tired , rather than inspired . even aykroyd's performance draws unnecessary attention to itself , fooling with the notion that elwood is a three-dimensional character in need of growth . they may also be quite disappointed at how the loss of his deadpan reactions takes the edge off the absurdist comedy . for all its flaws , however , there's almost enough energy in the musical numbers alone to make blues brothers 2000 worth watching . between the high-spirited production numbers and one spectacular hundred-police-car pile-up -- a hilarious non-stop parade of soaring , crashing metal -- there is enough fun to satisfy most viewers , particularly if the familiarity is exactly what they're looking for . it's too bad that the much of the film feels rushed , flattened and processed , like a knock-off sequel cranked out in 18 months instead of 18 years , to be sold with a marketing-friendly abbreviation like bb2k . even with all the retail destruction and collapsing buildings in the blues brothers , it used to be about the _music_ , man . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
producers : matthais wendlandt and al corley . director : volker schlondorff . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , adult themes , violence ) running time : 112 minutes . a femme fatale . a deception . these are the little things of which the contemporary film noir mystery is made , so predictably that the genre has descended into the kind of ridiculous self-parody of which direct-to-video mickey rourke vehicles are made . with too many film-makers content to keep re-making double indemnity and body heat , there doesn't seem to be anywhere to go but subversion . for a while , that looks like where palmetto is headed . standard noir stuff , to be sure , tag-teaming with a sultry south florida setting to create some major deja vu . harry appears to be hopelessly inept , portrayed by harrelson with his impressive gift for convincing ineptitude . sadly , palmetto soon veers from goofiness to predictable over-complexity to twisty-turny absurdity . the plot twists become ever more elaborate and ever more unnecessary , burying a few sturdy sequences like harry's efforts to keep a cop from spotting a body in his car's trunk . i half expected the story to be concluded next week , same bat-time , same bat-channel . i suppose at the very least palmetto succeeds at avoiding the film noir rut where only the names change from one film to the next . it's just bizarre enough that it might have been entertaining , if only it made an ounce of sense . credit harrelson and frye with providing a brief , faint hope that noir might have a few more miles left in it , provided somebody remembers to bring along a steering wheel . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " .

" but let's cut to the chase here . . . u . s . marshals is a spin-off . before the word " spin-off " and its accompanying visions of " the ropers " and " joanie loves chachi " sends you into screaming early-80s flashbacks , it should be clear that there are far worse supporting characters around whom to build a story , and far worse actors . jones slips back into gerard's no-excuses professionalism without missing a beat , barking orders or wearing a big chicken costume with equal levels of commitment if that's what it takes to get the job done . it's not that gerard doesn't work at all as a lead character ; it's just that he worked so much better as a supporting character . well , sheridan is no everyman -- he's " former special forces , former black ops " ( and these days , what action film character worth his salt isn't ? ) . that should make him a more challenging assignment for gerard , except sheridan never seems to be thinking hard enough or working hard enough to clear his name . with energy diverted to making gerard a more " well-rounded " character , wesley snipes is left to wander around the film like a half-forgotten plot device . director stuart baird , who created a solid but unspectacular action effort in executive decision , has done a similar job crafting the action in u . s . marshals . with the exception of the big spectacular plane crash to match the fugitive's big spectacular train crash , he rarely goes out of his way to top his predecessor ; the action simply moves along competently despite a few sluggish editing choices . overall , however , u . s . marshals just isn't a very smart film . grainy flashbacks assume no one in the audience can remember back half an hour , characters are careless when it's convenient for them to be and a convoluted tangle of international espionage keeps distracting the audience from the mano-a-mano which should drive the story . actually , the fugitive had a few similar problems , but it got you so involved in the characters that those problems were easy to overlook . u . s . marshals is a generic vehicle patterned after a successful parent , one which doesn't use the characters the way they could be used best . that , my friends , is a spin-off . and one less like " frasier " than it is like " afterm * a * s * h .

at the 1998 sundance film festival , writer/director boaz yakin commented that a price above rubies isn't so much specifically about life in the hasidic jewish community as it is about " being an individual in any society where conformity and tradition dominate . " the story could just as easily have taken place in the amish country , apparently , or in any other highly conservative culture . in a cinematic era of hot air and gimmickry , it's hard to fault a film-maker when he's trying to tell a story _about_ something . unfortunately for yakin , beginning with a theme doesn't work when the cultural atmosphere is as crucial to a story as hasidic judaism is to a price above rubies . you can feel the world shifting constantly within her , conveyed through the naked emotionalism of zellweger's performance . it's a movie set with costumes and props , into which sonia might just as well have been dropped like an alien into a spielbergian american suburb . yakin commits himself so thoroughly to making sonia a genuinely complex character that he doesn't take the time to fill in the background . it certainly doesn't help that some of the blind-to-a-fault casting stretches credulity to the breaking point . british actor christopher eccleston chews on his new yawk accent as though he were about to blow a bubble with it , while creating a borderline melodramatic rendition of manipulative villainy . if you want to distill what doesn't work in a price above rubies into two words , try to imagine renee zellweger convincingly uttering the magic words , " oy gevalt . " a price above rubies is the sort of sincere , well-meaning movie which makes you feel vaguely guilty for not liking it more , since it is never sincere and well-meaning in that ponderous , self-righteous way which characterizes so many hollywood " issue " dramas . there are some wonderful touches to enjoy , notably an insinuating score by lesley barber , which complement yakin's patient narrative development . sonia's story of self-actualization is bound to resonate with some viewers , because it is both heartfelt and honest . but while yakin manages to make the film feel honest , he doesn't make it feel _true_ . without the richness of a fully-realized society as a foundation for character study , a price above rubies essentially offers solid actors in an under-stated tolerance lecture . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
there comes a time in a critic's life when he simply has nothing to say about a film as gruellingly generic as mercury rising , but he's got space to fill so he keeps on jabbering away anyway . this is the kind of action film where dogs jump out of nowhere to spook the audience , where glass shatters in slow motion , and where children are placed in jeopardy . it's the kind of action film which went through a slew of title changes -- from simple simon to simon to mercury falling to mercury rising -- but may as well have been called bruce willis action film project 1998 . it's competent , business-like and utterly uninspired . i suppose mercury rising deserves at least an ounce of credit for trying to make its protagonist human . nice try , bad idea . i don't know who thought it was wise to remake rain man as a gritty thriller , but it's a combination that falls completely flat . though willis is a cut above his action hero contemporaries as an actor , he still can't work miracles with a character reduced to baleful stares and hoarse whispers as he vainly struggles to befriend his troubled charge . it's not just that he has trouble connecting with simon , which is sort of the point -- he has trouble connecting with anyone . it's that kind of creative deja-vu which makes sitting through mercury rising such a chore . it's not that it's a terrible film ; in fact , director harold becker's pacing is a cut above recent genre cousins , the narrative never actively insults , and the performances are solid all the way around . mode , even gets off a sharp little inside joke when he tells a mach-posturing willis " you've been watching too many of those 4-wheel-drive commercials " ( baldwin himself being the television voice of chevy trucks ) . but those are the kind of moments you grasp for when you've seen the same film a dozen times a year for the last five years , when you've written about the same film a dozen times a year for the last five years . if your objective in watching a film like mercury rising is spending a two hour block which will immediately blur into previous two hour blocks , you've found a winner . you may even have something worth writing about it . if so , i've got a couple of column inches you could help fill . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
i can't remember a film getting as much mileage out of a single visual gag as my giant gets out of its one and only visual gag . soon the unlikely pair are on the road together , every scene between them something that momentarily fools you into thinking there _must_ be some special effects at work . it's enough to make you wonder why they don't make silent films anymore , when this one could have been thoroughly enjoyable without a single character opening his or her mouth . crystal , for his part has always been good with a reaction take and a vaudevillian's sense for milking a laugh visually . saturday night and now my giant . david seltzer's script piles on the pathos so thick -- tender moments between sammy and his estranged wife ( kathleen quinlan ) , sad-eyed tete-a-tetes with his son ( zane carney ) , lillianna's rejection of max , a potentially life-threatening ailment for one main character -- that it threatens to crush everything in its path . the few decent jokes crystal manages to squeeze in between the heart-felt glances hardly seem worth the effort . muresan , meanwhile , is just too endearingly goofy not to look at , a great dane puppy in a peasant shirt . if you've seen his hilarious snickers commercial , in which he hawks an eponymous cabbage-cented cologne on a home shopping channel , you know muresan has charm and a surprising comic sense . you would also know that , compared to muresan's marble-mouthed diction , andre the giant sounded like he studied with henry higgins . it's an undemanding role , one in which muresan demonstrates infinitely more screen presence than fellow hoopster-cum-thespians like shaquille o'neal and michael jordan . you just can't help wishing that the big guy would continue to smile engagingly while embarking on fewer adventures into the english language . whatever its failings , my giant is almost worth watching simply for a few jaw-droppings cenes featuring steven seagal . playing himself on the set of an action movie where max might play the villain , seagal shows more willingness to poke fun at his image than i ever suspected he had in him . when his director asks if a scene could be better with one more take , a casually arrogant seagal answers , " no ; " when he makes a call to sammy's son as a favor , he allows the skeptical boy to mock his look ( " that stupid ponytail " ) , his acting ( " lessons . . . how about taking a few ? " ) and his muttered line-readings ( " are you going to go hang out with stallone so i can understand you _less_ ? " ) for five minutes , my giant is comic genius , and seagal deflates himself masterfully . my giant has its moments , but its generally such a tepid and non-threatening comedy that the moments can't add up to much . feel-good shmaltz like this works much better when you don't have to listen to the shmaltz being spelled out for you . call me old-fashioned , but i prefer to imagine a version of my giant made 70 years ago , where no precious speeches got in the way of chuckling at mis-matched protagonists . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : james toback . director : james toback . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 85 minutes . it should have been a bracing , enthralling experience watching blake's deceptions -- and his very self-created identify -- crumble piece by piece . toback , unfortunately , doesn't let the audience in on the process of figuring this guy out . instead , every possible bit of sub-text is turned into blunt , frequently awkward text . dialogue becomes a steady stream of diagnosis , a " you need everyone to love you " bouncing off of an " i think you want to believe that . " there's even a poster of seminal menage-a-trois film jules et jim on blake's wall to offer insight by conspicuous set decoration . everyone and everything on screen screams at blake exactly what his problem is , giving us barely a moment to consider what _we_ think blake's problem is . that's a near-criminal waste of the complexity and intensity downey pours into his performance . there are clear parallels between this character -- a charming , self-deluding actor -- and downey's own much-publicized inner demons , parallels of which toback was clearly aware when he wrote the script with downey in mind . the film's two most riveting scenes find blake alone with those demons . sadly , this isn't a one-man show . wagner improves as the film progresses , but her opening lines are delivered with such plastic spunkiness that it's hard to avoid loathing her on sight . both actresses , however , are victims of a script which never lets them become characters in their own right . it's baffling that after so much wailing and gnashing of teeth , toback's resolution seems to be that blake isn't really such a bad guy -- that he's not all that different from anybody else , that relationships are all about deception anyway so let's give poor blake a break . i'd conclude that blake's story is much more interesting if he is an entirely unique sort of sexual animal , but toback was generous enough to draw my conclusions for me . given downey's troubled history , it's sad to see blake given such a simplistic freudian out for his behavior . apparently , mommy didn't love him enough . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
director : bille august . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity , violence ) running time : 131 minutes . i've been hearing people refer to the new film adaptation of les miserables as " lay miz , " which goes to show what the common frame of reference is going to be . that abbreviated moniker comes , of course , from alain boublil and claude-michel schonberg's immensely popular musical adaptation , which has been selling out theaters around the world for over a decade . they know all this not so much because they are familiar with victor hugo's novel , but because of that musical with its signature waif-and-tricolor iconography . bille august's straightforward rendering of les miserables makes you realize exactly why the story works so well as grand opera . the film is certainly faithful to most basic events of the novel , though it cuts certain characters entirely and chops other encounters down to a bare minimum . it's not textual fidelity which is lacking in les miserables ; it's emotional scope . virtually every scene feels muted , the passions tamed to a state of dignified dissatisfaction . what les miserables really needed was for someone , anyone , to break into song . the stage production captured the sweeping melodrama of hugo brilliantly -- the battles carried a tragic grandeur , the conflicts shook the foundations of society , and the deaths were moments to jerk tears from the driest eyes . there is no substitute for the kind of dramatic economy music or a well-constructed song can provide ; three minutes of furtive conversation between cosette and marius ( hans matheson ) can't create nearly the convincing sense of love at first sight that three minutes of " in my life " does . the film seems to have been crafted and edited strictly to make sure certain necessary plot details were included , with little interest in building momentum towards a cathartic release . from a certain standpoint -- one with no musical preconceptions in the way -- les miserables is perfectly effective as period drama , and a fine introduction to the classic story . technical credits are first rate , with costumes by the gifted gabriella pesucci ( the age of innocence ) and effective recreations of 19th century paris . the exceptional cast does generally sharp work , particularly rush in a more interesting and subtle performance than his oscar-winning showcase of tics and flourishes in shine . often , however , it feels as though august is keeping them all on a leash , eschewing musical theater in favor of " masterpiece theater . " there's no real power to the film , nothing which suggest the popular response inspired by the musical . i suspect that the only viewers who will be genuinely satisfied with les miserables are those who don't come in with radically different expectations in mind . . . expectations see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
most americans first saw lee's work in nike commercials of the late 80s , featuring michael jordan and lee himself as she's gotta have it character mars blackmon . make no mistake , spike loves his hoops . i can't help but feel that love clouded lee's judgment as he put together he got game . the corrupt race to recruit top high school athletes isn't exactly fresh subject matter , having already appeared in the 1994 film blue chips . lee puts a humorous spin on some of the ridiculous excesses of the process , but his real chance at originality would have been putting us inside the head of the young men , most from impoverished backgrounds , facing these dizzying attempts to influence . that's somwhere lee and first-time actor ray allen never take us , allowing us to see the insanity without allowing us to understand how jesus really feels about it . allen looks comfortable enough on screen , but his character is too passive , so fundamentally decent he never seems fazed by anything . lee has a lot of stuff he wants to show us ; jesus's role is more or less to absorb it all . if lee had centered on that relationship , he got game might have been a truly memorable film . there's enough thematic material here for two films ; lee decides to make them both simultaneously . the resulting film feels scattershot , heavy on interesting images and ideas but light on cohesiveness . somewhere in there is an engrossing family drama , often relegated to the nosebleed seats while lee keeps pulling us courtside to watch his inner city story with a basketball backdrop turn into a basketball story . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
director : roland emmerich . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( intense situations , profanity , some violence ) running time : 135 minutes . roland emmerich and dean devlin have thrown down the gauntlet to film critics . . . or , at the very least , to two film critics in particular . i don't know why emmerich and devlin found this snarky fit of retaliatory pique necessary . is critical acceptance so important to the film-makers that doing well isn't good enough as the best revenge ? if such is the case , here's a simple bit of advice for emmerich and devlin : make better movies . godzilla is a baby step in the right direction , if for no other reason than that it's more honest in its big-budget intentions than the dopey and grandiose independence day . using aliens and jurassic park as its models rather than the adventures of its rubber-suited predecessor , godzilla takes only half an hour before the scaly behemoth hits the big apple and turns midtown manhattan into a jurassic parking lot . the sheer variety of situations insures a consistent level of interest , while simultaneously insuring several unique levels for the inevitable sony playstation version of the game . whenever the film rests on human shoulders , however , you could sprain your eyeballs from rolling them . continuing their uncanny knack for inane back-story , emmerich and devlin create a mayo-on-white-bread relationship dynamic between broderick and pitillo , and a mission for reno which makes less and less sense every moment i think about it . the dialogue is hopelessly feeble , the attempts at humor strained even by action movie standards , and the characters so caricatured that al hirschfeld should have drawn them . even the always-appealing broderick looks baffled by how to be charming in such a suffocating role . it's a sharp piece of action film-making , and not the only one . yet godzilla can't get by on its big-ness alone ; in fact , the visuals sometimes seem decidedly less than state-of-the-art , particularly when our heroes are threatened inside madison square garden . when a blockbuster exists solely to impress you with " you gotta see this " tricks , it's tough not to be disappointed when you've seen the tricks before , and seen them done better . there are ways around that disappointment , though , which emmerich and devlin should ponder : write better scripts . create real characters . make better movies . either that , or continue blaming the messengers for the way they hold their thumbs . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : whit stillman . director : whit stillman . they talk and talk and talk and talk until amusement at their bon mots gives way to frustration as you begin wishing you could grab every one of them by the collar and beg someone , anyone to do something , anything . what they eventually do -- all they eventually do , really , besides talk -- is dance . these moments anchor a two-pronged approach by stillman to the disco culture . the social angle is occasionally intriguing , but you have to wade through an awful lot of tediousness and sloppy plotting to get to it . it's hard to keep track of the various romantic permutations in the last days of disco , not because stillman tears through the narrative at a breakneck pace but because his characters are so interchangeably earnest and clever . the notable exceptions are eigeman ( a veteran of stillman's previous features ) and beckinsale , who at least add a bit of self-absorbed spice to the proceedings . otherwise it's not easy to care about who ends up with whom , or why stillman muddles through plot devices like an undercover investigation of the club's finances while abandoning the repercussions of one of alice's one-night stands . the scattered comic high points are too subdued to overcome the incongruity between the subject matter and stillman's approach to it . for a film about the flame-out of a flashy era , the last days of disco is just too languid and verbose . only for those few moments when the music starts and the talking stops does the film feel like it's got to be real . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
director : andrew davis . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , violence ) running time : 110 minutes . you'll be seeing ads for a perfect murder trumpeting " from the director of the fugitive , " which should set off a few alarms . if you're inclined to do the math , you'll note that the fugitive came out five years ago , and you might reasonably wonder what mr . davis has been up to in the interrim . the answer is two films warner bros . is hoping everyone has long forgotten : the bloated , laughless caper comedy steal big , steal little and the bloated , lifeless action film chain reaction . those films too were advertised as " from the director of the fugitive , " only the director of the fugitive never showed up . could davis finally display the film-making skill which once held viewers on the edge of their seats , but seems to have been in hibernation for half a decade ? i'm pleased to note that davis directs a perfect murder with much more of the style and savvy which characterized the fugitive . too bad the script is such a mess . douglas in particular gives the material a welcome edge , pitching tart dialogue with a superior sneer and making it supremely satisfying to watch his plans go awry . davis' production team , including production designer philip rosenberg and cinematographer dariusz wolski , creates an appropriately gothic atmosphere to complement tautly-directed individual sequences . all these elements are crafted by davis into a satisfying package likely to keep you intrigued as long as your watching . watch out for the drive home , though , when the whole thing may fall apart in your head so fast you'll lose sight of the road . on the one hand , a perfect murder contains as many metaphorically unfired guns as any film in the history of post-chekhovian drama . why doesn't it matter that emily is multi-lingual ? why is one character left conspicuously wounded-but-not-necessarily-dead , never to appear again ? on the other hand , it underlines some of its key plot points so blatantly ( insert lingering close-up of meat thermometer here ) that it's more than vaguely insulting , then drops key clues into the narrative from out of nowhere . add to that a story which dumps intellectual gamesmanship for struggles over a gun , and it's no wonder the film went back before the cameras for 11th-hour re-shoots of its final scenes . i suppose it's a credit to how much davis does right that a perfect murder still pushes plenty of the right buttons until the anti-climactic climax . if a director is lucky , he gets a good script he can make even better with stylistic choices . on other occasions , the best he can do is apply makeup to all the blemishes . between the film's mood and its solid performances , a perfect murder is about as strong a film as you can make from such feeble material . it may not be redemption for " the director of the fugitive , " but it sure is a step in the right direction . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : nat maudlin and larry levin , based on the stories by hugh lofting . director : betty thomas . mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , adult humor ) running time : 85 minutes . i'm not sure exactly when it happened , but a sad development has seized juvenile comedy as we know it . only token film-makers like the farrelly brothers ( kingpin , dumb and dumber ) have resisted what i call the john hughes-ification of low-brow humor : the insistence upon wrapping up 90 minutes of crude sight gags with a great big group hug and an edifying life lesson . in effect , it's a con playing on the low-level guilt of viewers who want to convince themselves that the bodily function humor is just a necessary evil on the way to an important social message . and i'll bet they read playboy for the articles , too . some viewers obviously manage to get past this dichotomy . personally , i don't want any metaphorical chocolate in my peanut butter . doctor dolittle takes a salty little dab of peanut butter and smothers it in chocolate syrup . doctor dolittle has plenty of predictable charms , most of them connected to the digitally-doctored menagerie surrounding the good doctor . the a-list voice talent -- norm macdonald as the sarcastic family mutt , albert brooks as a depressed circus tiger , julie kavner and garry shandling as a pair of bickering pigeons -- offers plenty of appeal , though prominently-featured chris rock as a guinea pig can only crank up the volume on his rather boring lines . it's hardly classic comedy , but it's effective enough for a few belly laughs , even with the obligatury use of various animal calls of nature by screenwriters nat maudlin and larry levin . low-brow comedy isn't the problem ; lacking the nerve to stick with low-brow comedy is . actually , it would have been nice if murphy had gotten back to any tricks at all . murphy can be a brilliant comic performer , but he works his finest magic as an instigator . aside from a few token moments of frantic behavior , he is asked merely to react in doctor dolittle , to play straight man to the talking animals , which is a huge waste of his talents . i suppose it made sense to try another wacky re-make after the success of the nutty professor , and i suppose it made sense to hope that director betty thomas ( the brady bunch movie , private parts ) could work similar slight-of-hand with another premise that didn't sound very promising . it may have seemed like a good idea at the time , but doctor dolittle only works until you realize it would have worked much better with murphy -- and the whole film -- let off the leash of excess sincerity . when the guffaws give way to solemnly-intoned platitudes , it spoils all the fun of a good pigeon-crap-on-the-head gag . of course , i only watch for the important social message . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
watch radha mitchell long enough , and i'll bet you'll start seeing a young mariel hemingway . watch high art long enough , and i'll bet you'll start seeing a heroin-chic spin on personal best . the " lesbian awakening " genre may hardly rival the mis-matched buddy comedy in sheer weight of numbers , but the conventions are just as conventional in their own way : wide-eyed naif , experienced older woman , tentative first steps , heartfelt discusson over what the wide-eyed naif really wants , oppressive earnestness . been there , done that , seen it all . there's one thing in high art , however , that i can virtually guarantee you haven't seen before : ally sheedy as a serious actress . sheedy's performance alone is nearly enough to recommend high art , and you can color me as stunned as anyone that you're reading those words . sheedy inhabits the character -- a woman who wants to return to her art but doesn't know if her past will permit it -- with an intensity only autobiographical subtext can provide sometimes . the impish grin of the teen star of wargames and the breakfast club now nestles in the lines of a haggard , drawn , aged-beyond-her-years face ; you can see the spark under there somewhere , ready for an opportunity to burst out . sadly , the rest of lisa cholodenko's script -- an inexplicable award-winner at sundance -- strands sheedy's performance in a sea of cliches and muddled relationships . it also makes syd's sexual awakening the center of the story , then fails to develop the character with anything near the necessary depth . everything about high art tells us we should understand syd's ambition , her emptiness , her readiness to be part of lucy's wasteland milieu , but cholodenko assumes too much and shows too little . like too many screenwriters , cholodenko assumes that situation will carry the story , leaving us with characters whose relationsihps feel like plot devices . though the seedy art-clique atmosphere adds a different dynamic , high art is still a formulaic film with little dramatic urgency . the urgency that does emerge comes entirely from ally sheedy , whose own awakening provides a far more fascinating story than the one cholodenko wrote . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : john eskow and ted elliott & terry rossio . producers : david foster and doug claybourne . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 137 minutes . most significantly , in both cases the character himself is larger than life -- all you need to do is put him on screen and you're halfway to satisfying the audience . it's a frustrating waste of effort to watch a character like that dwarfed by a typically over-blown contemporary action film structure . what a shame no one had enough confidence in the actor , or the character . the two make a decent enough pair -- alejandro the impulsive pupil and de la vega his graying yoda -- but the mask of zorro only truly comes to life when banderas is front and center , clad in black . in the few set pieces where banderas gets to whirl into action , whether crossing swords as zorro or burning up the dance floor with elena while posing as a nobleman , he's an electrifying presence , a genuine movie star giving the audience a grand show . in this bloated production , however , it's hard to keep focused on the dash and flash of zorro . the length is padded by the obligatory back story introducing us to the " origin " of the new zorro , as well as a ridiculous sword fight between zorro and elena which offers stilted banter and a pg-13-preserving disrobing thanks to strategically placed hair . mostly , the story by ted elliott and terry rossio ( the summer's busiest writing team , with credits on godzilla and small soldiers as well ) has the generic feel of an action film just one re-write removed from being a bond vehicle . the setting has a back-lot blandness to it without the back-lot charm of swashbuckling melodrama . you may be pleading for something as restrained as the finale of a typical bond adventure by the time the mask of zorro reaches its climactic showdown at a gold mine . the whole thing culminates , naturally , in an endless 50-powder-kegs-and-a-cloud of dust explosion where the zeal of the pyrotechnicians is topped only by the sound effects guys' goofy decision to make it sound like they just blew up a pack of dyspeptic mountain lions . so much for an adventure which primes you to cheer for a great hero . banderas' appeal alone may be just enough to win over some viewers ; the waste of that appeal , and of the man in black's commanding image , made me long for some heroic figure to come along and make a few strategic slashes in the editing room . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
mafia ! , like its predecessors airplane ! , the naked gun and hot shots ! , is a scorecard comedy . their goal has always been to throw as many puns , sight gags , movie parodies and bodily function gags onto the screen as 90 minutes could hold , operating on the premise that you gotta keep swinging if you wanna get hits . at the end of the film , a viewer's reaction is likely to be a subconscious evaluation of the jokes' batting average . if hits exceed whiffs , everybody wins ; if whiffs exceed hits , not so much . has two strikes against it before it even shows up at the ballpark , the first and most obvious being its satiric target . entrenched though the films and their situations may be in the cinematic canon , mafia ! just feels stale , as topical as a joey buttafuoco joke or a reference to bella abzug's hats . at least the godfather films will be well-known to most average viewers , though . the other major reference points are martin scorsese's mob-themed films goodfellas and casino . the number of gags baed on the latter film , including the opening credits sequence and the character of pepper ( pamela gidley , a dead ringer for sharon stone ) , is utterly baffling given casino's less-than-spectacular box office performance . references to more recent , more familiar films like forrest gump and the english patient draw big chuckles , while the casino references draw mostly blank stares . ( though curiously that title still appears on-screen ) , but no one gave nearly as much thought to the actual content of the film . the second strike is the " trailer factor , " which is always a danger with a broad comedy like mafia ! since virtually none of the jokes are contextual , and 90% of them can be conveyed in a matter of moments , the people who put together theatrical trailers and television spots are free to plunder the film for all the best laughs . it's easy to pull 120 seconds worth of " a " material from mafia ! , sight gags like a shattering poodle and an overweight ersatz river-dancer , but you're sadly mistaken if you think that's a representative sample . if you've seen that theatrical trailer for mafia ! , with its two-minute barrage of great bits , you've probably laughed about as hard as you're going to laugh at the whole 85 minues of the film . comedies like mafia ! are usually entertaining just for forcing you to pay attention . dozens of decent laughs hover around the perimeter of the frame , while several of the best moments come during the closing credits , including a great riff on the standard " no animals were harmed during the making of this film " disclaimer . it's the jokes abrahams places front and center which drop with a thud just a bit too often . as just one example of the lackluster writing , the " guess what number i'm thinking of " table in one casino scene is a joke swiped from vegas vacation . . . and abrahams offers plenty of moments worth a snicker or a grin , but ultimately that laugh scorecard just doesn't come out in his favor . for those of you scoring at home , that doesn't add up to winning offense . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : james demonaco and kevin fox . producers : arnon milchan and david hoberman . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 137 minutes . sometimes it's obvious that a film isn't about the plot , it's about the names above the title . cocktail was no more a coming-of-age story than it was a geopolitical thriller ; it was about tom cruise smiling and mixing drinks . up close and personal was about as interested in journalistic ethics as the national enquirer ; it was really about robert redford and michelle pfeiffer sharing soft-focus love scenes . and could you differentiate between any two non-terminator schwarzenegger action films with a gun to your head ? for better or for worse -- more often the latter , contemporary hollywood films often sell personalities rather than stories . no , the negotiator is about a showdown between jackson and spacey , two actors whose intensity and burning intelligence make them magnetically watchable . even with theatrical trailers awash in spraying bullets and shattering glass , you expect that the real warfare will be psychological , a chess match as much between jackson and spacey as between the characters they play . if the negotiator had delivered on that promise , it would have been one of those rare exceptions where a " personality plot " would have been the right choice . for all the sound and fury surrounding both the conspiracy and the attempts to take roman by force , the negotiator is built on the clash of two characters who win not by shooting faster , but by thinking faster , by turning words into their most effective weapons . jackson and spacey take the two similar roles and turn them into distinct individuals so deftly that the slices of family life provided as back-story seem embarrassingly clumsy by contrast . the flicker of instability which makes it possible to believe he'd kill contrasts perfectly with the icy resolve of spacey's sabian . when those two characters lock wits and eyes , each struggling to size the other up and determine whether he's an ally or an adversary , the negotiator is compelling stuff . those moments just don't come nearly often enough . spacey doesn't make his first appearance until nearly 45 minutes have passed , leaving plenty of time for the film to detour onto well-worn action-suspense avenues . though paul giamatti ( fast becoming the most recognizable unknown actor in movies ) provides solid comic relief as a con artist among roman's hostages , even the one-liners further emphasize that this drama really isn't anything special . it could have been and should have been more than another die hard clone , more than an over-long mystery where you begin to feel you should leave as soon as you figure out the real bad guy . the negotiator should have played to the strength of its cast , with more scenes of roman reducing his colleagues to blubbering bowls of putting , or sabian taking control of a room with the force of his confidence . it's a disappointing reverse-tease : with two great stars to show off , it has the nerve to go and offer us a plot . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
did you ever get the feeling that brian depalma designs entire films around set pieces he thinks would be really cool ? think about mission : impossible -- can you recall more than a few scattered seconds aside from the computer room break-in and the train tunnel finale ? the trivial business of building a story between cool sequences frequently seems to bore him ; if there were a directorial equivalent for " script doctor , " he'd probably be all over it . that opening reel is a nice piece of work , and an ideal showcase for cage at his bug-eyed , manically-grinning finest . there's a kinetic artistry to the scene as depalma captures the excitement at the event , the shark-like constant motion of our protagonist , and the unstable nature of the events about to occur . we recognize instantly that for every pie in atlantic city , there's rick santoro with his fingers deeply immersed or doing his best to dip them in . we also recognize that somewhere in the dizzying scene are the clues to what will come next . what will come next is an investigation of the shoting which often feels like an afterthought . the story's arc is clearly designed to lead santoro towards a redemptive choice -- cash vs . the right thing -- but it seems to take an awful lot longer than 90 minutes to get there . and that's not to say that snake eyes doesn't move . in fact , depalma rarely stops moving , mixing up extended point-of-view sequences with tautly-edited pursuits , throwing in a drifting overhead pan through a series of hotel rooms for good measure . snake eyes has technical virtuosity and sheer forward momentum to spare . what's missing is heart , a reason to care about stringing depalma's shiny individual baubles together into cinematic jewelry . by the climax , depalma seems to have lost all focus on making snake eyes a redemption thriller , hinging a pivotal sequence on a turn of the weather . between that stormy sequence , the extended speeches in which the villains explain their motivation , and the tagged-on romantic coda , you may find yourself wondering what the point of it all could be . i suppose snake eyes could satisfy an audience as a display of craftsmanship , but that really defines why so few of depalma's films satisfy as stories . he's not really a film-maker . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
producers : peter frankfurt , wesley snipes and robert engelman . director : stephen norrington . mpaa rating : r ( violence , gore , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 118 minutes . blade is a comic book adaptation , which in recent years has meant you could expect one of two approaches : brooding and violent ( the crow , spawn ) or gaudy and hyper-kinetic ( batman and robin , the mask , tank girl ) . blade is no exception . . . sort of . instead of choosing one familiar path or the other , the makers of blade have chosen both -- it's brooding , gaudy , violent _and_ hyper-kinetic . the surprising good news is that it comes impressively close to succeeding at both . the bad news is that means it doesn't entirely succeed at either one . the premise alone is intriguing enough to give it a fair shot . flash forward to the present day , where that son has grown up to be blade ( wesley snipes ) , a hybrid with all the strength of a vampire but none of the weaknesses -- he can walk in daylight with impunity , eat a pizza with extra garlic , and so on . all right , the latter portion doesn't qualify as any sort of intriguing . it's more in that gaudy and hyper-kinetic category , a climactic conclusion to two hours of punishing , extremely sanguine action . it's also extremely effective action , directed by former special effects make-up artist stephen norrington at the kind of blistering pace generally associated with jackie chan films . make no mistake , blade _moves_ , with dynamic fight sequences and a parade of gruesome special effects -- exploding vampire heads , disintegrating vampire bodies , vampire skeletons crawling out of their skins . with snipes anchoring the action as the chiseled anti-hero , blade's frenzied , over-the-top battles offer plenty of visceral thrills . of course , it has to pause every once in a while for exposition , which usually is where films of this kind collapse into a puddle of stupidity . blade , on the other hand , teases with provocative concepts that ultimately go nowhere . when the militant deacon rejects the assimilation tactics of his elders in favor of " vampire power , " it could have been the basis for more complex themes than you'd ever expect from a comic book thriller . is blade , for all his righteous wrath , merely engaging in a sort of " ethnic cleansing ? " interesting questions , if anyone had bothered to ask them . unfortunately , the politics of vampirism quickly gives way to simple , rapid-fire good guy vs . bad guy stuff . blade keeps setting you up to expect that the sub-text is going to matter somehow , then always bails out for another round of spinning back-kicks and shotgun blasts . i suppose you could take a glass-half-full view and applaud both the quality of the action and the mere attempt to give depth to the viscera . there's just too much viscera , and not enough depth , to take that attempt seriously . it's an exciting under-achiever -- to brooding to be pure gaudy fun , to gaudy to let its brooding go anywhere interesting . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
it's a story with sex , drugs _and_ rock 'n' roll , as well as colorful characters a-plenty . sure enough , this bio-pic offers loads of curb appeal . unfortunately , andrews and director gregory nava ( selena ) make a big mistake in their approach to the material -- they decide to turn it into a rock 'n' roll rashomon . somewhere buried in that narrative is an interesting -- if somewhat trite -- entertainment industry life story , the story of a street kid from an abusive home who becomes dependent on the love he receives from audiences and women . larenz tate does a fine job of capturing frankie's electrifying stage presence , as well as his sheer joy of performing for a crowd . in fact , the high-energy performance scenes are generally the film's best , with frankie's unbridled on-stage enthusiasm contrasting sharply with the conservative choreography of his artistic contemporaries . tate also has the thankless job of creating a character out of piecemeal recollections , yet the character still comes together as someone you want to know more about . if only wanting made it so . only occasionally does why do fools fall in love hone in on the question of who frankie lymon really was . the individual snapshots of his life , including such potentially provoactive subjects as his naive disregard for 1950s social conventions , never seem designed to develop into a complete portrait . that's what's most disappointing about why do fools fall in love : it's not really a biography of frankie lymon . the film-makers are usually more interested in getting inside the the heads of the three women -- providing tart dialogue for the three talented lead actresses while making them sympathetic , mis-used you-go-girls -- than getting inside frankie's head . sure , they violate point of view when it serves their purpse to show things none of the narrators could have seen , but mostly they point out how frankie's enigmatic behavior hurt others , not how he hurt himself . it's a cop-out to start telling a character's story , then shrug your shoulders and claim not to have any idea who that character is . tina andrews spent fifteen years waiting to tell the story of a potentially fascinating rock 'n' roll tragedy , but all she could come up with was a great big " i dunno .

producers : laurence mark and roger birnbaum . director : mark steven johnson . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity ) running time : 113 minutes . at least they prepared me right off the bat , right there in the credits . i didn't need to wait long to understand how many liberties , thanks to an admirably forthright screen credit : " suggested by the novel _a prayer for owen meany_ . " not " inspired by , " not " based on , " not even " loosely based on " like the 1995 travesty of _the scarlet letter_ . i wish i had known johnson was taking suggestions , because i might have offered a few . right about there , all similarity to the source material ends . sure , a few individual details remain , notably a school christmas pageant which goes dreadfully awry , but even that element is given an ill-advised twist . the film's simon , like his literary counterpart , has a preternaturally mature sense of existential purpose , an almost arrogant belief that god intends great things for him . it makes no sense for that character -- who schemes in the novel to be the baby jesus in the nativity play because he thinks only he can do the role justice -- to be turned into a grumpy and reluctant christ-child . johnson goes for the cheap laughs of projectile vomiting and pre-pubescent groping rather when he should be trying to maintain some consistency in his characterizations . i don't mean to suggest that simon birch is an awful film , particularly if you walk in like most viewers with no knowledge of irving's novel . the friendship between joe and simon is unique and well-developed , though the more experienced mazzello makes first-time screen actor smith look quite self-conscious at times . the first half of simon birch is generally satisfying , a sprightly and quirky reminiscence cast in the autumn tones of aaron e . schneider's cinematography . it's the latter half , which diverges most sharply from irving's story , that goes most horribly wrong . the music score ( by the ever-cloying marc shaiman ) begins reminding us every several seconds that it's time to weep , eventually building to the orchestral equivalent of yanking out your nose hairs one at a time . with its " oh by the way , in case you're a complete moron , here's the moral of the story " punch line of dialogue , simon birch is less emotionally cathartic than it is emotionally insulting . johnson doesn't just streamline irving's sprawling narrative , he dumb-lines it , casting everything in the broadest tear-jerker strokes . what a waste of a singular story to turn it into a trite hallmark card of a dramatic experience . the power of suggestion sure can make people do foolish things . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
here's the faint praise with which i ultimately damn the governess : while i was consistently interested in the film , i'm not sure i could tell you what the point of it all was . we know that rosina is a stranger in a strange land ; will the central conflict be a clash of cultures ? the answer to these questions and more is a resounding " sort of . " yet all the rich background provided by writer/director sandra goldbacher teases without adding up to enough . most disappointing of all is the lack of interest goldbacher shows in developing her secondary characters . mrs . cavendish , a potentially touching portrait of repressed longing , instead becomes comic relief described as though " she had a lemon stuck up her bottom . " even more mysterious is young henry , whose obsession with rosina may be an act of rebellion , or perhaps a fleeting adolescent crush , or perhaps some mixture of the two . in any case , it certainly doesn't mean enough for a lingering scene of henry writhing naked in the surf to provide anything more than the film's _second_ gratuitous penis shot . driver's strong , sensual performance as rosina and wilkinson's turn as the conflicted charles do fill in plenty of gaps , but it's tough to get caught up in a romantic square composed of one real woman , half an identifiable man , a pale and petulant enigma , and a stick figure wrapped in a shawl . all the time that might have been spent sorting out their motivations is spent instead on a metaphor so massively obvious you might trip over it on your way out into the lobby . leaving aside rosina's forrest gump-like discovery of the darkroom and the concept of saline solution developing , the entire photography angle feels like one long attempt to distinguish between our two principal characters -- she wants to capture human faces ( i . e . what we don't see is what this has to do with any of the other cultural or sociological tidbits goldbacher drops along the way . driver's rosina is a compelling enough presence that you'll want to put the pieces together , but you'll find far more ambition than resolution . the governess fairly drowns in context desperately seeking some content . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : jim kouf and ross lamanna . director : brett ratner . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , profanity ) running time : 96 minutes . life , they say , is all about trade-offs , but rush hour asks for a trade-off that just doesn't seem fair : in order to watch jackie chan in action , you've gotta listen to chris tucker in action . chan is one of the most engaging performers in films , a creater of ingenious martial artistry whose personal charm makes his jaw-dropping stunt work even more fun to watch . tucker , on the other hand , may be the funniest guy on the planet some day , but i'll never know it until he stops reading every line in the mellifluous tones usually associated with a circular saw . chan is great ; tucker is grating . rush hour balances the two nearly perfectly , creating a synthesis that is pure cinematic mediocrity . i suspect tucker might have been thinking of rush hour as his beverly hills cop , a chance to play the street-wise rebel with a badge in an action comedy setting . there's no question that he has his adherents -- the folks in the theater who were howling with glee and stomping their feet at his every bug-eyed shriek -- but i can't see tucker crossing over into the kind of broad popularity enjoyed by eddie murphy . the reason is quite simple : where murphy generally seems amused by the foibles of his on-screen foils , tucker seems perpetually irritated . every canned insult he spews makes him that much more unpleasant to spend time with -- not exactly the vibe you're looking for in a leading man . director brett ratner may not have the visual flair of chan's frequent collaborator stanley tong , but he's smart enough to get out of the way and let chan do his thing ( some sloppy editing choices notwithstanding ) . a jackie chan fight sequence still has the ability to dazzle the way no other fight sequence can , mixing silly bits of business with lighting-fast choreography . rush hour is nothing but fun when it's nothing but a showcase for chan , whether he's fighting bad guys while trying to protect a priceless piece of chinese pottery from harm , or scaling walls and trees in a manner more feline than human . on paper , the collaboration between chan and tucker probably looked like an ideal match of opposites -- one the self-deprecating physical comedian , the other the self-aggrandizing verbal comedian . rush hour is less a jackie chan/chris tucker film than it is a jackie chan film alternating with a chris tucker film , each performer taking turns yanking the predictable material into his preferred comfort zone . if you're a fan of both lead actors , you'll probably get the double-barreled rush the makers of rush hour were aiming for . if you're like me , you'll find it misfiring as often as it hits its target . only then could i safely and happily suspend my disbelief . only then could i forget what i had been forced to endure from the other half of the star tandem . trade-offs can be so cruel . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
director : david veloz . in the last few minutes of permanent midnight , writer/director david veloz introduces a jarring element of irony to what had been a fairly straightforward dark night of the soul drama . the film's coda shows stiller-as-stahl , having written his confessional autobiography , appearing on a series of television talk shows to promote the book and bare his soul . in one of the film's best lines , stahl explains in voice-over that the most humiliating thing he ever did as the result of his addiction was " appearing on 'maury' . " a good gag , but also a pretty self-serving one . in an era when celebrity mea culpas are just another part of the public relations landscape , a film like permanent midnight has to work extra hard to function as an honest cautionary tale rather than a plea to love me , feel sorry for me , let me back into your hearts . the film makes sure we know about stahl's troubled family life , including two suicidal parents , which already suggests that stahl and/or writer/director david veloz is pointing fingers outward as much as inward . watching the character pitch his book -- which , of course , became the movie we're watching -- takes every harrowing moment which preceded and makes it cheap and exploitative . that's truly a shame , because stahl's story is given a harrowing conviction by ben stiller's performance . though best known as a comic in films like the hit there's something about mary , stiller is a versatile performer who makes heroin addiction about as ugly as we've ever seen it . it's funny yet pathetic watching stahl trying with a ridiculous lack of success to disguise his stupors as artistic eccentricity ; even other self-absorbed hollywood types instantly recognize that he's utterly useless . what's fascinating about stiller's performance is that there's never a moment when his character appears to be functional as an addict . unfortunately , there's nothing besides stiller's performance to make us care about permanent midnight . there's not much at stake as we watch stahl disintegrate , nor is there a particular reason to care if he's earned his second chance at love . he's just another cleaned-up hollywood junk-head with a tale to tell , probably one of a thousand . the last five minutes of permanent midnight are as ill-conceived as any five minutes of film this year , because they make it look like stahl is just a different kind of self-absorbed now . you're left with the uncomfortable feeling that for him , addiction is just a marketing hook . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : robin swicord , akiva goldsman and adam brooks , based on the novel by alice hoffman . director : griffin dunne . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 104 minutes . practical magic cast a sort of spell over me , but i don't think it's the kind a film-maker might have intended . rather than enchantment , it produced a spell of befuddlement . it's not so much a movie as it is a big bubbling cauldron of confusion into which a mess of ingredients have been tossed . among the items included in this concoction : it's an obvious hook for a female empowerment fable , one that plays female viewers for every whoop and cheer it can wrest out of them , but it doesn't quite mix with other ingredients like . . . though the scenes of supernatural nastiness are sporadic , they're nonetheless jarring . as the owens women attempt a climactic exorcism of sorts -- joined by a bunch of townswomen who had until that point loathed the sisters , but decided to help out because , darn it , that's just what women do for one another -- you may wonder who took your saucy romantic comedy and dipped it in the witches of eastwick . that's assuming you still care by that point , given . . . in the midst of the magical hijinks surrounding her , bullock plays her mourning far too straight , as though the film were a deeply observational relationsihp drama . she should have taken a hint from her co-stars , all of whom appear to be having a heck of a lot more fun . and it could have been a strange delight thanks to . . . here he offers a few of his cock-eyed touches , including a midnight tequila party and gillian's surreal time-lapsed drive home , but there's no focus to the story . it's a comedy that gets too serious , a crowd-pleaser that turns too bizarre , and a romantic love story that suddenly turns into a sisterly love story . it's certainly never a bore , not with kidman throwing off sparks and so many shifts in tone . it also never comes together as anything more than the sum of its disparate parts . i'm not sure what the recipe for practical magic was supposed to create , but it adds up to a casserole of clashing flavors , a supernatural stew with the power to create a fog of ambivalence . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : marc levin , richard stratton , bonz malone , saul williams and sonja sohn . director : marc levin . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , sexual situations ) running time : 100 minutes . slam appeals to everything critics want movies to be . it tells a story of a side of american life most of us are lucky enough never to see . it has a unique narrative rhythm , and a gritty , uncompromising style . it's an idea movie , one that clearly wants its audience to walk out pondering its weighty themes rather than humming a theme song or grinning from ear to ear . it comes with the pedigree of an award-winning documentary film-maker directing his first feature film , and a sundance film festival grand prize . it is not , however , a great film . in fact , it's not even a particularly good one . slam virtually bubbles and boils with provocative concepts and viscerally effective scenes . though at first it seems like it may be little more than a liberal tract on hard lives , inequities in the judicial system and the like , the film probes a bit deeper , questioning whether ray is part of the solution or part of the problem . it's also hard not to feel a charge from the scene in which ray defuses a potential fight in the prison workout yard by bursting into a poem of paralyzing ferocity . with levin occasionally toning down the strident voice for a few wry observations ( including malone's smooth turn as the prison entrepreneur and marion barry's cameo as a trial judge waxing ironically indignant about drug dealing ) , slam at its best does manage to grab hold of you . then , nearly as quickly , it'll let you go again . slam depends almost entirely on gripping you in the thrall of its intensity , but that doesn't always happen with a pair of inexperienced lead actors handling the most challenging material . saul williams doesn't have the chops to handle ray's complex character arc , nor can sonja sohn always handle lauren's didactic role . that leads to scenes where the two merely shout at each other with a discouraging lack of subtlety . as comfortable as they may be with the rat-a-tat , stream-of-insanity style of their poetry ( showcased in scenes at coffee house poetry " slams " ) , it often feels like that's the only note they can bring to their performances . make no mistake , levin and his cast understand this milieu , and the sincerity of their conviction is never in doubt . their film-making instincts are another matter entirely . from moment to moment , levin alternates between compelling realism and the pretentious whiff of conspicuous symbolism -- a gangsta who becomes enlightened after he is blinded , for instance , or the hollowly open-ended final shot . slam is its own kind of tone poem , i suppose , its success riding on the strong accented beats provided by a few individually effective scenes . yet ultimately that's all it is -- a collection of emotional iambs , alternately engrossing and meandering . sincerity can only get you so far , even when you're telling a story everyone would like to have told . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : trey parker . mpaa rating : nc-17 ( sexual content , profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 95 minutes . it's the film so daring that it earned a rare nc-17 rating ! it's the film so controversial that universal pictures , the parent company of october films , forced october to create a separate releasing arm to distance itself from the film ! it's the film so outrageous that only trey parker , the bad-boy co-creator of " south park , " could have brought it to you ! it's orgazmo , a film destined for midnight movie immortality ! they say there's no such thing as bad publicity . . . unless you're a potential film viewer who pays attention to it . anyone expecting naughty , edgy fun from orgazmo might find that its most shocking surprise is how uninspired much of its " outrageousness " is . occasionally , it looks like parker is going to take this story on just the right avenue of absurdity . there are a few amusing gags sprinkled throughout orgazmo , many aimed at the absurdity of adult film " plot " scenarios when they're not taking broad shots at utah or the latter-day saints . the problem with parker's sense of humor is that it can be terribly lazy . until eventually -- inevitably -- he actually makes a pass at another male character . you can see punch lines coming from several theaters away in orgazmo . those who might attend just for prurient interest should also be warned that orgazmo is about as tame as an nc-17 film could get . though there's plenty of full-clothed grinding and prominent displays of certain marital aids , there's nary an exposed female body part to be found ( hairy male buttocks , on the other hand , get a disturbing amount of screen time ) . make no mistake , trey parker's brand of offensiveness is far more sniggering , middle-of-the-road crude than it is truly shocking . there's nothing wrong with the production being sloppy and amateurish ; after all , this is among other things a parody of porno films , with a wonderfully cheesy fake explosion for a conclusion . it's another thing when the humor is often sloppy and amateurish . . . or worse yet , re-cycled . orgazmo inspires the one reaction a " daring , " " controversial , " " outrageous " film can't afford : a great big " so what ?

the pieces are familiar , but they don't quite fit together . extended , surrealistic , dialogue-free musical interludes are used to advance character and set tone . campy dialogue , gaudy costumes and ambiguous sexuality flourish . speculative romantic connections are established between roman-a-clef versions of pop music stars , accompanied by effectively pseudo-period new songs . it's citizen kane meets pink floyd the wall , the rocky horror picture show meets grace of my heart . and that's saying nothing of the suggestion that oscar wilde , the father of flamboyance , was an alien progeny . welcome to the evocative , provocative world of writer/director todd haynes , the man who used barbie dolls to tell the story of karen carpenter in the little-seen underground film superstar , and who fashioned a sublime , complex cautionary tale about environmental and psychological collapse in safe . in velvet goldmine , a fictionalized account of the early 70s glam rock scene , haynes takes a somewhat appropriate style over substance approach . the center of the story is the rise and fall of ziggy stardust . . . i velvet goldmine is less a narrative than it is a long-form music video , intriguing images full of manufactured outrageousness ( including the bizarre oscar wilde prologue ) . as such , it certainly re-creates its era effectively . the music , the mood and the theatricality are all pure glam ; rhys meyers looks perfectly the part as pop creation already beginning to eat itself . but haynes piles stylish surface on top of stylish surface in velvet goldmine until it never quite gets at the heart of anything -- not the artists , not the appeal of glam , not even whether the scene was about social change or filthy lucre . it certainly comes awfully close on occasion . in one wonderfully cross-cut sequence , arthur's sexual awakening is connected to the sexual excesses of slade's entourage , suggesting that even in their self-absorption the glam rockers -- often tormented as children for their sexual individuality -- succeeded at expanding boundaries for other youth . yet even this storyline spins into an absurd , pointless conspiracy-mystery which arthur could have put together only by actually viewing footage from the film we're watching . that's the kind of infatuation with his own film-making that haynes displays in velvet goldmine . because it's always visually engrossing , it keeps holding out the hope that it's going somewhere substantial . instead , it offers the cinematic equivalent of hip-hop sampling , turning into a montage of visual and musical cues from other pieces of popular cinema ; haynes even cribs from superstar with a romantic scene between two dolls . if glam was somehow about the fine line between profound and shallow , haynes has hit the mark dead on . this is one deliberately confounding spectacle . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : lawrence wright and menno meyjes & edward zwick . producers : lynda obst and edward zwick . director : edward zwick . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 114 minutes . the makers of the siege probably are throwing up their hands , baffled by the protests voiced by arab-american groups . you can feel co-writer/director edward zwick straining for every possible opportunity to make it clear that the siege is _not_ about arab-bashing . as the siege builds to a series of speeches condemning the idea that extremism in the defense of security is no vice , you know that zwick wants audiences to feel him championing the notion that islam does not equal violent zealotry -- that arab-americans are people too . there's one very important thing missing from the siege , however : a genuine connection to the people who are suffering . the film doesn't spend a second of personal time with a character actually interned in a detention camp , nor with individuals tortured by the military for information , nor with anyone victimized by anti-arab hate crimes . yes , shalhoub does get dialogue expressing outrage when his teenage son is taken prisoner , but the sentiment feels second-hand and token . during its final hour , the siege becomes a thoroughly generic thriller of chases and speeches -- more interested in being provocative than being empathetic , and more interested in the _idea_ of trampled rights than those whose rights are being trampled . in fact , it's a shame the siege had to go there at all , because its first hour works so well as a crackling police procedure drama . washington shares some exceptional scenes with annette bening as a secretive c . i . a . operative whose agenda may be very personal ; their clashing tactics -- the rule of law vs . the rule of expediency -- make for first rate and surprisingly platitude-free sparring . zwick directs the early action sequences with energy and economy , anchored by the always-satisfying images of determined people going about a difficult job with hard-nosed efficiency . willis himself is a huge part of the problem , taking a potentially complex character and quickly turning him into a sneering caricature of military sadism . even the fundamental honor and decency washington brings to every role starts to seem like sanctimony , because the script isn't serious about getting into the gray areas of individual rights vs . societal needs . the concept deserves more than heroes and villains pointing guns at each other . arab-americans may be troubled by the idea that some arab characters are portrayed as terrorists in the siege . they should be more troubled by the idea that , in a film with such an incendiary premise , arab characters in general are more symbolic than substantial . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : ron osborn & jeff reno and kevin wade and bo goldman . director : martin brest . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 179 minutes . in his attempt to make an epic of the human experience , director martin brest has overburdened a simple story with an entire film's worth of pregnant pauses , portentous glances and flabby plotting . the real shame is that there's two hours of solid material trying to escape from this lengthy remake of death takes a holiday . hopkins , meanwhile , does nice work as the businessman taking stock of his legacy , drawing on the understated physical acting which has always marked his best performances . between every shred of interesting material , however , there are several patience-threatening minutes . superfluous sub-plots drag the film down , including one which requires pitt to adopt an embarrassing west indian accent . that consistent lack of narrative economy ultimately dooms meet joe black in spite of its strengths . there are also some supporting moments which do work quite well , including marcia gay harden as parrish's oldest daughter making a heartbreaking admission of love for her father . meet joe black is a truly gorgeous film , with emmanuel lubezki providing luminous photography of dante ferretti's production design . it's also a case of ever-diminishing returns , with so many emotional confrontations and false endings you may forget whom you were supposed to care about . that film was smart enough to treat the story as grand melodrama -- a weepy transcendental tragedy rather than an oscar-season message movie . life on earth certainly could have seemed more vibrant , and less like an endurance test . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : peter berg . director : peter berg . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , nudity , sexual situations , drug use , adult themes ) running time : 101 minutes . the film's title offers too easy and convenient a bon mot . expect cadres of critics to be trotting out innumerable variations on " very bad things _is_ one of them , " though it's both a cheap analysis and an inaccurate one . very bad things isn't a very bad movie . it's a very good idea approached from entirely the wrong perspective . beneath the macabre , over-the-top situations surrounding the deaths in very bad things is a savage satire of stereotypical gender responses to impending marriage . to laura , it's all just one more logistical glitch to be overcome , with diaz turning in a frighteningly funny vision of a woman whose wedding _will not_ be spoiled by anything . diaz nails the proper tone so completely ( particularly in the film's final act ) that you may suddenly realize what's been so wrong with the rest of the film . while diaz plays laura entirely for absurd laughs , the male cast members range from one extreme to another . slater plays boyd as too sinister to be funny , stern and piven play the brothers berkow as too genuinely tormented to be funny , and favreau plays kyle as too dull to be funny . for much of very bad things , the script by peter berg ( better known from his role on " chicago hope " ) is simply a plot in motion , pulling the characters along with it . at times there's not even exaggerated humanity in the reactions of the characters , the kind that would have given a more humorous spin to more scenes . for a film that could have and should have been a dark comedy , very bad things is too much like the menacing morality play of shallow grave . that kind of tone is going to alienate a lot of viewers , particularly as the situations grow increasingly extreme and gruesome . though very bad things ends with a hilariously horrifying subversion of suburban domestic bliss , it doesn't given you enough reason to stick around for it . comedy can still work when it's caustic , but at some point a film-maker needs to understand that he has to keep an audience laughing at material this dark to keep them from walking away . very bad things is a great opportunity wasted , and that's the _real_ very bad thing . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
producers : mark canton and irving azoff . director : troy miller . mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , mild vulgar innuendo ) running time : 95 minutes . at the half-hour mark of the family fantasy jack frost , the titular character has not yet been reborn as a walking , talking snowman a year after his death thanks to a magic harmonica tune . it's cute , yet utterly weightless . there are worse things , i suppose , than a harmless bit of family shmaltz for the holiday season . keaton is engaging enough as the hustling , slightly immature human jack , goofing with charlie in a way that suggests he's more interested in being a playmate than being a father . there's at least one very lively chase sequence which will charm the young ones , as well as a welcome paucity of inappropriately sniggering content . and it's true that the snowman ( courtesy jim henson's creature shop ) is a nifty creation , just the right combination of classic look and human expressiveness . there are enough giggles and guffaws in jack frost to make it fun for youngsters without either embarrassing parents or boring them entirely to sleep . what makes it hard to swallow is that it's utterly inconsequential while pretending to be both hipper and more emotional than it really is . 'cause if it is , that's not even very clever . " yet despite attempts to show that the film is a bit above its cutesy premise , it's rarely anything more than a syrupy trifle , sentimental without being resonant ( from a story by mark steven johnson , who made the sentimental , resonance-free simon birch ) . one could argue that jack frost isn't really about jack at all , but about charlie ( a generally understated performance by joseph cross ) , in need of closure after the loss of a father he barely knew . even that take on the story doesn't give it any added pull , not when the script keeps adding simplistic touches like a bully who abruptly drops his bullying and helps charlie because he too understands what it's like to be without a dad . eventually it's hard to identify any significant story at all as jack frost becomes more derivative and rushed towards its climax , complete with a final vision of the human jack so reminiscent of ghost i expected " unchained melody " to burst out on the soundtrack . jack frost isn't so much a story as it is a diverting bit of special effects silliness leading up to a sob cue . it taught me something important about what really matters in a film script : a character arc for the protagonist that's not complete before the first plot point . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
director : tom shadyac . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 115 minutes . we've seen this robin williams before , though not much recently . this is robin williams the crowd-pleasing riff-meister , playing the comedy-drama character arc in which he is temporarily sobered by tragedy but eventually emerges triumphant in the lives he has touched with humor . this is the robin williams -- the stand-up comic with the heart of gold -- that we see in patch adams , the fact-based story of a medical student whose unconventional approach to patient care endears him to patients while irritating the establishment . unfortunately , we've never seen this character so compromised by such an aggressively feel-good film . the first half of patch adams certainly belongs to williams the clown , given free rein to do his stuff ; not coincidentally , it's also the most entertaining half . his rebel with the mile-a-minute mind delivers quite a few laughs through an hour of patch adams , but then again , he has to . it's so obvious where this narrative is headed from the moment he enters medical school , williams offers the only spark of invention . even when contending with the hammering pathos of grinning , hairless children , he still has the ability to disarm an audience with a joke . those grinning , hairless children do bode ill for the second half , when patch adams gets serious on us . it's not just that screenwriter steve oedekerk and director tom shadyac ( who teamed up on eddie murphy's the nutty professor ) play to the most cliched devices of emotional manipulation , like a tearful speech over a grave and a pedantic speech in a courtroom setting . what's worse is that they don't understand when _not_ to resort to emotional manipulation . instead of allowing the scene any sort of sensitivity or dignity , they turn it into a romantic interlude , complete with marc shaiman's obtrusive , syrupy underscore ( shaiman's work should be declared a health risk for diabetics ) . patch adams not only dares you not to be uplifted , it jams a forklift under your seat and slowly grinds you into the ceiling of the theater . i know plenty of viewers will be amused enough by williams' antics to consider patch adams worthwhile . i know plenty of viewers will be applauding patch sticking it to big medicine as the end credits roll . patch adams is a calculated , carefully constructed response machine , unencumbered by complexities like making the traditional doctors anything more than ogres . true story or no , this is a vehicle for robin williams as we've known him best and loved him most . he's the non-conformist ready to quip you into submission . . . except that he appears all-too-willing to conform to formulaic roles in formulaic films . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
director : steven zaillian . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity ) running time : 118 minutes . for those unfamiliar with the american legal system -- and count it among your blessings if you are one of them -- it is not generally the stuff of which great drama is made . it is a thing of motions , pleadings , depositions and causes of action , of hundreds of hours spent reading thousands of incoming documents , or redacting thousands of outgoing documents . it is a war of attrition played out in conference rooms , only rarely involving tense attorney-witness confrontations or even-more-tense waits for a verdict . cinematic law is a satisfying fiction ; real law is , for the most part , a laborious game of chicken before an out-of-court settlement . there was every reason to believe that , if anyone could lend a spark to slogging through the legal mire , it would be steven zaillian . this was , after all , the director who made chess both kinetic and poetic in searching for bobby fischer . unfortunately , it pulls all its punches when it comes to giving the story an emotional hook . schlichtmann's conversion from shark to softy is supposed to anchor the film , except that it's far too subtle . in fact , travolta often plays schlichtmann as though his concern is always still about the money , his frustration less about letting his clients down than about letting the big one slip away -- which , frankly , is a more interesting choice . as the film slowly becomes the story of how the woburn case drains all the cash out of schlichtmann and his firm , it slowly drains what little narrative and visual energy it had . certainly much of that energy was supposed to be provided by robert duvall as jerry facher , beatrice's eccentric veteran attorney . i suppose the idea is that he's wily because he passes himself off as such a goof , but the character's tics -- taping up an ancient briefcase covered in snagglepuss decals ; absently bouncing a ball during a phone conversation ; obsessing over the red sox -- are more often distracting than they are entertaining . at least duvall's fussy colorfulness , along with william h . macy's less-mannered breakdown as schlichtmann's nervous accountant , give you something to watch . too often a civil action feels like the sort of lecture in legal maneuvering we see facher give to students at harvard law . it runs out of gas when it runs out of things to tell us , since it lacks characters to engage us . real law makes the appeal of john grisham-esque courtroom melodrama make a lot more sense . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : steve levitt , based on " to see or not see " by oliver sacks . director : irwin winkler . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , nudity , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 127 minutes . it's a shame when a true story gets in the way of a good story . the first half-hour of at first sight focuses largely on the tentative early steps of amy and virgil's romance , and it's wonderfully effective stuff . both lead actors are about as appealing as we've ever seen them -- sorvino aglow with re-awakened sensation , kilmer dropping his recent posing to connect with a fellow actor . at first glance , at first sight is a throwback love story , short on world-changing ramifications but long on gorgeous photography and superb chemistry between sorvino and kilmer . director irwin winkler does a fine job of conveying virgil's initial disorientation , an assault of stimuli on a man with no real visual vocabulary . and for a while , the medical details of virgil's recovery -- such as his challenges with perspective and depth perception -- are undeniably intriguing . the long-term problem with at first sight -- and it becomes quite long indeed -- is that the story becomes less about the relationship between virgil and amy than it does about the relationship between virgil and his sight . it becomes even more frustrating when it becomes evident that at first sight is going to take exactly the same dramatic arc awakenings took . that's when you start to feel every minute of the two hour plus running time , waiting for the inevitable revelations and confrontations which in some cases are twenty or thirty minutes away . the film had too much going for it as a love story to become a medical drama . when fact proves duller than fiction , it's time for a little artistic license . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : willard carrol . director : willard carrol . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , sexual situations ) running time : 118 minutes . playing by heart inspires the question , " how many stories do you need to tell in one film in order to cover the entire spectrum of human relationship dynamics ? " the answer , of course , is that it's actually a trick question ; you can't possibly cover the subject of love in toto over the course of one two-hour feature . the best you can do is make the stories you _do_ choose to tell compelling enough and insightful enough that they feel somehow more universal . writer/director willard carrol , apparently unhip to the tricky nature of the aforementioned question , has answered it " six . " and that's at _least_ two too many . there's an inherent danger in films that include several intertwining stories , namely that some will be much more interesting than others , and that the interesting stories will be less effective because we keep dashing away from them . at least one of the stories is extremely effective -- anderson and stewart's tentative sparring -- thanks largely to the charismatic intelligence of the two actors . two others are consistently diverting -- jolie and phillippe , and connery and rowlands -- again thanks largely to the performers , which is a particular surprise in the former case . but with three other stories vying for time , including the utterly tedious trysts between stowe and edwards , there's never enough time for the good ones to build any momentum . carrol and usually reliable editor pietro scalia ( an oscar-winner for jfk ) chop playing by heart into bite-sized three minute chunklets , giving the film all the emotional resonance of a wittier-than-usual episode of " the love boat . " that wittiness is what carrol is counting on to carry us through playing by heart , a film with more than its share of effective verbal sparring and clever quips . the dialogue makes the episodes diverting a fair amount of the time ; it also disguises a script that has virtually nothing interesting or new to say about relationships . it often feels like carrol is engaged in a decade-late scramble for a " modern " take on love and sex -- incorporating hiv into not one but two of the storylines -- but essentially every one of the stories is about people trying to understand and be understood . it's not a particularly revelatory take on why love is complicated , which makes it even more unclear why carrol had to tell so many stories to say one thing . perhaps it's the sense that carrol is trying _so_ hard that makes playing by heart frustrating in spite of its occasional sparks of life . john barry's score drapes a curtain of strings heavily over too many scenes , vilmos zsigmond's cinematography paints an unbelievably romanticized l . a . nightscape , and the conversations sometimes turn into exchanges that in real life would end with someone getting smacked across the face . yet for all its flaws , playing by heart probably would have worked if it had given us the time to build a familiarity with only one or two couples , allowing us to understand their hopes and fears about love in more depth than a quick character capsule could provide . the moments just don't add up in this epic of the heart that proves the law of diminishing returns . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
the conventional three-act film storytelling structure may not be sacrosanct , but if you're telling a conventional story , it's a really good idea to use it . marketing sets up the audience to expect a specific conflict for the second act , and to expect that certain characters and relationships will be the focal points ; familiarity with other films tells them those elements will appear before they've finished their bags of popcorn . if you give the people what they expect when they're expecting it , you're going to satisfy them nine times out of ten . blast from the past is set up as a romance and a fish-out-of-water comedy , and eventually it is both . it simply takes foooorrreeeeevvveerr to get there . a sensible film-maker would have realized that the webbers' life in the shelter was the set-up for the story , not the story itself . the whole business is handled clumsily , though ; like adam himself , the film waits so long to begin doing the things it should have been doing much earlier , it appears unsure how to do them . how much better spent that first half hour might have been if the real world juxtaposition had been eve's childhood rather than the pointless slotnik character , both for comedic social commentary potential and for plot development purposes . but no such luck -- blast from the past often feels like an assembly-line product made by people who've never seen an assembly line . blast from the past does have its charms , enough not to make the experience completely frustrating . wilson brings a silly energy to the second half of the film , giving it enough cute moments to make it watchable , but he never pulls it all together in a way that's completely satisfying . blast from the past is a pretty lousy execution of a fairly simple idea , a textbook case of a by-the-numbers plot that just doesn't add up . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
message in a bottle ( warner bros . ) starring : kevin costner , robin wright penn , paul newman , illeana douglas . producers : denise di novi , jim wilson and kevin costner . director : luis mandoki . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , sexual situations , profanity ) running time : 135 minutes . you can imagine newman both as a man's man -- a loner dedicated to his craft -- and a ladies' man -- deeply sensitive when touched by the love of a good woman . that's the kind of screen presence you need when you're dealing with one of these mythically appealing romances like the bridges of madison county or the horse whisperer . you need a clint eastwood , or a robert redford . . . or a paul newman . costner . yet here he is in message in a bottle , playing the emotionally unavailable but romantically irresistable garret . he's the kind of guy who loves too deeply , whose gestures of self-sacrifice are the stuff of song and story . it's costner once again as the paradigm , the icon , and i for one didn't believe him for a second . to be fair , costner isn't the only thing wrong with message in a bottle . director luis mandoki's adaptation is a technically glorious piece of work -- beautifully photographed by caleb deschanel , sweepingly scored by gabriel yared -- but it's one heck of a long sit , clocking in at a soggy two hours and fifteen minutes . the storyline parallels theresa's emergence from emotional isolation after a difficult divorce with garret's difficulties letting go of his wife , and does so in fetishistic detail . there's a subplot involving garret's conflict with his embittered in-laws , and the occasional tete-a-tete between dodge and garret or between dodge and theresa , all building with a gruelling lack of tension to one big cathartic payoff . you may leave the theater with your hanky wet , but it could be from the drool that collects while you nod off to sleep just as easily as from tears . lost at sea along the way are extremely effective performances by robin wright penn and paul newman . wright penn is an actress we don't see very much , which allows her still to be an actress in a role like this rather than a movie star . her conflicted pursuit of garret -- a man whose letters should have told her from the start isn't ready to love anyone else -- is convincing in context ; her moments of insecurity and disappointment are genuinely affecting . newman , meanwhile , gets to be gruff in a way that usually turns actors into hams , but turns this veteran into a breath of fresh air . he's so effortlessly charming , it's easy to forget the harlequin sensibility at the heart of message in a bottle and begin enjoying it as human relationship drama . costner , too , can be effortlessly charming , but not here . his interpretation of the role is so focused on garret's internalized mourning that in the moments when he's supposed to be letting go with theresa , he looks like a man trying to act like a grieving man trying to be effortlessly charming . message in a bottle undoubtedly will have its sob appeal , just as the novel did . unlike the film adaptations of the bridges of madison county and the horse whisperer , that's the main thing this one has going for it . it's too bad it couldn't have been made twenty-five years ago , when paul newman hadn't yet handed over the iconic roles to actors ill-suited to handling them . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
director : mike judge . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual content ) running time : 88 minutes . freed of the " beavis and butt-head " -inspired hand-wringing by many conservative critics , judge has been able to show in " king of the hill " what his supporters have known all along : that judge observes behavioral quirks as well as anyone , whether his subjects are media-fried teenagers or middle-aged suburbanites . in office space , his first live-action feature , judge turns his attention to corporate culture , a world of cubicles , coffee and numbing sameness ripe for skewering . it's not a new target for judge . the first 45 minutes of office space exploit the concept to its fullest , resulting in some wonderfully surreal , wonderfully funny moments . gary cole , who so brilliantly nailed the mike brady cadence in the brady bunch films , is equally slick with the self-help tones of an inept middle-manager ( " if you could just remember to do that from now on , that would be great " ) . then , in a depressing turn of events , judge appears to run out of ideas for the premise he spent the first half of the film setting up . as even the characters in the film note , the premise is a rip-off from superman iii , and judge doesn't do anything interesting with it to justify recycling it . after a decent televison episode's worth of keen-edged satire , judge lets his script dribble into bland conventionality . it wouldn't be fair to suggest that judge is only comfortable with characters as cartoons -- hank hill is more endearingly human than most sit-com creations put together -- but that seems to be the case in office space . the robotic lumbergh and the muttering milton create the strongest impression in the film ; not coincidentally , they're the most extremely absurdist creations . he's much more effective pointing out the surreal yet all-too-real details of industrial park anthropology , but there's not quite enough material here to make it a thoroughgoing delight . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
producers : richard d . zanuck and lili fini zanuck and clint eastwood . director : clint eastwood . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 126 minutes . in robert altman's film industry satire the player , an earnest young screenwriter pitches a death penalty " issue " drama called habeas corpus , which he insists should have " no stars " and a downbeat ending , because " that's reality . " capital punishment had been reduced to a plot device for a by-the-numbers crowd-pleaser . in hollywood , _that's_ reality . on the surface , true crime appears to be something a bit more highbrow , but it's still a frustrating gloss over a sensitive subject . true crime is naturally more everett's story than anyone else's , which might lead you to expect that he's the character who will learn , grow and change , especially since he has enough character flaws to fill a week's worth of jerry springer episodes . instead , eastwood doesn't even pretend that everett's crusade is about anything more than salvaging a shred of his professional dignity . the role is surprisingly flat , leading to a narrative where all that matters is the plot progression towards beachum's midnight deadline . beachum's final hours with his wife and daughter are given a lot of screen time -- perhaps to deflect the perception that this is yet another movie about a white man finding salvation through helping anonymous non-white characters -- yet those scenes serve primarily to tangle the film's themes . if we're watching beachum's torment simply to give everett's story a face , it's a trivialization of that suffering . and if we're watching to build sympathy for an innocent man , than a late twist which suggests beachum might be guilty is a manipulative cheat . the film plunges us into one side of the capital punishment debate when it serves its purpose , then tiptoes around the edges of the issue at other times to avoid the appearance of making a controversial statement . ironically , it's only the fact that true crime is a slick hollywood star project that makes it fairly watchable . eastwood once again gathers wonderful technical support -- cinematographer jack n . green , composer lennie niehaus , production designer henry bumstead -- to create impressive atmosphere . he also draws a slick supporting performance from james woods' as everett's crass editor-in-chief , a role which makes you wonder whether woods and denis leary accidentally swapped scripts but the result turned out perfectly . the buildup to everett's down-to-the-wire race to find exonerating evidence will probably work on you in spite of your resistance , but ultimately it's clear that eastwood's craftsmanship is disguising a genuinely weightless story . true crime is true hollywood , a disposable entertainment that toys with earnest respectability before turning into a chase thriller where the traffic is a bitch . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : lowell ganz & babaloo mandell . director : ron howard . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 118 minutes . you'd think that the makers of edtv could take comfort in critic roger ebert's dictum that " a movie isn't about what it's about , it's _how_ it's about what it's about . " edtv , the filmmakers could argue , is about some of those same themes in a different way . sure , like the truman show it's about a man's life turned into 24-hour entertainment , but director ron howard could still make the claim that edtv is unique . and he'd be right , for all the worst possible reasons . edtv is a shallow and jokey rendering of its subject , a toothless satire that fades before the last punchline . hard to say , since we're not exactly to privvy to what ed's values were in the first place . the closest lowell ganz & babaloo mandel's script comes to defining ed is suggesting that he's basically a lazy simpleton who figures he can hit the big time by becoming a celebrity without doing any actual work . trouble is , that kind of personality wouldn't instantly endear ed either to his televsion audience or to us , so instead he's made a nice-guy rascal who scratches himself jes' like reg'lar folks . in short , he's a bore , as the subject of a television show and the subject of a feature film . even with a lackluster leading man , edtv might have worked if there had been any spark to its satire . how very bizarre to watch it instead morph into a kind of a meta-commentary on its own mass media sentibilities . as " edtv " becomes a phenomenon , we watch a parade of celebrities offer cameo commentary on ed-mania : ariana huffington , george plimpton , filmmaker michael moore , jay leno , bill maher , etc . edtv often aims to score points simply by trotting out famous faces , then finds no irony in a film about fame-for-fame's-sake which includes zingers from rupaul . even the endless series of advertisements on " edtv " feels more self-serving than sardonic ; aside from the clever use of a trojans ad during one of ed's romantic trysts , they feel like someone trying to have his product placement cake and eat it too . edtv still manages to be sporadically amusing , thanks largely to the gag-meister sit-com style of ganz and mandel . martin landau turns in a sharp supporting performance as ed's wheelchair-bound stepfather , and howard comes up with a couple of nicely-observed touches like the viewing parties that pop up around ed's first on-air sex . in general , though , ron howard is a sentimentalist with about as much edginess as a teletubbie . he's more interested in making edtv a fairly generic romanctic comedy than in digging into the reasons behind americans' video voyeurism , or examining how , in a post-modernist twist , our awareness of " reality " television has made reality just as staged as drama . in the end , edtv really is about the subject of mass media in its own way . it's about how much easier it is to let the viewers feel good than it is to tell them what they need to hear . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
10 things i hate about you ( touchstone ) starring : julia stiles , heath ledger , joseph gordon-levitt , larisa oleynik , david krumholtz , andrew keegan , larry miller . screenplay : karen mccullah lutz & kristen smith . director : gil junger . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity ) running time : 94 minutes . it seems like only a few weeks ago -- probably because it was -- that i was inveighing against the slew of " fill-in-the-blank , but with teenagers " movies . still they show no sign of abating , with a shudder-inducing sub-category creeping to the forefront : shakespeare , but with teenagers . by all rights it should have been as incredibly heinous as other recent juvenile jaunts , but it's actually kinda cute on occasion . though still too concerned with cozying up to its audience's sensibilities , 10 things at least offers a blueprint for how to make such material a bit more appealing . 10 things gets a leg up on most of its genre cousins simply by putting people on the screen who can act a lick . julia stiles is a charming , smart and fresh presence as kat , giving here attitude a little something more than _just_ attitude ; australian actor heath ledger makes for a nice foil with his combination of hulking presence and sensitivity ; and david krumholtz has a solid comic relief role as cameron's nerdy comrade . the adult roles are also satisfying for a change , primarily because they aren't used simply as walls off of which teens can bounce insults . i actually found myself chuckling at most of these characters instead of wishing desperately that they'd just go away . much of the credit for that should also go to writers karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith , who give the dialogue a bite that goes beyond insult humor and high school patois . some of the best lines are unprintable -- including patrick's curiosity over why bianca is so desirable -- but they all seem to have been given at least a little thought . while the situations are teen-film predictable -- a party scene , a prom scene , plenty of threats and posturing -- occasionally the writing emerges to deliver an unexpected laugh . it's not brilliant , but it's a sharp step up from stupid . as likeable as parts of 10 things aare , it's hard to get overly enthusiastic about it . veteran sit-com director gil junger , making his feature debut , slaps on a generous coat of sit-com glossiness , leaving little room for the truly acidic wordplay of a " taming of the shrew . " it's a warm and fuzzy sort of teen film with some welcome positive messages about independent thought and valuing depth of character , yet it still rarely rises above the level of the blandly generic . it might have had a chance if so many sub-plots hadn't been packed into a tight 94-minute package , short-changing them all with shallowness . still , it's enough of a surprise to find a teen film that doesn't overstay its welcome instantly , let alone deserves more fleshing out . it's enough to give you hope that there's actually a good movie to be made in 1999 " . . . with teenagers .

life is funny sometimes . . . just not as often as you might expect . universal is promoting life just the way you'd expect it to promote a film starring eddie murphy and martin lawrence -- as a raucous comedy with plenty of the insult humor , attitude and gay-baiting their target audience has come to expect . the funny thing is -- or isn't , as the case may be -- that life is actually an attempt by the two comedians to grow up a little . it's a commendable effort by two performers best known for more simple-minded material ; it's just not a very successful one . the pacing may be a bit pokey , but it still looks and smells like a mass-market comedy for a while . that's before screenwriters robert ramsey and matthew stone and director ted demme start taking some intriguing detours . as life unfolds , it starts to feel surprisingly ambitious , not at all like a whoop-it-up crowd-pleaser . as admirable as life's reach may be , however , it generally exceeds its grasp . while it lays out the sub-plots and advancing years like an epic in the making , the film-makers never appear entirely committed to making a film that could alienate many of the stars' core fans . life is a frustrating experience , because every time it appears close to making a connection to its characters it falls back on a lame joke to reassure the viewers that they're still watching a comedy . i may be kinder to life than it really deserves , simply because i was so surprised by its tone . martin lawrence , whose screen work has generally bordered on the insufferable , does some fairly nice work as the straight man in the duo , and murphy is in fine form as his quintessential fast talker . life is effective in bits and pieces , building on the predictable comedy in some unexpected ways . it just never builds on them in the necessary ways , never making the friendship between ray and claude its primary dramatic concern . it's a film caught between what the film-makers wanted to do and what the studio must have wanted them to do , just the clashing creation you'd expect from a story that's part stir crazy and part shawshank redemption . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
credit 20th century fox marketing with a first in my tenure as a critic : along with the press notes for pushing tin , they included a copy of the source material . it was a superb piece of reportage turned into a compelling story . there may be a great film to be made from that story , but pushing tin isn't it . for about the first half hour , and sporadically thereafter , pushing tin is actually about the high-pressure world of air traffic controllers . director mike newell employs computer graphics effectively to get us inside how controllers see their domain , and keeps up a brisk pace to match the frantic energy of the characters . meanwhile , writers glen & les charles ( co-creators of " cheers " ) do a nice job with the camaraderie and gallows humor that keeps everyone sane . in fact , just about everything is right with pushing tin except its central storyline . cusack and thornton are such talented actors that it might take longer than usual to register that their conflict has virtually nothing to do with the world of air traffic controllers . there was a mini-series' worth of psychological material in darcy frey's article , but pushing tin instead chooses the mundane head-butting of nick and russell , combined with smirky seductions and marital squabbles . it's a conflict that appears to have been pasted over this backdrop by people who had no idea what to do with it for a major studio film except tell a generic studio film story . there's no reason for pushing tin to be a film about rival air traffic controllers if this was the story they were going to tell ; it could just as easily be a film about rival matadors , or rival insurance salesmen , or rival periodontists . the lack of a solid center really shows in the final 45 minutes , when the film falls apart completely . there's a bumpy flight , a bomb scare , a zen immersion in a mountain stream and a showdown with jet engines , none of which makes the characters more than the broad sketches they've been from the start . that'll teach fox to give us a glimpse into what might have been . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
if i were writing a film project for myself , i can't say i wouldn't include a scene where i got to kiss sophie marceau . that's the thing about a commercial art form like film -- sometimes it's difficult to separate your emotions from your better judgment . david spade has proven himself extremely funny as a certain kind of character in a certain kind of context , and he's extremely funny again in lost & found when he decides to be that character in those contexts . leaving aside for a moment the improbable pairing of the elfin spade and the porcelain marceau , lost & found actually has a number of solid comic moments , assuming you're in tune with spade's routine . much of lost & found , however , suggests that he either doesn't know his own strengths or doesn't trust them to carry a film . in fact , spade and his co-writers often seem desperate to make viewers like the film by association with other films . the traumas to which dylan inadvertently subjects the dog evoke thoughts of there's something about mary , as does the musical closing credits sequence . spade never seems comfortable with dumbed-down material , but he's present for such comic delights as a foraging expedition through a mountain of dog droppings and a poker game with a quartet of elderly women who -- hilariously enough -- have dirty minds , dirty mouths and flatulence problems . when lost & found fumbles to connect with viewers through idiocy rather than spade's intelligence , it flounders . it also flounders when trying to make spade a romantic comedy protagonist . director jeff pollack tries hard to convince us that dylan can be a sensitive guy , but the attempts fall dreadfully flat . you just know that every time dylan has to make nice-nice with lila he'd rather be cutting loose with another put-down , which makes marceau's performance all the more impressive for making it seem remotely plausible that lila would fall for this guy . lost & found has its moments when david spade does what he does best , or when he brings on jon lovitz for a cameo as a " dog whisperer .

screenplay : david cronenberg . producers : robert lantos , andras hamori and david cronenberg . director : david cronenberg . mpaa rating : r ( violence , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 97 minutes . david cronenberg's existenz may be as thematically dense a film as we'll see all year . it touches on the nature of reality , and the ways we seek to escape it and embrace it at the same time . it addresses issues of violence in the media , as well as the nature of constructing a work of fiction . it's a cautionary tale , and a caution against excessive caution . it's a social satire , and even a self-satire . it's also , ultimately , a sinkhole for narrative and characterization . cronenberg has created an emotionally weightless intellectual exercise that's fun to parse but little fun to watch . if you know your cronenberg ( videodrome , the fly , crash ) at all , you know that you're entering a decidedly freaky realm . those same viewers may also find themselves wrapped up in deconstructing cronenberg's various messages . the design of the game pods -- which none-too-subtly resemble a compilation of erogenous zones -- turns into a poke at the masturbatory nature of video games , while allegra's writhing response to " plugging in " adds drug addiction to the metaphorical layering . the story treats us to characters who commit violence in the real world while thinking they're still in a game world -- a creepy , timely commentary on the influence of pop culture violence -- then takes a swipe at the actions of the neo-luddite anti-game faction . perhaps most amusingly , existenz plays with how characters behave in a fictional world , extending by implication to the plot-advancing conventions in film itself . there's enough sub-text in existenz to keep a viewer well-occupied for its 97 minutes . if only cronenberg had bothered to bring along any actual text to flesh out that subtext . existenz plays out like a scholarly analysis of itself , a cinematic cliff's notes for a novel that doesn't actually exist . leigh and law are as purely functional in their roles as their characters are in their game-roles , and while cronenberg may find that little meta-joke amusing , for a viewer it's merely distracting . by the time the plot of existenz starts folding in on itself ( leading to a revelation that's not at all revelatory if you've been paying attention ) , you may find yourself wondering why you should care about any of it . cronenberg is as stylistically distinctive a film-maker as we have in this cookie-cutter era , but he's locked himself into a rut of message-filled visions with no human connection . existenz plays out like a hallucinatory letter to the editor . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
i'll be honest with you : the last thing i was expecting from the paramount-distributed trekkies was a warts-n-all documentary about " star trek " fandom . roger nygard's trekkies , however , is about as far from an officially endorsed whitewash as one could imagine . in fact , though its character studies are at times undeniably amusing , it's almost too focused on turning its subjects into the oddballs everyone already suspects trekkies of being . the bad news for many " trek " fans expecting a sympathetic portrait is that those two characters are among the more mainstream folks in the film . when the subject matter swerves into the pornographic fan fiction which has been created using " trek " characters , it no longer feels like nygard is just creating a comprehensive catalog of the manifestations of trekkie-ism . there's an element of side show exploitation to these aspects of trekkies , a sense that nygard is less interested in understanding the phenomenon of trekkies than in turning their eccentricities into punch lines . that's truly a shame , because the " why's " of trekkies could have been at least as fascinating as the " who's " . in an utterly unique way , the universe created by gene roddenberry affected viewers as no other television program has in the history of the medium . trekkies also touches on the impact of the show's positive portrayal of multi-ethnic integration , and on the optimism of its messages of inclusion and acceptance . such ideas should have made it easier to see trekkies as social outsiders who have embraced a mythology in which they are tolerated , and even celebrated . it's ironic -- and somewhat disappointing -- to watch the film turn them into social outsiders once again . there's no denying that trekkies is occasionally quite funny , whether in the answers of cast members to the strangest fan experiences they have had , or in the ways various trekkies have integrated their love of " trek " into their lives ( like dentist dennis bourguignon's " starbase dental " office ) . it was only after i left the theater that i realized i had been laughing at these people more than i was laughing with them . yes , there are comments about how intelligent most " star trek " fans are ; it's too bad they feel like token gestures . many trekkies themselves seem to have embraced the film , but i'm not sure they should appreciate the way they are turned into exactly what the broader population generally thinks of them . there's not enough balance between the unusual things these people do and the love that inspires them to do those things . it was brave of paramount to endorse a film like trekkies . it also seems like a bit of a betrayal . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : george lucas . director : george lucas . mpaa rating : pg ( violence ) running time : 131 minutes . in one sense , of course , episode i - the phantom menace is the ultimate can't-lose proposition . it's also the ultimate can't-win proposition , a monolith nearly impossible to separate from the ridiculous expectations . curiously , critics face a similar predicament . a rave could be interpreted as succumbing to the hype , while a jeer could be viewed as anti-hype backlash . how do you talk about a film that virtually demands the creation of a new set of rules -- for the film-maker , for the media , for the audience ? and transported i was . . . into a hard drive . there are plenty of other plot fragments floating around in the phantom menace -- most of them involving political machinations -- but the ho-hum plotting may actually be the least of its flaws . quite simply , this is a film devoid of personality , filled with characters who never inspire affection or close identification . star wars , for all its dazzle , had three fundamentally solid characters at its core : conflicted hero-on-a-quest luke ; tough , no-nonsense leia ; and lovable rogue han . it's almost funny to hear qui-gon described as rebellious , since he seems about as capable of a rash act as he is of cracking a smile . there may be heroes in the phantom menace , but there's really no one to like . and , for that matter , there's really no one to hate . darth sidious , the sith who will be emperor , is the primary villain of the piece , yet he only appears in the form of a jittery transmission , hardly the stuff of genuine menace . darth maul , meanwhile -- he of the marketing-friendly day-glo visage -- is effective considering his limited screen time , yet he's really a glorified henchman for all his double-bladed lightsaber tricks . the phantom menace is missing that unifying , ultimately hissable bad guy that makes for great archetypal conflict . what we do have is a triumph of art direction and technology which creates alien worlds like no film ever has before . though the pacing of the opening hour is on the pokey side -- which places it in good company with the first star wars -- lucas eventually produces a few dynamic set pieces like the desert pod race . when the phantom menace goes for pure visual satisfaction , it usually delivers . ultimately , though , there's a more basic satisfaction the film lacks . its structure and imagery are reminiscent both of star wars and return of the jedi -- particularly the latter in its three-ring climax -- but it doesn't even achieve jedi's level of old-fashioned fantasy fulfillment . when gungans and battle droids clash on the fields of naboo , every last figure a digital concoction , you begin to sense the absence of a primally appealing human story in this blockbuster . for now , all that remains is spectacle without resonance , without magic , without even all that much fun if you happen to be over the age of 10 . the result is an adventure that feels . . . well , see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : mike myers & michael mccullers . director : jay roach . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , adult humor ) running time : 95 minutes . first , this must be said : i was wrong about the original austin powers : international man of mystery . in 1997 , i gave the film an unenthusiastic , noting that writer/star mike myers' infatuation with old " saturday night live " sketches and characters blunted the truly inspired comic moments . i'm still pretty comfortable with my rating , though a recent second viewing suggested i may have been slightly stingy ( dr . evil alone is too hilarious not to warrant at least a mild recommendation ) . no , i was wrong in a suggestion i made for improvement . austin powers : the spy who shagged me proves that a different temporal setting wouldn't have changed anything , because myers used a different temporal setting and _didn't_ change anything . faster than you can say basil exposition ( michael york ) , austin has a time machine of his own , and pops back to swinging london . the exact nature of that something evil is , of course , entirely beside the point . the spy who shagged me is at its goofy best when it's most self-aware , mocking film conventions of all sorts . when myers finds a comic target -- starbucks , the music of the 80s , star wars' opening narrative crawl -- he knows how to use it . the original austin powers was at its most wearying when myers took a joke and beat all semblance of life out of it for several agonizing minutes . he's at it again this time , and he's using identical gags he already exhausted in the previous film . even the original's best sequence -- the evil family therapy session -- is revisited as a " jerry springer " episode . and when myers does come up with a new concept , he still insists on using it twice , or twice as long as necessary . we've all come to expect sequels that recycle huge chunks of the original , usually in the action genre . when a satirical comedy loses its sense of discovery , there's not much reason for it to exist . the one major change is the 1969 setting , though there doesn't seem to be much point to it . mostly , it's a lot more of the same . that's a bad thing when we're talking about making the same mistakes twice . austin powers fans will surely be ready to forgive myers' lapses in imagination . others will be left trying to figure out where this promising series could actually reach its potential . maybe the 1950s next time ? see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : s . s . wilson & brent maddock and jeffrey price & peter s . seaman . director : barry sonnenfeld . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , violence , adult humor , profanity ) running time : 105 minutes . you can poke fun , which worked well with the brady bunch films . you can play it straight , which worked well with the untouchables . or you can pump it up with cinematic steroids , which has crashed and burned the avengers , the mod squad , lost in space , my favorite martian , etc . in their zeal to dust off beloved small screen properties for the big screen , producers often have ignored everything that made those properties beloved in the first place . the nostalgia card only plays so far , after all -- if you want to bring in the kids , you've got to blow more stuff up . there was every reason to suspect that wild wild west would be the latest t . v . charmer-turned-blockbuster monstrosity . producer jon peters was renowned for embracing the " too much isn't nearly enough " ethos , and word of disastrous test screenings had been leaking out of hollywood for a few months . as it turns out , wild wild west is only part monstrosity and part faithful re-creation , with neither approach working nearly as well as it should . there are at least a few hints that director barry sonnenfeld is interested in evoking tongue-in-cheek spirit of the series . the film also hooks in to the series' anachronistic satire of james bond-like secret agent hijinks , which turns into a surprising problem . in 1965 , it was fresh to watch artemus play fussy q to west's brawling bond , fresh to watch an adventure self-aware of adventure genre conventions . in 1999 , hip referentiality just isn't hip any more , especially when it comes to manly action heroes and their toys . west , " it should play as a winking homage . instead , it just feels tired . when wild wild west doesn't work as a straight return to the gimmicks and goofs of the series , there's always the bombastic special effects route . gadgetry and megalomania were common elements of the series , but a computer-rendered 80-foot-tall mechanized tarantula-tank doesn't have quite the same low-tech appeal . the overkill isn't even restricted to the special effects , with salma hayek's va-va-voom appeal wasted for no other reason than a little bare flesh . and when the script is in need of an easy joke , there's always smith knowingly fending off southern racism . branagh seems to understand the theatrical hamminess required for loveless , pitching the character as cartoonish as he can be . wild wild west is so frantic that it spends too little time on its strongest asset , the interplay between smith and kline . both actors have fine comic timing , and both play up the rivalry between the gunslinger and the deep thinker . there are more enjoyable comic moments in wild wild west than i was expecting , thanks to sonnenfeld's sometimes surreal comic touch ( references to e . t . and the rca victor dog ) . he just bounces back and forth too often between approaches to the material . it's uneven as throwback entertainment , and it's uneven as contemporary action film -- a wild wild mess of a movie that shows the danger of playing around with previously successful material , no matter how you try to play it . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : adam herz . director : paul weitz . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , profanity , nudity , adult themes ) running time : 96 minutes . ah , for those carefree days when a sniggering teen sex comedy could be a sniggering teen sex comedy . the time was the early 80s , when films like porky's , losin' it and the last american virgin celebrated the adolescent male in all his sex-obsessed glory . that was pre-aids , when no one thought twice about mining the blinding surge of hormones for all the low-brow humor it was worth . in 1999 , apparently , you need to be more socially responsible in your portrayals of high school horn-dogs . leering and debauchery are permitted only if you note the foolishness of leering and debauchery . it's that one hypocritical miscalculation that spoils much of the puerile fun of american pie . jim ( jason biggs ) , utterly inept in his sexual explorations , finds himself sharing intimate moments with his dad ( a brilliantly cast eugene levy ) more often than any girl . naturally , all of their tentative fumblings lead to humiliating , disgusting -- and sometimes very funny -- situations . the belly laughs are crude and far between , interrupted too often by the bland romance between oz and heather , but the outrageous situations and appealing cast maintain a high energy level . as unapologetic raunchiness , it's fairly effective . as the film draws to a close , jim lets loose with a speech about how tired he is of the emphasis on sex , which " isn't really that important . " it's a jaw-dropping display of chutzpah from a film that has just spent 90 minutes yanking laughs from its audience with the idea that sex isn't everything , it's the only thing . it's enough to make you gag on your laxative-laced mochachino . there is a place , of course , for films that cast a more thoughtful , skeptical eye on the caprices of youthful sexuality . those films may be even more necessary now than ever . american pie , however , shouldn't have tried to be one of them , because there's also a place for a throwback to a time when you weren't expected to feel guity about your guffaws . if you're going to be naughty , at least have the nerve to stand by your naughtiness when it's funny . herz and weitz want to have their american pie and eat it too . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : duncan kennedy and donna powers & wayne powers . director : renny harlin . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 105 minutes . steven spielberg has said for years that one of the keys to the success of jaws was technical failure . the mechanical shark affectionately nicknamed " bruce " wasn't necessarily supposed to be a shadowy figure menacing the protagonists from the fringes of the frame -- he just didn't work right . bruce's frequent unannounced work stoppages forced spielberg to get more creative . the rest is a milestone in cinematic suspense history , further proof that real terror comes not from what we see , but from what we're afraid we're going to see . it would be easy enough to scoff at deep blue sea as a gloss on jaws that just doesn't " get it , " but that wouldn't be entirely fair . jaws , whether intentionally or made necessary by technical limitations , was a suspense film ; deep blue sea is an old-fashioned monster movie . the genre conventions are all terribly conventional , but director renny harlin stages them with methodical effectiveness . there are a few solid scares and one magnificently effective shock , the kind that leaves an audience giggling nervously for several seconds . there's even some cautionary nonsense about scientific hubris , in the fine tradition of frankenstein or the fly . it's what monster movies are supposed to do , and deep blue sea uses its trio of toothy villains to deliver the requisite armrest-gripping . if only anyone involved with the script had taken a second to go beyond the merely requisite . deep blue sea is full of half-completed characters doing generally stupid things . granted , the monster movie as we know it would not exist without people doing generally stupid things , but it's still frustrating to put up with them saying stupid things at the same time . the film gets even sloppier by positing not merely that the sharks have developed advanced intelligence , but that they have apparently studied physics and engineering , and had access to detailed schematic diagrams of the facility . there's only so far a film can involve you when it treats the viewers as though they're dumb and treats the characters as though they're chum . deep blue sea is , of course , following in some mighty big footsteps in the killer shark milieu , which makes it even more surprising that there are so many echoes of jaws and its sequels . it's almost as though harlin and company _want_ the film to be compared to jaws , as though they think they've one-upped the ultimate shark film . in the press notes , harlin says of jaws , " it's 25 years later , and audiences , accustomed to animatronics and computer-generated imagery , need to see more . " and perhaps he's right , but that still only makes deep blue sea a technically-proficient monster movie . as character-driven suspense , it bites off much more than it can chew . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
there are plenty of strange , ironic and otherwise inexplicable things about hollywood filmmaking in the 1990s , but among the more puzzling is the way it treats " star power . " in the glory days of the studio system , hollywood packaged stars together in whatever material was available at the time , always conscious of the fact that audiences would come out to see certain actors do little more than model wardrobe . plenty of films exist primarily to be glossy star packages , but the studios treat that fact as a dirty little secret . in these post-modern , indie-hip cinematic times of ours , it has become unfashionable to admit that sometimes we just like to see attractive people doing attractive things . that's the only explanation for the thomas crown affair , a star package so overwhelmingly glossy you may need to shield your eyes from the glare . the thomas crown affair follows in the fine tradition of the original 1968 version , which itself existed largely as a star vehicle for steve mcqueen and faye dunaway . the scenery , from the nightspots of the manhattan jet set to the tropical islands to which that set jets , is lovingly photographed . director john mctiernan steps back from die hard-style pacing to establish a moderate , almost jazzy tempo for the too-cool characters and situations . brosnan , who probably emerged from the womb in a freshly pressed tuxedo , squints in a manly fashion ; russo , attempting to do for women's underwear what clark gable did for t-shirts , does the little black dress thing with slinky appeal . teflon should only be this slick . plenty of viewers will undoubtedly find themselves carried away by this fantasia for beautiful people . i might even have been among them if the thomas crown affair hadn't grown so angst-y and redundant . it's an early signal that the film is going to play the " sure , they're beautiful people , but they've got feelings too " card . it's entertaining enough to watch as crown and banning circle each other , each one thinking he or she is the manipulator rather than the manipulatee . russo plays the final half hour with such overwrought gravity that you'd think her decision whether or not to turn crown in made her hamlet to his polonius . i find myself in an awkward position as i criticize the thomas crown affair , because ultimately i fault it for trying to work in some subtext . plenty of films could use a healthy injection of subtext , mind you -- or the vaugest hint of a text , even -- but this film isn't one of them . it fairly screams out to be treated as a caper , with crown and banning spending their time trying to out-think each other rather than out-emote each other . there's just too much earnestness to the way they play it . by trying to play a 1940s story with 1990s emotional realism , the filmmakers miss the fantasy we're looking for when we watch two movie stars together in a movie that , ultimately , is about two movie stars together . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
albert brooks has always been a filmmaker who couldn't resist a great high concept . an inspired , outrageous situation has provided brooks with the spark to show his characters -- notably himself -- coming to terms with themselves and finding a little dignity . his concepts fueled the gags , but he never forgot to tell a story . the muse seems to have been born as yet another hollywood satire , poking fun at the insecurities of movie folk and ther fascination with the latest insta-cure for what ails them personally or professionally . the insider gags , unfortunately , are about the only ones that work . more often , the muse is a comedy in search of something , _anything_ funny to say . sharon stone's finicky diva is an idea that never quite takes off , and the supporting players often look vaguely bored with their lines . even brooks' usually reliable persona can't jump-start the film , because it doesn't turn into a sympathetic character . he's just an annoyed privileged guy whose annoyance at his slightly lessened privilege makes him just plain annoying . brooks' lack of a character is part of the over-riding problem with the muse : a lack of anything substantial past the thin premise . the film occasionally looks like it could be leading stephen towards a little growing up , whether about his career neuroses or his retro-breadwinner agitation at laura's growing financial success as a cookie-maker . there's even the faint hope that brooks could be offering a light-hearted look at the shove people require just to believe in their own talents . then the film ends , and it becomes evident that there's not a shred of actual story to the muse . there's no improved mutual understanding in the phillips' relationship , no one grows , no one learns a thing -- there's not even the satisfaction of sarah explaining her own turns of character . the whole thing just fades to black , leaving a shallow collection of industry jokes in its wake . there are a few decent laughs to be found in brooks' validation of william goldman's line about how " nobody knows anything " in hollywood . mark feuerstein has a nicely understated role as a tactless studio executive , and steven wright appears briefly as the nepotistically- advantaged stan spielberg . but much of the acidic humor leaves a sour aftertaste once it's clear that it's all little more than a chance for brooks to vent . his character spends much of the film in search of a third act for his screenplay , which is ironic when you consider that the muse is in desperate need of a third act of its own . it's even more ironic that in the middle of a hollywood satire , the protagonist's brilliant script -- the one he's inspired to write after being told he has " lost [his] edge " -- is a wacky high-concept vehicle for jim carrey . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
in this summer of uniquely adult suspense fare like the blair witch project and the sixth sense , the astronaut's wife initially seems like a promising companion piece . there's certainly an aura of familiarity to the story , but that almost seems to work for the build-up of suspense . everything about the astronaut's wife aims for an ever-growing sense of menace -- ravich's odd camera angles , time-lapses and slow motions ; cinematographer allen daviau's murky photography ; production designer jan roelfs' sterile interiors . technically , there's a lot to like about the astronaut's wife and the way it keeps a viewer unsteady and uneasy . as a narrative however , nearly everything seems just ever-so-slightly off . the film feels like it starts too late , eventually revealing crucial pieces of armacost family history that really should have been shown to us . individual scenes flow smoothly , but the transitions between them are awkward and abrupt . characters who seem like they should play a much more significant role flit in and out of the story inconsistently . ravich doesn't seem entirely in control of the pace , letting the film ooze along eerily without ever knowing where to crank it up or tone it down . the familiar " devil inside " plot elements are played deadly straight , creating the impression that ravich is taking his story far too seriously . even the key moments of exposition drift by so deliberately they're gone before you have a chance to register that they might be important . the astronaut's wife spends 106 minutes convincing you that it's just about to turn into something compelling , then never does . the performances and characters are certainly a significant part of the problem . like the rest of the story , the characters feel incomplete . depp plays the post-close encounter spencer with a disquieting flatness , but we see too little of spencer the good guy to make the transition unsettling . theron has already proven in the devil's advocate that she knows how to play frantic and tormented , but again there's a back-story missing from her performance ( though it's dropped into the dialogue ) . ravich keeps building the astronaut's wife as though the plight of the characters is going to elevate the genre story , when ultimately the characters don't mean a thing . i must admit that i was startled to find the astronaut's wife remotely watchable when it appeared without preview screenings . the look of the film is nearly enough , combined with theron's haunted stares , to make it linger in your head for a while . it just doesn't deliver on the most basic level , leaving you itchy and unsatisfied as though you had just watched a film that wasn't quite finished yet . there are too many other , better choices for viewers who want a little substance with their chills . after you get through admiring the style of the astronaut's wife , all you're left with is a lot of empty space . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
director : michael corrente . miramax bows to no one when it comes to marketing films , but with outside providence , they've crossed the line . they're touting the film as " the new comedy from the guys who made there's something about mary , " which is deceptive for two reasons . second , outside providence is about as much like there's something about mary as there's something about mary is like the big chill . a raucous , outrageous farrelly brothers comedy it is not , despite the three-legged dog prominently displayed in all the ad copy . to cut miramax some slack , i'm not sure what they should have done to market this film . every so often , outside providence shows flashes of the twisted sensibility the farrelly brothers have come to represent . such moments are rare , however , generally taking a back seat to romantic montages , gruff family bonding , and more dope-filled scenes than we've seen since the glory days of cheech & chong . it's not the fault of corrente or the farrellys that miramax is promising something outside providence isn't . it is their fault that it's hard to enjoy what outside providence is . this episodic coming-of-age tale has no focus , no rhythm , and no strong sense of its characters . most of the scenes at cornwall are strangely inert , rarely exploiting the fish-out-of-water concept of a blue collar amidst starched collars except for a single lame prank . outside providence does have a certain gritty appeal as an off-beat family dramedy . hatosy's performance is solid , as is baldwin's atypical work as an unconventional father . it's just a film that's always casting around for its center , offering sporadic entertainment that doesn't stick to you . it's not quite funny enough for a comedy , not quite insightful enough for a story of adolescent awakening , and not quite emotional enough for a story of family ties . that's a hard sell for any marketing department , enough to send you fishing for comparisons to a movie that exists in an entirely different universe . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : lawrence kasdan . producers : charles okun and lawrence kasdan . director : lawrence kasdan . mpaa rating : r ( adult themes , drug use , profanity , nudity , sexual situations ) running time : 111 minutes . lawrence kasdan has grown to adore narrative sprawl . he attracted wonderful actors because he wrote wonderful parts , but he seemed little interested in making those parts part of a whole . sometimes ( the big chill , silverado , grand canyon ) those untamed scripts still turned into satisfying episodic films ; sometimes ( the accidental tourist , wyatt earp ) they turned into meandering acting showcases . mumford , kasdan's latest exercise in free-form ensemble , has the germ of a great story at the core of his narrative . . . and he promptly drowns that germ in the pencillin of his herky-jerky directing . though his therapy brings results , his credentials aren't exactly conventional either . it takes a while before kasdan spills all the beans about doc mumford's back story , but by then you can already see everything that's right and everything that's wrong about mumford . on the plus side -- predictably for a kasdan film -- is the cast , filled with appealing character performers . loren dean's low-key , natural delivery is perfect for the no-nonsense doc mumford , jason lee shows a sweetness far more convincing than it was in kissing a fool , and the radiant hope davis lends her unique gifts to sofie , the chronically fatigued patient for whom doc mumford falls . kasdan drops these characters into the kind of bucolic , milkman-served town that would appeal to anyone looking for a fresh start . it's the ideal set-up for a comic romance with complications . but mumford isn't a comic romance with complications , at least not often enough . though the actors are all fine , their characters are a huge distraction . kasdan certainly needs to show doc mumford's gift for helping people , but he includes far too many such scenes . in the process , he loses track of mumford's backbone , creating a film that bumps along with virtually no flow . that lack of momentum is most evident when it becomes clear that mumford's payoff will be a relationship between mumford and sofie . there are a couple of perfectly charming scenes between dean and davis , but there's no way to anticipate that the film is leading up to a choice based on those scenes . mumford more often plays as a subtle jab at therapy , suggesting that a really good listener who knows something about overcoming troubles is all an unhappy soul really needs . that's an interesting enough concept , but it doesn't exactly make for a satisfying story ; watching doc mumford's patient list hijack the film only emphasizes that mumford should have been about the doctor . the saying goes that there are no small parts , only small actors . lawrence kasdan seems to agree . . . to a fault . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
director : ang lee . while watching the wedding banquet ( currently in limited release ) , i found myself thinking that it would have a very good short . this taiwanese-american comedy about generational and cultural conflict has fifty minutes of genuine energy stretched into an hour and fifty minute film . there are moments of real charm and insight , but ultimately the sluggish pace doesn't hold them together . ma and pa gao get a wedding , wei-wei gets a green card , and wei-tung gets a welcome tax write-off . complications . there are several thematic threads in the wedding banquet , all with interesting possibilities . foremost , there is the issue of living up to parental expectations which have nothing to do with who you are as a person . this latter area receives the most attention , but like the others it is given somewhat short shrift . director and co-scripter ang lee seems to want his film to be about too many different things , without giving sufficient attention to any of them . there are , as i've noted , some very clever set pieces . these individual moments almost add up , but they don't quite . much of the responsibility for this lack of engagement falls on the shoulders of the two male leads . chao , a first time actor , never invests wei-tung with any real depth . lichtenstein too is far too wooden , making simon's genuine frustration over having to hide himself come off as simple petulance . fortunately , there are good performances to somewhat balance theirs , most notably lung , who does some wonderful physical acting , and may lin , who sparkles as wei-wei . unfortunately , her character is sadly underwritten , as are most of the roles . the lulls in the pace would have been acceptable had strong characters been present to pull me along , but i was simply never caught up enough in their lives . it's difficult not to recommend the wedding banquet , since it's heart seems so firmly in the right place . it has its moments , and the themes of familial conflict may strike a chord with many viewers . however , i just never found myself caring quite enough , and i found myself looking at my watch too frequently . 
screenplay : kurt luedtke , from darryl ponsican's adaptation of the novel by warren adler . director : sydney pollack . mpaa rating : r ( adult themes , profanity , sexual situations ) running time : 131 minutes . for a romantic drama , random hearts sure doesn't begin the way you would expect . the pacing may be slow , but the set-up is engrossing and effective . to understand what's so dreadful about the romantic story in random hearts , you have to understand the laughter . and the audience starts howling . you could argue that they were responding to the awkwardness of the moment , but i'm not sure i'd buy it . in a matter of seconds , it was obvious that people weren't buying that relationship . doomed romanced between wounded , grieving souls are nothing new in dramatic cinema -- case in point : last tango in paris -- but such films generally focus on the essential emptiness at the center of the relationship . random hearts has too old-time-hollywood a sensibility to delve into that kind of psychological pain . scenes between dutch and kay keep suggesting the potential for genuine affection between them , something besides the mutual despair and betrayal that connected them in the first place . when harrison ford -- looking a bit silly in his stud earring -- says to her , " i was thinking about your mouth , " you have to believe kay would have laughed in his face . of course people in hollywood love stories are always saying ridiculously purple things to one another , and audiences roll with it all the time . it can only work , however , if the story is builty on one of those sweeping archetypal premises in which soulmates are inspired to rhapsodic poetry . random hearts shouldn't have had the faintest whiff of soulmates to it , not when the hook is the visceral response of two people to an affair between their spouses . pollack is too polished and professional a film-maker to produce an unwatchable product ; he's also too polished and professional a film-maker to delve into those dark places where the film needed to live . by the time the smiling , optimistic denouement rolls around , you know the audience was right when their gut response to this relationship was to laugh out loud . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
director : wes craven . mpaa rating : pg ( mild profanity , adult themes ) running time : 118 minutes . it was a heartfelt appeal , and i was surprised to find the film evoking a heartfelt response . i responded passionately to the narrow-minded administrative mandates that , in times of budgetary constraint , describe the arts and music in public schools as " extra , " or not part of a " core curriculum . " and my heart was lightened at the sights and sounds of children making beautiful music . i'll willingly make the following admission , gentle readers : i found myself getting misty-eyed during music of the heart . i follow this admission with one of a different sort , the sort that makes viewers everywhere want to throttle critics within an inch of their thumb-turning , star-distributing lives : music of the heart , moving though it may be , just isn't a particularly good film . then those nasty budget cuts begin rearing their ugly head , forcing roberta to find creative funding solutions . there's no denying the fundamental emotional appeal of a story like this one . hollywood has always loved " inspirational teacher " films , and there have been plenty of them : the miracle worker ; to sir , with love ; conrack ; dead poets society ; stand and deliver ; lean on me ; mr . holland's opus ; dangerous minds ; etc . in recent years they have become even more prevalent -- perhaps indicative of how much more complicated teaching has become -- as well as more rigidly formulaic . the ultimate disappointment of music of the heart has little to do with its predictability ; on the contrary , like many films of its kind it hits its emotional high notes even though you know exactly where they're going to come . no , the disappointment in music of the heart comes from a strangely fragmented narrative that never quite commits to a central story . the film occasionally explores the juxtaposition of guaspari's background and that of her students , but the intrusions of social problems in the kids' lives are lurching and token pieces of " reality " -- a child of separated parents here , a victim of a drive-by shooting there , an instance of domestic abuse thrown in for good measure . when the story starts winding its way into guaspari's experiment with blind dating , you have to wonder if director wes craven has any sense for its focus . there's no question it was a pivotal moment in the history of guaspari's program , nor is there any question the carnegie hall benefit concert -- featuring big name performers like isaac stern , itzhak perlman and arnold steinhardt -- makes for a rousing finish . it just doesn't feel like part of the same film . stand and deliver reached its natural conclusion with the first successful ap exam ; music of the heart tags on a 45-minute coda after guaspari's first successful concert . of course there are several touching moments in that final 45 minutes , and throughout the film . unfortunately , however , it's the ideas alone that are touching , not the way the film presents them . it's easy to be moved by the sentiments expressed in streep and estefan's introductory clip . it's harder to be moved by a story that lets the mere concept of an " inspirational teacher " film do all the work . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
i have a confession to make which may compromise my integrity as a reviewer ( if that isn't an oxymoron ) : i wanted the good son to be horrible . * really * horrible . i've grown so tired of macaulay culkin's yelping mug and the highly-publicized power grabs by his manager-dad , that i wanted him to be wholly responsible for a colossal failure . well , the good son isn't horrible ; it's merely mediocre , which may be worse . at least a truly awful thriller can provoke campy laughs . all the good son provoked in me was boredom . i had very little problem with the basic premises of the good son . the problems with the good son are almost entirely in the execution . the film waits far too long , nearly a third of its running time , before introducing us to henry , setting up mark's guilt and showing off desert scenery . there's no time for the menace to build slowly , or for the early pranks to be tame enough so that mark could get a bit caught up in them himself . ian mcewan's script seemed to need another draft and earlier plot points . the performances are also a big problem . elijah wood is fine , a good young actor forced to spend most of this film making his eyes as wide as possible . his relatives , however , don't fare as well . we're never specifically told how long it has been since the death of the other son , and that would have helped . as it is , wallace seems perfectly recovered , while susan appears simply melancholy , striking bronte-esque poses on a seaside promontory . this is also parly the fault of a performance by culkin lacking in subtlety . instead of the straightforward tone of a true sociopath , culkin adopts the wide-eyed , solemn , sing-song style any parent would instantly recognize as a child lying . it's homicidal that he hasn't quite mastered . if there's one surprising culprit in the good son's failings , it's director joseph ruben . but the good son goes everywhere you expect it to go , exactly when you expect it . it's a competent but cut-and-paste directing job , providing the minimum recommended allowance of suspense . i never groaned out loud , but i never felt any real tension , either . the good son is not a complete failure . it's the kind of thriller where you might jump once , then wonder why you fell for * that * old bit . and as reluctant as i am to admit it , culkin shows that he might be more than a one-trick pony given a little seasoning . it just might be a good idea if his next trick is something original . 
screenplay : alvin sargent , based on the novel by mona simpson . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity ) running time : 114 minutes . for a long time during anywhere but here , my attention was fixed somewhere i didn't quite expect . relationship dramas like this tend to be all about character and performance -- every scene is an actor's scene , every moment is an actor's moment . but to my surprise , i became fascinated with the way the film looked . the grainy film stock renders everything slightly fuzzy ; the bleached colors suck the golden glow out of tinseltown . i mean no disrespect to mr . deakins or to the craft of cinematography when i say that , even at the time , i knew anywhere but here couldn't have been working the way it was supposed to if i was paying attention to the choice of film stock . it's been done before , of course -- even the kooky mother and more stable daughter has been done before , in films like mermaids -- but solid writing and strong performances can often counteract familiarity . anywhere but here does come through with the strong performances . their scenes together effectively capture the perpetual tension between ann and adele , and do a particularly nice job of showing ann's frustration at being the real grown-up of the two while never turning her into a wise-ass . and that may be why anywhere but here feels so claustrophobic and artificial . we see ann walking uncomfortably through beverly hills high on her first day of school , but there's no sense of her struggle before she's giggling away with girlfriends ; a few scattered scenes of adele in her job as a speech pathologist/therapist provides no sense for why this flighty woman ever got into a field that demands so much patience . most disappointing , there's far too little background on their lives in wisconsin for us to understand why adele wants to leave and ann wants to stay , and far too little development of the potentially intriguing relationship between ann and her almost-kissing-cousin benny ( shawn hatosy ) . there's really not a single strong supporting character anywhere but here can bounce off of . it's no wonder these two drive each other crazy -- they've been hermetically sealed away from the rest of the world . one could argue that such an isolated , in-each-other's-face relationship is precisely the point of anywhere but here -- that ann and adele have nothing in the world but each other , crazy-making as they may be to each other . that doesn't make it any easier to spend two hours with them -- and only them -- and their conflicts , well-acted though they may be . and of course there was the cinematography , which -- while thematically appropriate -- also reminded me what anywhere but here was missing . this is a drama too lacking in background color . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : neal purvis & robert wade and bruce feirstein . director : michael apted . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , adult themes ) running time : 128 minutes . after 40 years and 19 films , the james bond series is a cinematic institution -- perhaps even the last cinematic institution . in a film industry climate where the object of big-budget movies is generally to show the audience something new and dazzling , the bond series is all about structural stability . you know you'll get a show-stopping stunt sequence to kick things off . you know that stunt sequence will lead into opening credits filled with writhing female silhouettes . you know bond will fire off a few ghastly puns aimed at q's latest gadgets . you attend because there's something comforting about knowing it will taste the same every time . it's a recipe you don't want to see shaken or stirred . in a sense , there's little to say about the world is not enough that hasn't already been said about the 18 installments that have preceded it . it similarly goes without saying that there's a villain bent on mass destruction . it does bear mentioning that the world is not enough turns out to be a frustrating combination of the all-too-common and the distractingly absent . the film does open with a rousing pre-credits chase sequence involving motorboats racing down the thames . when bond leaps from a boat sailing through the air , catching the dangling rope on a hot air balloon in the process , there's hope that director michael apted can maintain that sort of high-flying absurdity . how many times can we thrill to bond fleeing gunmen while skiing ? how many times can a shootout in a place where every inanimate object explodes be interesting ? how many times can you wring excitement from getting caught underwater without air ? far more often , the perfunctory thrice-hourly action sequences are just there to remind you that you're watching a bond film . sometimes the reminder is necessary , because the world is not enough is otherwise short on traditional bond texture . the film may trot out locations in spain , kazakhstan , azerbaijan and turkey , but it never does anything with them , denying us the welcome pleasure of bond film as exotic travelogue . most disappointing of all is renard , who may be the least commanding villain the series has ever seen . it's bad enough that he gets only a few scenes to develop any kind of personality ; it's inexcusable that he turns out to be a self-pitying lap dog for the real villain pulling the strings . mix in the absence of a suitably unstoppable nasty henchman ( are the oddjobs and jaws's of the post-cold war world so hard to come by ? ) , and you've got a pretty vanilla thrilla . it is enjoyable to watch pierce brosnan growing into the role of bond so comfortably . connery enthusiasts may cringe , but i believe brosnan is the best all-around bond yet -- no one else has combined such convincing licensed-to-kill menace with a bon vivant twinkle in the eye . but when the best thing about a bond film is the acting , you know something isn't right . perhaps i've reached a point in my movie-going life where a bond film is a no-win proposition . the world is not enough -- not enough creativity , and not enough welcome nostalgia value . even for fast food , the familiar tastes too familiar , and the unfamiliar just tastes wrong . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : angelo pizzo . director : david anspaugh . here's where i get to come off like the callous , cold-hearted critic that i am . rudy is uplifting ; rudy is inspirational . it's feel-good hollywood entertainment in all its glory . it's also just not all that interesting . rudy is too diffuse , takes too long to get where it's going , and skimps on what should be its climax . rudy's primary structural flaw is that its script tries to cover too much time and too many different ( and tangential ) aspects of rudy ruettiger's story . however , i was most frustrated by what seemed to be an indecision on the part of screenwriter angelo pizzo and director david anspaugh as to where the triumph in rudy's story lies . a series of individual victories begins with rudy's inevitable acceptance to notre dame , each of which could have been a testimony to an indomitable spirit . i was glad for fortune's lecture regarding why rudy should consider himself a success , but by the end i had lost some necessary sympathy for rudy . he's quite good at bringing across rudy's earnest determination , and looks the perfect part with his solid but undersized body . unfortunately , i don't think the script gives him a firm enough grasp of rudy's character . the brief sequence showing rudy as a child doesn't do it , nor do the confrontations with his family which seem intended to do so . indeed , most of the characters suffer from such an overly broad stroke . prosky gets a couple of nice scenes , but there's not much freshness to his character either . this is a script with too many lines like , " if i don't do this now , i won't be any good for you , or me , or anyone , " and , " not a day goes by that i don't regret it . " it's the " one from column a , one from column b " school of sports film screenwriting . to its credit , rudy does a great job with the atmosphere of notre dame and notre dame football ; in fact , the south bend campus becomes a character more carefully developed than most of the humans . however , with such effective buildup , i was disappointed with the handling of the final game sequence . things happened far too fast , and an important shot involving rudy's last play is just badly directed . it's too bad . rudy has a great deal of energy and an interesting , improbably heroic story to tell . it's a moderately entertaining film , with a message and content appropriate for the whole family . what it lacks is focus . 
the collaboration of these two individuals , along with one of the fall's most compelling trailers , gave me high hopes for fearless . it only delivered halfway . fearless contains a handful of gripping moments and one outstanding performance by bridges , but it also has some hollow interpersonal moments and a lack of focus that holds it back from real greatness . indeed , fearless maintains an intense , hypnotic energy for the first fifteen minutes , as max's odd new persona takes hold . then , rather abruptly and much to the worse , it shifts gears into fairly run-of-the-mill family drama . this tangent of the story doesn't work for two basic reasons . one , laura isn't all that interesting , and rossellini doesn't succeed in projecting any warmth or concern . second , max is such a jerk that i felt everyone would have been better off if he had just left . screenwriter rafael yglesias , adapting his novel , doesn't have the guts to really attack max's arrogance , and weir lets his christ imagery ( max probing a wound in his side ; max making mud from his saliva ) just sit there without any irony . their relationship is handled delicately , and avoids the too obvious step into romance . but again there are swings into scenes without a note of truth , like an awkwardly acted group therapy session . by the time fearless hits its wrenching climax , a flashback to the moment of the crash wonderfully scored by maurice jarre , i felt as though i had been through a ride as bumpy as the passengers on that plane had . while max klein's character may not have endeared itself to me , bridges' performance did . like he did in starman , bridges carries himself like an alien among us , but this time an alien with some smugness . this performance shores up my judgment of bridges as the best american leading actor around , and it almost holds fearless together on its own . however , fearless takes its metaphysics too seriously , and doesn't keep its eye on what works best : the reactions of two survivors to a world now seen with different eyes . 
director : lasse halstrom . mpaa rating : r ( adult themes , profanity , sexual situations , violence ) running time : 125 minutes . a word of sympathy , first of all , for the marketing and publicity people at miramax films . i guarantee you i would not want the job of selling to the american public a film in which the character arc of the protagonist is completed by performing an abortion . they'll avoid the subject assiduously , of course , focusing instead on the idea that the cider house rules is about a journey to self-awareness , about learning to make complex choices , and so on , and et cetera , and yada yada , all of which is even ( more or less ) true . it's also true that john irving has no qualms about being provocative , and that he's willing to cast performing abortions in a quasi-heroic light if it serves the purpose of one of his uniquely compassionate tales . the cider house rules isn't worth avoiding simply because of that one thematic element . . . nor , unfortunately , it is particularly worth seeking out . the relationship between larch and homer is the focal point , a strange father-son connection that gives two actors intriguing material to work with . caine is particularly good as larch , playing devilish advocate regarding the harsh realities of the world . irving tries to wink at the mawkishness ( plenty of dickensian references abound ) , but director lasse hallstrom spends a bit too much time lingering on the orphans' upturned faces . for a story that's ultimately not about orphans , the opening of the cider house rules is too much about orphans . to that end , tobey maguire proves to be a marvelous homer wells . his performance is a challenging mix of innocence and experience ; his face captures both a hard life and a life lived in isolation . he's certainly the best choice for an irving protagonist since robin williams' garp , but the cider house rules still can't quite achieve irving-style magic , even with irving himself doing the script honors . the narrative meanders appropriately between homer's relationship with candy , his work with the apple-picking crew and life back at the orphanage , yet the meandering just doesn't have that whimsical sense of purpose that marks irving's novels . it is most worth noting that the cider house rules on film packs 15 years of homer's life into about a year and a half . there may be no better evidence that irving is a writer whose stories really need to be turned into mini-series . the film does do a nice job conveying the theme that " situational morality " need not be an epithet ; indeed , this is may be one of the most deeply radical concepts you'll see on film this year . it is there you see a glimmer of the literary irving , one of the glimmers you can see in maguire and caine . too often , though , those glimmers are obscured by conventional filmmaking . maybe those marketing folk don't have such a tough job after all . in the cider house rules , you have to work a little too hard to find irving the provocateur . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : tim robbins . director : tim robbins . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , nudity , adult themes ) running time : 132 minutes . and a fairly tattered one , at that . controversy and the staging of " the cradle will rock " is the central story of cradle will rock , but it's far from the only one . and there are stories of anti-communist whistle-blowers like w . p . a . if that seems like a lot to digest , it is . robbins' sprawling narrative attempts to approach the era's growing class unrest from every possible angle , and in so doing can't quite do justice to any of them . characters with the potential to develop into something intriguing and complex -- like margherita sarfatti ( susan sarandon ) , a jewish propagandist for mussolini -- barely get enough screen time for you to remember who they are . in a cinematic season where epic running times are epidemic , cradle will rock clocks in at a meager-by-comparison 132 minutes , not nearly enough time to render all its stories fully . it's a shame , too , because cradle will rock often shows flashes of the compelling film that might have been . robbins has real visual flair as a director , including a great scene-setting opening steadicam shot and blitzstein's sleep-deprived creation of " cradle " ( accompanied by hallucinatory inspirations for its staging and commentary from his muse bertolt brecht . vanessa redgrave has a juicy role as mathers' " socially conscious " wife , who gets a rebellious thrill out of watching a " negro production of 'macbeth , ' " or helping welles' pirate performance of " cradle . " and there's the theater group , with macfayden chewing scenery as the egotistical welles and elwes his effective foil as houseman . you can't help but wish he had stayed more focused . in this era of fuming over the national endowment for the arts and its support of " questionable " works , cradle will rock's themes are certainly still timely . the problem with cradle will rock isn't politics , though , but a reach exceeding robbins' grasp . as an overview history lesson , cradle will rock has much to recommend it . as a film , it's too cursory a glance at too complex an issue . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : chris mcquarrie , bryan singer and michael feit dougan . director : bryan singer . public access is an ambitious , stylish film that manages to find itself both inches from brilliance and inches from complete impenitrability . it's a dark tale of family values gone awry , and manages to establish an effective tone of simmering menace . the problems really begin when that simmer should be turning into a boil . the first half of public access is thoroughly intriguing , introducing whiley in a manner that makes it clear that something about him is not quite right , but keeps you guessing as to what exactly it is . as long as whiley remains a mystery , public access is a gripping drama . what were whiley's motivations , or do they even matter ? a climactic confrontation between whiley and a vocal critic was disappointingly short on tension , and the pivotal montage which brings the film to a close seems so deliberately opaque that it's just off-putting . viewers of public access will likely find immediate similarities to david lynch's blue velvet . director and co-writer bryan singer seems not at all shy about paying homage to influences like lynch , alan parker and the coen brothers . unfortunately , he never quite combines all these elements into a style all his own . the interjection of a couple of eccentric public access programs is jarring , and leads the viewer to believe that public access is going to be * about * cable television , which it absolutely is not . nothing in singer's direction really stands out except lingering shots of a ceiling fan and a glass of water which scream " meaningful . " the technical credits are superb , particularly the evocative score and taut editing , both by san jose native john ottman . i do wish to single out ron marquette's performance as a creepy triumph . he provides a solid counterpoint to the naturalistic performances of the townspeople , and his rendering of whiley pritcher almost sells public access singlehandedly . when it comes right down to it , though , access isn't accessible enough , and it doesn't sprint to the finish . 
director : chris columbus . mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 132 minutes . and so robin williams' career has come full circle . well , you get the idea . i'm sure williams would not see things that way . he would describe a robust character arc , in which andrew comes to exhibit creativity and feeling , and begins a life-long quest to become more human . this incarnation , however , is directed by chris columbus , whose contributions to deep-thinking western cinema include home alone , home alone 2 and nine months . he's an unapologetic crowd-pleaser as a director , but a crowd-pleaser in the most irritating of ways . his is a style that favors low-brow gags and gee-whiz pacing , then feigns depth by wrapping things up with sentimental message-mongering ( and , in this particular case , three -- count them , _three_ -- death bed scenes ) . bicentennial man doesn't even manage the gee-whiz pacing ; after a moderately promising start , the film drifts into two hours of andrew growing ever more pensive about his place in the world . such pensiveness is likely meant to allow robin williams an uplifting acting showcase ( at least once andrew sheds his metal casing for williams' human face ) . williams has seemed inordinately fond of uplifting acting showcases lately , eschewing straight-ahead comedy for roles like patch adams , what dreams may come and jakob the liar . unfortunately , he's not doing himself any favors in his choices of material , heading for parts that allow him to do plenty of emoting between gags . there's no gravity to williams' performance as andrew , none of the conflicted pain of a being coming to terms with its own consciousness and its isolation in the world . that's because he's being directed by chris columbus , for whom gravity is just the thing that keeps his films from floating away entirely . when bicentennial man sticks to light comedy , it's not half bad . when it takes its epic scope too seriously , it's more than half bad . bicentennial man does boast solid work from its supporting cast of davidtz , neill and particularly platt ( for my money , now the most reliable comic actor in film ) . the technical credits are top-notch , with one wild scene in which platt molds artificial flesh into williams' face . there's also plenty of opportunity to watch the film grow ponderous in the long stretches between laughs , and to consider how stale robin williams' once-promising career has become . bicentennial man's few simple pleasures can't make up for its shallow philosophizing -- or the sense that , for robin williams , everything old is nanoo again . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : david loughery . director : stephen herek . pejoratives all , and all suggesting something constructed in a zealously commercial fashion . that's exactly what the latest incarnation of the three musketeers is : pitch meeting filmmaking in all its overstuffed glory . what is astonishing is that something vaguely resembling entertainment emerged . thanks to a high-energy finale and a wonderfully goofy performance by oliver platt , the three musketeers narrowly avoids complete disaster . the first is that the casting has virtually nothing to do with appropriateness for the character . he appears to believe that a frown is sufficient for showing melancholia , and he delivers every line exactly the same , as though he were in dire need of more fiber in his diet . charlie sheen is a bit better for aramis , but he too is just plain under-talented . chris o'donnell turns d'artagnan into a bland puppy dog , all youthful bluster and no charisma . his lecherous grinning and campy one-liners are supposed to be amusing , but i found them merely sad . my first rule of action/adventure films--that they're only as good as their villains--once again proves true . fortunately , as uninteresting as the rest of the cast is , oliver platt is that engaging . his comic-relief porthos could have been awful , but he plays it with devilish enthusiasm . every moment he's on screen is worth watching , and the laughs he generates are as much out of the fun he is so clearly having as they are from anything in the script . the other big-time mistake is a screenplay by david loughery and direction by stephen herek that cobbles together elements that worked somewhere else , apparently under the impression that great pieces from other films would add up to another great film . we get spielberg's trademark zoom-to-closeup , and entrances and exits by richelieu , complete with billowing cape and ominous underscore , that have " cardinal vader " written all over them . the chase scenes and duels are lively and fun , but never seemed to be in the flow of the story . one of these duels was so reminiscent of the princess bride that two different members of the audience shouted out , " prepare to die " at exactly the same time . the three musketeers just doesn't hold together , often looking like it was edited together from other much better adventure films . yet for all its calculatedness , i must admit that musketeers does at least part of what it sets out to do : provide brainless mass-market adventure . after a sluggish first hour , it hits a gallop and cruises to the finish with gusto . the closing half hour is nearly non-stop action , some of it surprisingly good . perhaps most important , the kids seemed to love it . while somewhat violent , it's mostly slapstick , and appropriate for most of the family . i didn't laugh a lot , but others did , and there was some genuine applause . so go figure . the three musketeers will be compared frequently to richard lester's definitive 1974 version , which is certainly a much better film overall . disney's version doesn't pretend to aim for real wit or originality , just a big-budget , big-name piece of cotton candy . there are worse ways to spend a matinee . 
screenplay : paul rudnick . director : barry sonnenfeld . there were plenty of things surrounding the first addams family film that i hated more than the film itself : its undeserved status as blockbuster ; the stupendously annoying theme song by hammer ; endless iterations of the word " ooky " in print . 1991's the addams family was not a terrible film . it was high-spirited and gleefully performed . it simply exhausted its premise after about fifteen minutes . addams family values is lots more of the same , which means that its premise is exhausted before it begins . yet it's both worse and better than its predecessor , the latter the result of christina ricci's marvelously morbid wednesday . like many recent megasequels , addams family values meticulously recreates the original , element for element . the script is once again largely a collection of black-humored sight gags and one-liners , and the theme song is again rap ( a slightly altered version of tag team's excruciating hit " whoomp ! even the title design is the same ; " no surprises " is clearly the motto in place . the only real question is , is it funny , and as in the case of the addams family the answer is " sometimes . " there aren't as many laughs as there were in the original , but the laughs that do come are bigger . there's a great photo among the shots of debbie's previous disguises , and the summer camp play is an anarchic riot . what almost never worked for me were the jokes in the " setup . . . macabre retort " format . i kept wanting to yell out , " all right , they're weird , i get the point . " values is broken into three almost entirely unrelated subplots ( not that plot is an issue here ) . the debbie/uncle fester plot is extremely sluggish ; joan cusack tries gamely , but doesn't quite click as the villainous black widow . the biggest surprise may be that gomez and morticia play a very small role in the proceedings . they get a nice , goofy dance sequence , but for most of the film raul julia only reacts , while anjelica huston spends her time hitting lighting marks so that her eyes and cheekbones appear translucent . the summer camp subplot is far and away the best , and ricci is a demonic delight . ricci spits out her lines with comic venom , and provides most of values' highlights . the easiest conclusion to reach about addams family values is that it will probably please those it was made to please , the same folks who brought over $100 million to the addams family . if you didn't like the original formula , there's little to inspire a change of heart the second time around . she deserves better . 
director : scott hicks . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( sexual situations , adult themes , violence , profanity ) running time : 127 minutes . several months ago , upon hearing that david guterson's much-respected novel _snow falling on cedars_ was being turned into a film , i made my usual effort to familiarize myself with the source material . after approximately 90 pages , i did something i almost never do : i surrendered . the grinding pacing of the story -- which , at the point i lost interest , had consisted almost entirely of a court proceeding -- did absolutely nothing to motivate persistence . whatever intriguing themes might have been contained in guterson's tale would never be known to me thanks to a narrative decision i considered crippling : waiting far too long to get to the point . this background is offered to make it clear that my ambivalence towards scott hicks' snow falling on cedars has nothing to do with affection for the source material . it also sets up the problem with the film , which is the same problem i had with the novel . it's not the first time the screen has seen a story of lovers separated by the japanese-american internment camps ( alan parker fumbled the similarly-themed come see the paradise ) , but that doesn't mean it's not an important story to tell . in fact , snow falling on cedars has an angle on the often-didactic issue of racism that makes it potentially compelling . those feelings , however , are not some easily dismissable bigotry . unfortunately , by the time it's clear how hicks and co-screenwriter ron bass are trying to personalize the murky matter of racism , the film is almost over . that leaves a film with two glaring flaws . the first is ethan hawke's performance as ishmael , which is so blank that the role might just as easily have been played by a cardboard cutout . hicks does a nice job with ishmael and hatsue's secretive adolescent trysts inside a hollow tree , but he doesn't do much to help us understand ishmael's longing . hawke plays most of his scenes with a thousand-yard stare we're expected to interpret as a combination of introspection and repressed emotion , while it could just as easily be interpreted as trying to remember where he left his car keys . by the time hicks tries to crank up the drama by cranking up james newton howard's score during a wildly overwrought sequence involving hatsue's " dear john " letter , it's too late to give the relationship the sense of consequence it demands . the second problem is the directorial self-indulgence exemplified by that " dear john " sequence , which shows up at every possible wrong time . there's too much film-making business going on for too long , and too little of the human story that should intensify the historical story . i didn't surrender on the film version of snow falling on cedars . i merely walked out unsatisfied , wondering why the story , like bad journalism , had to bury the lead . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
director : james mangold . it's time now for another chapter from scott's book of cinematic pet peeves . our subject today is something i refer to as characterization via accusation . it's that annoying thing some films do in which characters' psychological back-story is revealed not through the actions of those characters , but through the things other characters say about them in the middle of dramatic confrontations . it's the kind of lazy writing that can wound even a film like american beauty , as when ricky fitts tells angela " you're ugly and you're boring . . . and you know it . " film is a medium of showing , not telling . a script full of probing psychoanalytical dialogue is a script unable --or unwilling -- to show viewers what the characters are all about . that's a restraint james mangold's adaptation could have used a lot more of . well , lisa's just a good old-fashioned sociopath . through her experience , susanna begins to question who she is , and how easy it can be to be defined by others -- or even by yourself -- as crazy . mangold takes the subject just a bit farther , flashing back to susanna's life as a morose , directionless teenager in an upper class family . the problem is that the nurse has to tell her -- and , by extension , us . that's also only one of half a dozen or so scenes in which characters begin dissecting the others by revealing their deep , dark secrets . whatever points kaysen and mangold might have been trying to make about the fine line between sanity and insanity -- or about how those lines may be defined differently for women -- are lost in tearful breakdowns and manufactured drama . it would be remiss of me not to mention angelina jolie's performance as lisa , the wild child who serves as the ward's alpha female . it would be remiss not because jolie's performance is exceptional -- showy , flashy and fun , perhaps , though not exceptional -- but because it's a movie performance of a real-life character . everything in girl , interrupted seems designed to be satisfying as entertainment , not to be true to susanna kaysen's life or her unique perspective on that life . it's a movie that feels always and forever like a movie . that means punch lines and crescendos ; it means winona ryder shouting a story better told in quieter tones ; it means one of the worst false beards in film history on jared leto as susanna's boyfriend . and it means everyone telling everyone else how crazy they are or aren't , every character's story an open book . . . or , in this case , an open script . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : ehren kruger , based on characters created by kevin williamson . producers : kevin williamson , cathy konrad and marianne maddalena . director : wes craven . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 116 minutes . that's as succinct a summation as any for why , as this particular trilogy draws to a close , it feels one chapter too long . scream revived the moribund slasher movie genre by mining both laughs and scares from horror film conventions . scream 2 kept the pace by turning the satire towards horror sequels , and even the first scream . scream 3 , it turns out , does forget the rules . it forgets that a film based on scary parody of scary movie cliches had better be scary or funny , but not cliched . it seems someone connected to the film is creating his/her own murderous rewrites on the fly . there are suspects a-plenty -- homicide det . director wes craven and screenwriter ehren kruger ( stepping in for creator kevin williamson ) get so focused on whodunnit , in fact , that they rarely give any juice to what the person whodunnit is doing . there are a couple of tense moments , including effective use of a one-way mirror and the surprising perils of a movie set , but there's nothing to match the nerve-wracking drew barrymore sequence in scream or the crawl across the killer in scream 2 . as a chiller , it's fairly uninspired chase-n-shriek stuff . the humor doesn't fare much better , drifting away from commentary on movies to linger on commentary on movie-making . kruger tosses off some solid gags , but they tend to be of the industry-jokey variety ( including a few cute but unnecessary cameos ) . he even misses some obvious opportunities , letting characters split up in a big spooky house with nary an ironic observation and making everyone too stupid to draw connections when the killer uses an electronic device to mimic voices . it becomes too easy to see scream 3 as a step towards exactly the kind of formulaic horror film the series originally skewered . even when the humor works , it feels too easy -- and too played -- to take shots at the people who make the movies than to take shots at the movies themselves . kruger opts to chuckle at career-obsessed directors , bimbo starlets who don't know vertigo from psycho and genre film actors getting absurdly method about creating their " characters . " the height of irony is that you can see that kind of deadly earnest acting going on in scream 3 . she does her damndest to make sure we all understand how haunted she is , as though anyone could possibly care about the deep psychological underpinnings of sidney prescott . it's one thing for a character to make a reference to the developments in the godfather trilogy ; it's another for campbell to pretend she's playing michael corleone . scream 3 is a purely functional shocker , but it takes all the wrong things seriously and plays all the wrong things for laughs . craven and company have forgotten the rules , all right . they've even forgotten why the series was worth a third installment in the first place . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
director : danny boyle . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , violence , nudity , graphic gore , profanity , drug use ) running time : 116 minutes . what else do you need to know about me ? " it's an intriguing start , except for one small problem : there's a lot more we need to know about richard . in fact , there's a lot more we need to know about virtually everyone and everything in the beach . director danny boyle's travelogue-cum-human nature treatise proves to be a tremendously frustrating experience -- it's a lazy film that thinks it's being profound . soon richard begins suspecting that the threats to the community from without -- edgy marijuana farmers , more americans -- may be less troubling than the threats from within . during its first hour , the beach does an effective job of setting tone , largely through the efforts of superb technical craftsmen . the island locations are spectacular , and donald mcalpine's production design of the islanders' camp is a tidy marvel . the beach wants to set up an initial dichotomy -- the pasteurized pleasures of most tourist destinations compared to the raw glory of the island -- that eventually proves to be false . on a visual level , it's hard not to argue that boyle and company succeed . unfortunately for boyle and company -- and for you , john or jane q . potential audience member -- the characters eventually have to play a role in the film . when they do , it becomes quite clear that nobody understands why anybody is doing anything . richard's vague motivations and frustrations over sanitized tourist experiences seem provocative as the film begins , but soon the script begins dropping in details about his past -- e . g . he's a video game junkie -- without bothering to explain why that matters except as an excuse for boyle to include an admittedly creative fantasy sequence . that complete apathy over exploring motivation spills over into every other character , as screenwriter john hodge never bothers with the tiny matter of what the islanders want their paradise to represent , or why sal above all others treats the place as a holy secret . the characters -- including dicaprio , whose performance is about as good as you can expect in a role so under-written -- generally appear to be occupying space and serving plot functions , to the ridiculous extreme that the head marijuana farmer gives a knowing nod after his solution to the film's climactic problem proves him a worthy successor to solomon in the despotic wisdom department . of course , letting the complexities of the characters come to the surface would have required some actual effort , as opposed to offering up the premise as it stands . it's ridiculously obvious thematic material , yet the makers of the beach seem convinced that presenting that theme is enough to earn them philosophical style points . ultimately , style points are all they earn , though they earn those style points in impressive quantities . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : john milius and larry gross . director : walter hill . to paraphrase the old song , and to make a distressing confession , i don't know much about history . when approaching a film based on historical subject matter , i rarely find myself basing my critique on accuracy , for better or worse . nevertheless , i had a feeling i was going to have a problem with geronimo : an american legend as sool as i noted that wes studi , who portrays the title character , had been given fourth billing . as authentic as it looks , geronimo just doesn't click because it doesn't make its principal character the focus of the story . like dances with wolves , it's not so much a story about native americans as it is about guilty white men . perhaps the most glaring problem with the script for geronimo is that it doesn't seem to have a direction or a clear enough sense of its point of view . although the narration is coming from davis , geronimo is not a first-person narrative . much takes place without him present , so it's difficult to see events as they develop as somehow having an impact on davis . when davis gives an impassioned statement near the end of the film about his shame at the government's treatment of the apache , i found myself wondering why he was the one to get that scene . as questionable as the decision to let the story come from a white man might be , geronimo at least should have had the conviction to show us more through his eyes once that decision was made , so that davis' loss of innocence makes sense . screenwriters john milius and larry gross also do a less than impressive job of making geronimo himself come alive . wes studi is grim-faced and taciturn , but his anger is never real enough . geronimo is treated more as a symbol than a man , and i came away from the film with very little insight into his character . all this is not to say that geronimo doesn't do many things right . cinematographer lloyd ahern does some of the year's finest work , capturing the southwestern deserts in rich reds and oranges . gene hackman and robert duvall both turn in typically marvelous performances , finding much more nuance than the script provides , and their one scene together is truly great work . ry cooder's score is also noteworthy . in fact , everything about geronimo screams " epic , " but somewhere along the line a fair amount of substance leaked out of the stylish wrapper . geronimo : an american legend clocks in at about 1 : 55 , short by the standards of the holidays' other big releases , yet it seemed much longer . a barroom showdown with a group of bounty hunters didn't seem to serve any real purpose , and the editing generally seemed disjointed . geronimo wants to be revisionist , but it doesn't provide enough real information , or compelling enough characters to make me care . somewhere amidst the cliches is the story of a warrior who fought and killed for what was being taken from him , but it didn't make it to the screen in this version . in a case of an extremely misleading title , geronimo : an american legend doesn't do enough to make a real historical figure real . 
screenplay : mark steven johnson . director : donald petrie . in a sense , there's really not all that much to say about a movie like grumpy old men . it's the kind of movie one generally describes with somewhat faint-praise adjectives like " cute , " or " fun , " or " entertaining . " grumpy old men is all of these things , to a point . there are a couple of belly laughs , but there's not much genuine spark . for all its manufactured whimsy , grumpy old men is basically a sit-com , a moderately diverting 105-minute episode of " the golden boys . " the beautiful and spirited airel attracts the attention of both men , but neither is brave enough to make the first move . so when ariel makes the first move--for both of them--old animosities are stirred to the boiling point . for one thing , it's simply a pleasure to see lemmon and matthau together again . the trouble is that they're not given all that much to do besides call each other " moron " and " putz . " there are a few nice bits of physical humor , notable lemmon spraying matthau with a garden hose and matthau taking an ax to a foot of ice in a futile attempt to retrieve his prized ice-fishing pole . but for the most part grumpy old men just strolls along , apparently convinced that we're so comfortable with the actors that we'll find anything they do amusing . the other characterizations in grumpy old men are wildly uneven . on the plus side is ann-margret , who is positively luminous . she's perfect for the role of ariel , radiating a joie de vivre which would clearly be appealing to the two icy septugenarians . there is a marvelous warmth to her scenes with lemmon and matthau , and i was sorry that her part wasn't even larger . he appears briefly for the express purpose of being cantankerous and sexually suggestive , once again proving that it's supposed to be funny that older people think about sex , too . their characters don't serve much purpose , and while both actors are very appealing , i couldn't figure out what the point was . grumpy old men does nothing to offend overtly . the photography of the snow-covered minnesota town is bright and atmospheric , particularly the ice-fishing village ; alan silvestri adds a cheerful if somewhat pedestrian score . there are enough chuckles in the film to make it a decent matinee diversion , but overall grumpy old men relies far too much on the history between lemmon and matthau , and far too little on anything particularly clever in mark steven johnson's script . 
screenplay : peter mullan . director : peter mullan . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , adult themes , sexual situations ) running time : 97 minutes . you can't quite prepare for the possibility that your enjoyment of a film will hinge on subtitles . those translating captions are truly a mixed blessing for the worldly cineaste . on the one hand , they're infinitely preferable to wretched dubbing that sucks the life out of performances . then there are the oddest cases , where english is translated back into english due to concern over the intelligibility of thick accents : trainspotting , my name is joe and the 1997 scottish comedy-drama orphans , just now making its way to american screens . there's some pretty interesting stuff going on in orphans . i only wish the subtitling hadn't distracted me virtually every minute of the film . and sheila ( rosemarie stevenson ) -- wheelchair-bound with an unspecified condition , perhaps cerebral palsy -- simply wants to avoid the funeral altogether . the siblings' adventures are entirely episodic , and therefore -- not surprisingly -- of widely varying quality . the tone varies radically as well -- i don't know what twisted flight of writer/director peter mullan's fancy inspired michael's run-in with an ill-tempered pub owner -- but on balance the stronger segments and the solid performances make orphans well worth watching . unless , of course , the subtitles make you want to apply the palm of your hand to your forehead in a disco beat . it's not just that the accents , though thick , seem fairly understandable without any visual aids . it's not just that the subtitler seeks to prove that point by arbitrarily opting to let several lines of dialogue stand on their own . no , it's really the cringe-inducing job the subtitler does of not merely transcribing , but translating ( eliminating contextually obvious colloquial expressions in favor of their blander synonyms ) . and not just translating , but editing ( the subtitler steadfastly refuses to place a certain magic four-letter word on screen , and often substitutes " damn " for " f * * * ing " ) . the result is an art house film experience that's intellectually insulting : a movie delivered to a theatrical audience as though it were the airline version . you can't blame mullan for such a godawful decision ; in fact , i feel sorry for him . he's made a film which , while flawed , has some provocative things to say about grief and family , wrapped up in turns of plot and character that are downright shakespearean . that should have been the film american audiences were allowed to see , not this bizarre approximation in which the subtitles are wrapped around the film like a strip of paper on a hotel room toilet , sanitizing it for your protection . if this is what subtitle purists are going to get for their buck , maybe it's time to reconsider hiring americans to do a dub job . i can listen to a botched , scene-ruining translation just as easily as someone i can read it . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
a few months ago , i was at a press screening for another touchstone film which was preceded by a teaser trailer for mission to mars . as the trailer unfolded , the critics in the audience began to snicker with increasing frequency . the imagery used was startling similar to images from 2001 : a space odyssey -- an astronaut in a white room , an approach to a dark object in the distance , a figure spinning off into space . it was comical not just because of the familiarity , but because it seemed so quintessentially brian de palma . the train station sequence in the untouchables came from eisenstein's potemkin ; the single-take opening sequence in snake eyes felt like welles' touch of evil ; whole heaping chunks of his early films appropriated hitchcockian devices and themes . so why wouldn't de palma take on the most iconic science-fiction film ever made while making his first science-fiction film ? why not add kubrick to his list of victims of auteur homage ? it's more alarming that it's similar to the cookie-cutter hollywood approach to any story . the frustrating thing about any brian de palma film is that you can always count on at least one extended sequence where you realize what a brilliant technical craftsman he can be . a chain reaction of events following that accident keeps building tension , leading to some genuinely tense moments . de palma's sense for timing this sort of sequence is impeccable -- recall the editing of tom cruise's computer room break-in in mission : impossible -- leading to the hope that mission to mars can maintain that sort of visual and emotional energy . and then you remember this is brian de palma . every once in a while , by sheer twisted accident , de palma ends up working with a rich , smart script -- the untouchables , blow out , carlito's way . more often , you get the impression that he looks for a script with a few places he can show off his visual flair . mission to mars has its showcase sequence , but it also has a leaden script full of plug-and-play characterizations . it's the sort of mawkish back-story screenwriters use all the time in adventure films , in a token -- and usually futile -- attempt to show that the people matter more than the concept . ironically , mission to mars is that rare case where the concept does matter more than the people . when mission to mars gets metaphysical , it makes sure there's someone on hand to narrate every brutally obvious revelation , and someone whose individual journey to wholeness will be completed by this close encounter . this film doesn't end with the awe of creation ; it ends with tedious exposition topped off by an interplanetary clasping of hands . there are flashes of brian de palma the visceral thrill-master in mission to mars , but he doesn't seem to know what to do with its limp conclusion . this time around , it probably would have been a good idea . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : ron nyswaner . director : jonathan demme . maybe i've just been lucky , but after living in northern california for almost ten years i no longer think of " tolerance " as merely a buzzword ; it's part of the fabric of life . consequently , i couldn't help but feel slightly patronized by the sense of outrage which provides the backbone of jonathan demme's philadelphia . the message was important , but to me , it wasn't news . when that message is stripped away to permit examination of the filmmaking , i find as many examples of what i consider bad decisions as i find good decisions , and too many characters who come off as walking allegories . it is to screenwriter ron nyswaner's credit that it doesn't offer the stock scene of a doctor delivering the somber news ; hiv from the outset is simply one element in andrew's life , but not the defining element . philadelphia sets the stage effectively , making the way this case will affect the two men the focal point of the story . as a courtroom drama , philadelphia is fairly pedestrian stuff , lacking real dramatic punch and giving in to preachy speeches . demme makes the extremely questionable decision of framing much of one lengthy trial sequence from andrew's perspective as he grows weaker . there are distracting camera angles and sound echoes which make it difficult to concentrate on what anyone involved is actually saying . andrew's condition became the total focus at a time when it simply wasn't appropriate in the narrative . outside the courtroom things aren't much better . philadelphia's most talked-about scene involves andrew responding to an aria , a scene which seems calculated to be one of those tour-de- force moments that wins oscars . i found it way over the top . hanks' performance has been touted as an oscar front-runner , and while he makes some bold choices , i don't feel it's the best work he's done , or even the best work he's done this year . by far the best work , and the most dynamic character , is denzel washington's joe miller . once again washington fills the screen with energy , and isn't afraid to show miller's warts , making him a very real typical american . as with the wedding banquet , i went into philadelphia wanting to like it and glad that it had been made . but once again i felt the message deserved a better messenger , one that treats homosexuality as matter-of-factly as the recent tales of the city miniseries on pbs . philadelphia is a good idea , just not a particularly good film . 
screenplay : michael seitzman . director : mark piznarski . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , sexual situations ) running time : 97 minutes . mark piznarski's here on earth does not take place here on earth . welcome to the world of here on earth : planet melodrama . i'm not about to dismiss melodrama out of hand ; if daytime drama , professional wrestling and romance novels are any indication , people still love conflicts writ large and lacking in moral shadings . even titanic , for all its spectacle , was essentially melodrama . but melodrama also has its own rules , and here on earth consistently violates them . there are , of course , impediments to the kelley/samantha coupling in michael seitzman's script . and there's a twist of medical tragedy in store down the line . the two leads therefore proceed to play their embarrassingly scripted courtship for just the hollywood concoction that it is . their relationship doesn't resemble anything you would ever see between two actual human 18-year-olds , but that's fine . when sam silences kelley's fumbled attempt at an apology with an all-forgiving finger to the lips , you know you've been spending time in a place where romanticism trumps reality . still , there are little things that never feel right about this world . in fact , you'd almost root for jasper to win out , if not for the fact that you may spend most of the film wanting desperately to reach through the screen to comb his hair . there's no moment of melodramatic satisfaction from seeing the bad guy get a good telling-off . for a melodrama , here on earth seems awfully reluctant even to have a bad guy . i'm not sure whether i could have embraced even a fully melodramatic here on earth . even in its basic premise , it's too awkward a melding of adult tear-jerker and doe-eyed teen appeal romance . still , there's no question that melodrama can work when those involved are unashamed about the fact that they're creating melodrama . that's why people cheer and boo at wrestling matches ; it's why people spend 20 years following their favorite soap operas . that should have been why the bonding of kelley and sam across opposite sides of the tracks would provide an emotionally cathartic experience . instead , it's a half-hearted effort in a genre where heart is all that matters . the makers of here on earth have made a visit to planet melodrama . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
director : steve miner . for a while there , i had declared a personal moratorium on disney's live-action formula pictures . although i found cool runnings moderately entertaining , i realized that was about as much as i could expect : a smile here , a chuckle there , something i'd take my kids to see if i had any and wanted to get them out of the house on a saturday afternoon . with the presence of gerard depardieu , i had slightly higher hopes for my father the hero , but i was kidding myself . while he lends a roguish charm to the proceedings , he's still trapped in a movie which seems designed more to divert than to entertain . it would be one thing if my father the hero were simply predictable , which it is , but it is also just badly written . my father the hero is based on a french film i have not seen titled mon pere , ce heros , but it is hard to believe that the characters could have been as fuzzy as they are here . the lies are just a device , and even if we believe it's just adolescence at work there's no particular reason to care . one doesn't necessarily expect well-rounded characters from a film like my father the hero , but one should at leas find reasonably coherent types . still , as silly and incoherent as the script may be , gerard depardieu still gets to read many of the lines , and he has superb comic timing . but it's part of the problem that he has such a rapport with everyone ; if part of the point is that andre needs to become a better father and a more selfless person , we never see any indication that he is anything but a perfectly nice guy , if slightly overprotective . there would have been so many more comic possibilities in a rakish playboy being saddled with everyone's belief that he is a cradle-robber . heigl is lovely as nicole , perhaps too lovely ; i'm not sure why she'd need to lie to hook anyone . my father , the hero is wholesome , good-natured and does virtually nothing to offend . but it needs more than that , namely something to make it worth ninety minutes of anyone's time . gerard depardieu is fun to watch , and proves surprisingly adept at physical comedy . it would have been nice to see him work with a script that seemed to have any imagination or sense of structure behind it . 
how's this for damnation via faint praise : i'm pretty impressed that 28 days didn't turn out to be an utterly unwatchable disaster . there aren't many film premises that would set off my early crap alert system like a feel-good comedy-drama about folks in a rehab clinic ( maybe robin williams in a feel-good comedy-drama about a robot who wants to be human ) . you've got your pathos , you've got your cheap emotion , you've got your showy drunken scenes for actors and you've got your central character arc so rigidly defined you could set your watch by when denial turns into a great big group hug . i've got to hand it to director betty thomas for lending 28 days a little dark edge , and to screenwriter susannah grant for delivering a few more solid laughs than i was expecting . unfortunately , they're still not able to overcome the basic flaws in their story . emphasis on the " long " and " slow . " there are more than a few good gags to be found in the interaction between the support group members , but there's nothing driving the narrative forward once gwen decides to go straight . it's not that the process of recovery ends with one decision , of course . in 28 days , however , the process of drama does end with that one descision , leaving the film to grab at relationships and confrontations that never go anywhere . those moments might have seemed more vital if not for the uninspired performance by sandra bullock . it feels like i've been a bullock booster long after most others have leapt from her feisty-cute bandwagon , but there's little going on behind her attitude in 28 days . at least her post-sobriety scenes are a reprieve from her cartoon rendition of staggering drunkenness . in this role , bullock looks like she's completely out of her depth . betty thomas does do a nice job with altered perspectives , shooting hazy memories in grainy video and capturing some funny confessional scenes with an i'm-the-center-of-the-world iris effect . there is the small problem that those confessionals don't really belong in 28 days , but there's no solid sense of what belongs throughout the story . the fragmentation of family , the different paths taken by two adult children of an alcoholic and the challenges of forgiveness could have made for a much more compelling sub-text than a half-hearted romantic triangle with eddie at the other vertex . 28 days offers some effective comedy , and it does manage to avoid pathos and cheap emotion . in fact , with its fragmented narrative and limp lead performance , it comes close to avoiding emotion altogether . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
director : stanley tucci . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , brief nudity ) running time : 104 minutes . 1996's big night , co-directed with campbell scott , was a beautiful low-key gem , easily one of that year's best films . 1998's the impostors , tucci's debut as a solo director , was an amusing but slight piece of episodic farce . yes indeed , tucci's development as a film-maker continues -- slowly but steadily -- in reverse . mitchell turns gould into the subject of one of his profile pieces , turning gould into an even bigger bohemian celebrity in the process . there's no question that the eccentric gould makes for just as interesting a character today as he would have made 40 years ago . it just never appears that tucci knows exactly what to do with that character . he fiddles about with analogies between josephs gould and mitchell as deliberate writers and human chroniclers , suggesting the very fine line between those who can manage their neuroses and those who can't . and that's about all he does with any of his themes -- he fiddles and toys and nods , leaving joe gould's secret to drift along with little more than its value as historical curiosity to hold it all together . mostly , tucci indulges ian holm as gould . it's the kind of role that screams for oscar attention , infinitely more flamboyant than holm's devastating turn in the sweet hereafter yet infinitely less deserving of praise . sometimes holm nails the sad soul of the exhibitionist gould , and even when the performance isn't perfect it's still plenty interesting to watch . the interplay between holm and tucci makes for most of the best moments in joe gould's secret , but there's always the nagging sense that this should have been more than a showy character study . every once in a while , tucci makes the kind of interesting film-making choices that show what he's capable of . there are a few crafty sequences in which characters duck in and out of the frame , the individual speakers subjugated to the conversation and the space between them . there are also dozens of tiny distractions that make hard to view joe gould's secret as more than a potentially provocative missed opportunity . it's ironic that the story chides notions of celebrity , then casts susan sarandon and steve martin in cameo appearances . it's even more ironic that , in a story of artistic indecision , tucci can't quite settle on a solid center for his film . joe gould's secret is the sort of film you find fitfully interesting while never really finding it gripping . it found me lamenting the direction tucci's behind-the-camera career has taken , increasingly wondering whether campbell scott might have been the real talent behind big night . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : stuart gordon , dennis paoli & nicholas st . john . director : abel ferrara . abel ferrara's body snatchers marks the third screen adaptation of jack finney's novel the body snatchers , and you'd think that there wouldn't be all that much new to say about pod people by now . the scene for this latest adaptation is an army base , and the metaphor has changed as well . somewhere in body snatchers is a poke at the military mindset , but it's buried beneath layers of atmosphere , atmosphere which works but doesn't make that extra leap to real terror . director ferrara ( bad lieutenant ) has crafted a stylish and spooky look for the film , filtered in dark ambers and deep blues , full of shadows and twisted angles . the issue of identity is always present , as actors frequently appear only as silhouettes against the light , or veiled by other shadows . some early scenes highlighting the pod people's uniformity , particularly a frighteningly comic scene where young andy realizes the other kids in day care lack a certain artistic creativity , are extremely well-handled . ferrara also manages the tricky task of directing his actors so that the transformed characters appear clearly to have changed without playing the stock blank-faced automoton . technically , body snatchers hits just about all of its marks , particularly with its rather graphic image of what happens to the remains of a human body after the transformation has taken place . yet while body snatchers held my attention , it didn't do anything particularly interesting which seemed to warrand a re-telling of this already twice-told tale . the screenwriters throw in one speech by the base commander ( full metal jacket's r . lee ermey ) which seems designed to emphasize this point , but ferrara doesn't do much with it . no single theme really drives this body snatchers , nor are any of the characters interesting enough to pull it along with them . structurally , body snatchers suffers from a climax which seems far too drawn out . once the malones start running , the tension should continue to build , but too many of the scenes involving confrontations between " real " humans and the 'snatchers lack punch . there is one wickedly chilling moment of revelation , but it is isolated . body snatchers does a fantastic job of establishing its tone , and it does offer a few decent scares . the problem with ferrara's pacing is that it's like the body snatchers themselves : too cool when the adrenaline should be flowing . 
the term has at times been used to define any film which women tend to like more than men ( sleepless in seattle comes to mind ) , but in its strictest sense i define a " chick film " as one which deals with relationships men could only attempt to comprehend : mother-daughter , female friendships , and birth mother-child . angie definitely falls within this framework . it's got mothers , daughters , friends , childbirth and a dose of heartbreak to guarantee maximum lacrimal viscosity , and all these things may affect the target audience . i found myself impressed by geena davis' performance , but bothered by the obvious and excessive manipulation which never really pays off , and by some unfortunate mixed messages . davis plays the title character , bensonhurst , brooklyn resident angie scacciapensieri . geena davis' performance as angie is easily the best thing about angie , which is fine because it's also the most important thing . most of davis' roles to date have emphasized her comic talents , but angie confirms what thelma & louise suggested : that davis is a very gifted all around actor . stephen rea is also extremely slick and charming as noel , and the scenes between davis and rea provide many of angie's highlights . through its first hour , angie is an interesting and appealing character drama with real promise . the second half of todd graff's script suffers from two major problems . the first is that it seriously overloads on emotional high points . there were at least four separate points at which i thought that angie had reached its climax , and what made that decision the most frustrating is that none of them quite provided the catharsis that angie needed but always just missed . i got the feeling that hollywood pictures had tested several endings , found that the audiences responded to each one , and then decided to keep them all . consequently , angie loses its narrative momentum two thirds of the way through and coasts to the finish on its tear-jerking . the second , and perhaps more distracting , problem is a rather personal distaste for what i perceived as a sell-out in the change in angie's perspective which occurs at the end of the film . a speech angie makes to her baby surprised me by suggesting that angie believed her problem was thinking too much about herself , when i felt she was thinking about herself for the first time in her life . the fits and starts in the film's many climaxes left me wondering what it was that i was supposed to have learned from angie's story . it is a given that a film like angie pulls emotional strings , and that in itself is not a failing . manipulating our emotions is what films are supposed to do ; the best ones just manage to do it so skillfully that we don't notice or don't care . angie doesn't achieve that deft middle ground . it crosses its signals , piles on the pathos , and leaves its star to carry most of its emotional baggage . 
for approximately five minutes , the computer-animated dinosaur is undeniably spectacular . the story creeps up without dialogue , following the fate of one little dinosaur egg from its trampled , abandoned nest across an astonishing primeval landscape . seven years removed from the revolutionary screen creations of jurassic park , i didn't think it would be possible for the mere sight of digital dinosaurs to seize the imagination , but it happens in dinosaur nonetheless . with its entirely visual storytelling , dinosaur's prologue offers a giddiness-inducing prospect : an introduction to a lost world as quietly , primally engrossing as kubrick's " dawn of man " prologue to 2001 : a space odyssey . and then a cute little simian opens its stupid mouth . i knew going into dinosaur that it was a disney film aimed at kids , so i can't say i was expecting anything more profound than the story it ultimately provided . that didn't make its presence any less disappointing . yaaaaaaawwn . disney's animated features have generally been pretty formulaic , so it's no shock to discover that dinosaur features a by-the-numbers script . this variation , however , is so relentlessly somber and dreary that there's nothing left but formula . the personalities of the principal characters are so bland and the vocal performances so uninspired that the characters threaten to disappear into the backgrounds -- no small feat considering the overwhelming brown-ness of the desolate post-apocalyptic scenery . even the minor characters like zini and eema -- those theoretically present to provide a little comic relief -- can't inject any life into the film . in recent disney films , the musical numbers have come off as purely obligatory , but i found myself pleading for a snappy tune to breathe some life into the film . it's hard to imagine what young viewers would find to embrace in this grim production , and even harder to imagine what would keep an adult awake . there's no denying that the technology involved in the creation of dinosaur is extraordinary , mixing the computerized cast with some real-world settings so seamlessly that it's virtually impossible to tell where reality and hard drive overlap . apparently , however , co-director ralph zondag has become no more adept at dinosaur-driven storytelling than he was for the limp 1993 animated feature we're back ! that film seemed rushed into theaters to capitalize on that summer's jurassic juggernaut . this one misses its opportunity to step out of the spielbergian shadow , gradually devolving into a series of all-too-familiar set pieces . that's a sad end to a film that begins with so much promise . better to recycle disney's orphan fetish without a whiff of personality or humor , its early grandeur slowly but steadily fading into extinction . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
starring : nicolas cage , shirley maclaine . screenplay : hugh wilson and peter torokvei . director : hugh wilson . i mean no condescension when i say that guarding tess is the kind of movie that my grandparents would love . they see about a movie per year , if that , and when they do choose to plunk down their $7 . 00 a piece they tend to opt for something light and frothy , usually one of those comedies featuring two decent but strong-willed characters who spar but obviously care about each other . these films are always good for a few smiles , and are generally inoffensive . intellectually , i understand the appeal of such once- in-a-blue-moon-night-on-the-town entertainments , and some of them do give the character interaction zing . it's just two pleasant , well-acted characters with nothing to do . guarding tess owes every ounce of charm it displays to the very engaging lead performances of nicolas cage and shirley maclaine . cage often seems to have only two gears on screen--frantic and manic--but here he des a surprisingly restrained turn as the frustrated agent . he is appropriately humorless about a job doug takes very seriously , yet he doesn't go for wooden . maclaine , who seems to get every role in hollywood written for a woman over 50 , has mastered the flinty dame bit by now , while always managing to leave a bit of softness around the edges . tess is not a particular stretch for maclaine , but she never mails in a performance . the interaction between doug and tess in the film's first half hour is amusing in a low-key way , never degenerating into over-the-top theatrics . at almost every stage the relationship seems completely natural , and that relationship makes for some entertaining scenes . what torpedoes guarding tess is the sense that director and co-writer hugh wilson didn't really know what to do with these two characters . since wilson's greatest success has come on the small screen , it should come as no surprise that guarding tess feels a lot like a pilot for a series . the characters are established , but the plot is nearly non-existent . very quickly , guarding tess begins to repeat itself , with too many redundant scenes of doug and tess butting heads , tess winning and doug fuming . it's a film that just floats around like a hovercraft on a layer of niceness . then , when wilson finally seems to realize the need for a second plot point , he creates an utterly ridiculous subplot involving a kidnapping . i have this feeling the conclusion we see was not his first choice . there is a silly red herring involving tess's son which i suspect was not a red herring in some earlier incarnation , because the revelation of who the kidnappers are inspires a big " what ? " i also believe wilson might have considered a slightly darker resolution , but was concerned about ruining all the good will he had worked so hard to generate . the result is just grossly out of touch with the rest of the movie anyway . fluffy and inconsequential doesn't have to mean tedious . guarding tess might make a fine bargain matinee for someone seeking a chuckle or two . at least that's what i'd tell my grandparents . 
director : mike figgis . late in mike figgis' experimental drama timecode , a young would-be film-maker pitches an idea to a hollywood production company for a film shot on digital video , following four characters in real time in one uninterrupted take . . . at which suggestion one of the production executives bursts into laughter and calls the idea " pretentious . " it seems like figgis is trying to have a little fun at his own expense , since that pitched idea is exactly the idea behind timecode : four characters followed in real time , the screen divided into four quadrants to follow their individual stories . and it would be easier to buy figgis' self-deprecation as genuine if he didn't then begin his closing credits with a caption describing exactly how the film had been made . " look what an interesting and original film you've just watched , " figgis says to us out of one corner of his mouth , while the other mutters , " and it was all just a big pretentious joke . " figgis has been on a kick in the last couple of years of trying to stretch cinematic boundaries , but it's too often too difficult to get past his art-for-art's-sake bluster . timecode was essentially improvised around a loose plot structure , leading to a predictably ragged feel to the film . and while figgis would probably emphasize that raggedness as a function of the film's realism and immediacy , it simply doesn't make for particularly engrossing viewing a lot of the time . at times timecode is a satire of film industry poseurs , and occasionally a very funny one . most intrusive of all is the use of a series of earthquakes as a device to shake up the lives of the characters . in a more conventional film , it might have been easier to forgive the obvious and repetitive symbolism . in a film like timecode , you begin wondering when figgis will ever take off his avant-garde hat and just let a story be a story . i might have considered timecode a thoroughly failed experiment if not for a development that briefly justifies the entire structure . in timecode , i was able to watch tripplehorn throughout the scene , from her puzzled but intent face as the background noise from the screening room prevents her from hearing rose , to the anguish that overwhelms her once it's impossible to deny the truth . film too rarely allows us to watch actors do purely physical acting . i was so fascinated by tripplehorn's wordless performance that i rarely took my eyes off of her quadrant of the screen , even when there was dialogue coming from elsewhere . i'd gladly accept a structure like that in timecode if it meant i could spend time following interesting supporting characters instead of blank-faced bores like burrows' depressed hollywood wife . of course , i'd prefer it if a film-maker acknowledged the importance of developing character and story , rather than assuming falsely that improvisation is always the best way to get at the " truth " of a situation . the snicker itself was a completely believable reaction ; the woman's puzzled expression , as though she had never before in her life heard a joke about her name , strains all credulity . figgis , however , never intrudes on his experiment in realism , not even so it might make more real-world sense . all that remains is his self-congratulation at doing something entirely new , even if it ultimately feels mostly like a big pretentious joke . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : robert towne , from a story by ronald d . moore and brannon braga . director : john woo . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , adult themes ) running time : 125 minutes . if i didn't know any better , i'd swear tom cruise was trying to steal a franchise out from under pierce brosnan . take a look at mission : impossible 2 for a moment , and see if the elements don't sound familiar : a government agent on a dangerous mission . a villain with a dastardly plot . a beautiful romantic interest . stunts , action sequences and high-tech gadgetry a-plenty . add a phenomenally talented action director like john woo to the mix , and maybe its time to ask q for a little cruise control on the old aston-martin . right ? not at all , as it turns out . john woo's last film was 1997's face/off , the latest in a long line of films ( a better tomorrow , the killer ) that showed the director's gift for mixing outrageous action sequences with strong character content . don't expect any such complexities from mission : impossible 2 . robert towne's script tries to provide an anchor in hunt's relationship with nyah , but it materializes so instantaneously that it's impossible to give it any weight or consequence . dougray scott , meanwhile , is an effectively nasty villain , but i'll be damned if i could figure out the history between him and hunt that's supposed to give their tete-a-tete more sock . anthony hopkins turns up for a couple of uncredited scenes as hunt's vaguely menacing new superior , then disappears without any further acknowledgement of his vague menace . every time woo slows things down for a moment of dramatic significance , it's just a longer time to dwell on the fact that there really isn't any dramatic signficance . mission : impossible 2 still could have been a great ride with plenty of that trademark woo action , and it gets off to a rousing start with a sequence showcasing hunt doing a little recreational rock-climing . once it does get going again , it doesn't really stop until the closing credits -- there are whiz-bang car chases , two-guns-a-blazing john woo shooting matches , slow-mo slugfests and bombs going off like the whole movie was timed to the end of the " 1812 overture . " it's great stuff , even if some of the devices are a bit too familiar from woo's other films , but by the time it finally rolls around it's almost too late . an action film with this much exposition better make the exposition worth our while , or the audience will just end up wondering why it was wasting valuable action time . the original 1996 mission : impossible was nobody's idea of classic cinema , but it did have that undeniably nerve-wracking computer room break-in sequence to go with its high-energy finale . mission : impossible 2 nods to that highlight in yet another break-in sequence , along with a nice gag about hunt's preferred operational style . i had hoped for more than homage to a mediocre blockbuster from john woo -- something with its own show-stopping set pieces and a compelling story to boot . but ultimately , there's no financial point to cooking up brilliant storytelling for a franchise , because people will come no matter what the film is " about . " that's why brosnan , mgm and the estate of ian fleming can rest easy that there will always be a market for their films , the tom cruises of the world be hanged . there's enough furiously paced woo action in the final forty minutes to keep mission : impossible 2 from crashing and burning ; there's just not enough to make it anything special , nor enough depth to the story to fill in the blanks between chases . anyone who's followed woo's career knows he's better than this material , but maybe there's only so much even a gifted film-maker can do with a product that's first and foremost about a brand name . the name on the director's chair can only get in the way . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : richard price and john singleton & shane salerno , based on the novel by ernest tidyman . director : john singleton . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 97 minutes . shaft . any questions ? " assuming the question isn't rhetorical , i'd like to pose one : exactly why is this film called shaft , anyway ? the original 1971 " blaxploitation " film may look rough and ridiculously dated to contemporary eyes -- it's hard to take seriously any film in which the word " whitey " plays such a prominent role -- but it was a fairly revolutionary portrayal of an african-american anti-hero as tough , sexual and beholden to absolutely no one . the presence of isaac hayes' famous theme song may tell you this is shaft , but is this story the one described in those famous lyrics ? the 1971 original was an audacious film in its low-budget way , including a scene in which shaft ( roundtree ) has sex with a white woman . it's depressing to realize that mainstream hollywood continues to be as timid as it ever was in portraying the sexuality of black men . aside from a stylized montage over the opening credits , jackson's shaft is practically asexual . there's plenty of danger all about in shaft , with two extremely effective villains . some viewers may find his performance the most outrageous latino crime boss parody since pacino tore up his cuban accent in scarface . i found something compelling and creepy about peoples , from his manic self-mutilation to his casual con artistry . between the two of them , bale and wright could have been the anchors of a better-than-average cop thriller , one that didn't have a title immediately creating a different set of expectations . no question , samuel l . jackson can be a bad mutha . in fact , there's so much emphasis on making him tough in a mad-as-hell way that jackson never captures shaft's toughness in an i-don't-have-anything-to- prove-to-anyone way . throughout the film , it becomes ever more clear that singleton has either misunderstood what made john shaft such an important screen character or found himself unable to convey that same essence . he also found himself unable to build a story that means anything , resorting to a climax that may be intended as a triumph over the system but ultimately renders the previous 90 minutes of action utterly pointless . i can't deny that i might have felt much more positively about shaft if it hadn't set itself up for comparison to an iconic film . there are some solidly entertaining moments here , perhaps enough to satisfy viewers with little or no awareness of the history behind the title . but there's that title before the film , a title that just feels wrong for what follows it on the screen . they're just not talkin' about shaft . and i can't dig it . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : kenneth lonergan , based on characters created by jay ward . producers : jane rosenthal and robert deniro . director : des mcanuff . mpaa rating : pg ( cartoon violence , mild profanity ) running time : 88 minutes . the adventures of rocky and bullwinkle is _not_ a bloated big-screen vehicle that misses the point of its source material entirely . indeed , the opening five minutes represent a surprsingly clever brand of self-awareness , the kind that promises a brisk and satisfying stroll dose of cartoon nostalgia . from the outset , it's clear that this is jay ward's rocky and bullwinkle , complete with adult references , howlingly awful puns and still more howlingly awful puns . could this finally be the kind of live-action cartoon hollywood has been trying to make for years , only to botch the job over and over again ? believe me , i wanted to get giddy over the adventures of rocky and bullwinkle , which opens with protagonists rocket j . squirrel and bullwinkle j . moose . it's a funny idea , as is the idea of fearless leader's plot to entrap a hollywood producer ( janeane garofolo ) by offering the movie rights to " rocky and bullwinkle . " jay ward's cartoons were always a strangely deft mix of smart and silly , which is a fairly accurate description of the adventures of rocky and bullwinkle for a few hundred blissful seconds . then , inevitably and tragically , we leave the hand-drawn world for something considerably more drab . whatever twisted force convinces studio executives that the flintstones , 101 dalmatians or rocky and bullwinkle have something more to offer us with human actors is in need of immediate exorcising . there's something about an animated world , even a crudely-drawn animated world , that changes the rules ; ward could get away with groaners that would make you want to stuff a sock in a human mouth that uttered them . it certainly doesn't help that some of the human actors appear befuddled by the whole enterprise . rene russo waits for about half an hour before she gets to utter a word of dialogue , and still looks like she's waiting around for the rest of the film . as for newcomer piper perabo , what little comedic timing she may have isn't enhanced by acting opposite a pair of visual effects . deniro has fun with fearless leader , but it's not nearly enough . a self-deprecating gag referring to who framed roger rabbit ? doesn't change the fact that roger's concept was made for its format , and vice-versa . rocky and bullwinkle are cartoons in a human world simply because they could be . there are more than a few decent gags in playwright kenneth lonergan's script for rocky and bullwinkle -- the title of fearless leader's perfectly awful televsion series will set me to giggling for a few days -- and a lack of bombast that makes it infinitely easier to swallow . it's also a cheerful film that's perfectly suitable for kids , even as it offers tidbits for adults . there's just something inescapably , inherently wrong about turning these characters into cgi wise-crackers who interact with whoopi goldberg , john goodman and all the other cameo actors trotted out for our knowing amusement . the adventures of rocky and bullwinkle may be close to the best live-action film that could be made with these characters , and that's not saying much . call it a draw . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
director : wolfgang petersen . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 136 minutes . the amazing thing about sebastian junger's best-selling non-fiction book the perfect storm was that it created an enthralling , page-turning story out of two less-than-pulse-pounding subjects : fishing and weather . even more surprising , perhaps , was the manner in which he chose to make those subjects readable . rather than creating a de facto novel about the people involved in the events , junger dives into journalistic detail . he immerses the reader so completely in the hard lives of swordfishermen as a culture that it's never necessary for him to over-dramatize the individual lives he's focusing on . as for the weather , he is similarly successful at creating specifics out of generalities . for junger , tension and adventure came from the simple facts . instead , he chose melodramatic twaddle . it's not an easy job wittliff has taken on , because there's no obvious through-line for junger's account to take as a screen story . the book effectively conveyed the personal and physical toll exacted by a fisherman's life , and for a while it appears that wittliff is pointing the story in the right direction . the perfect storm could have been set up as a seafaring twister , with stick figure characters wrapped in cool meteorological special effects . this film , at least , has its heart in the right place . its dialogue , however , could not be more wrong , wrong , wrong . perhaps panicked over how to make a journalistic account " engaging " for viewers , the makers of the perfect storm apparently gave bill wittliff the following instructions for writing his characters : " imagine a particularly bad romance novel with a $100 million budget . " they say things like , " there's only love ; " they say things like , " you're heading right into the mouth of the monster ! ; " for all the verisimilitude wittliff pumps into the conversations , the fishermen might as well have spent two hours growling " arrgh , matey " to one another . if not for the thrillingly staged final hour , the perfect storm might have been a total loss . as it stands , it's just on the border of worth a look . director wolfgang petersen stages the andrea gail's perilous journey with the kind of tension that finds you pulling yourself into a ball in your seat ; there's also a strangely effective scene involving a mid-air refueling attempt for a rescue helicopter thwarted by the intense winds . it's purely visceral film-making , mind you , but it's very good visceral film-making , and at least you don't have to worry about listening to the next ridiculous thing to come out of someone's mouth . it's ironic , because the perfect storm had the potential to be a powerfully human story in spite of showy visual effects and adventure set pieces . instead , it's only worth watching for its visual effects and adventure set pieces . the storm itself is perfect ; the purple prose journey towards that storm makes you long for a bit more journalistic distance . or at least for someone to fiddle with the sound mix so the wind drowned out every word . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : barry schneider & richard hawley . director : yves simoneau . hey , mr . development executive , have i got a pitch for you . now here's the casting twist : jamie lee curtis , scream queen ingenue of late 70s/early 80s horror films as the * villain * . give it a french director and some moody photography to make it look more respectable , and voila ! you've got a bona fide hit on your hands , right ? well , probably not . mother's boys occupies that unfortunate middle ground between teen scarefest and pop phenom psychothriller , inevitably limiting its audience . it also swings wildly from the subtly creepy to the just-plain-dumb . robert will have none of it , but jude is more than determined--she's sociopathic . mother's boys is one of those movies where it's easy to spend a lot of time picking apart flaws in logic , if logic is something you expect from your thrillers . i suppose it would have been too stereotypical for callie to be * just * a teacher . then there are silly details like the band-aid which is supposed to cover the cut on jude's forehead , and " cliche alert " problems like the use of not one , not two , but * three * nightmare sequences . the script is sloppy in its attempt to explain jude's pathology , and the character development is virtually non-existent . yet for all that , mother's boys still almost won me over on style points alone . from the eye-catching opening credits to the climax , director yves simoneau gives the production a smoky , dreamlike atmosphere which maintains tension throughout . the story is thankfully short on gothic excess , and i was pleasantly surprised by the twist to jude's plan . jamie lee curtis is generally well- directed , veering into the overblown only rarely . finally , it leaves kes at a point of uncertainty , a rarity in films of any kind . while it may not have done much for my brain , mother's boys did get my skin crawling . what disappointed me about mother's boys was that i thought it made the wrong choices about jude . once the choice was made to go in the latter direction , mother's boys committed itself to being a thriller , and ultimately it's not that scary . how much more interesting it would have been to watch jude turn all three boys against callie , be more subtle in her seduction of robert , or make callie want to leave . 
screenplay : david schow and john shirley . i have seen a number of reviewers falling over themselves to praise the crow , and i'm not convinced that many of them haven't been unduly influenced by the film's morbid history . i , like many , hoped that the crow would serve as a fitting epitaph to a budding star , and show that he hadn't died simply to make another schlocky action-fantasy . but sadly , that's basically what the crow is--a paper thin story supporting a lot of rain and moody lighting . all right , let's dispense with the formalities right off the top : the crow * looks * great . but there is very little the crow does visually that blade runner or batman didn't already do , and for the most part do better . proyas wheels out cliches like the cityscape on fire opening shot , the close-up of the hero's face dripping with rain , and lightning revealing something previously hidden in shadow . while the art direction and cinematography are striking , there is nothing original enough to obscure the glaring weaknesses in the rest of the film . the trouble begins with the script by david schow and john shirley , but the fact is that there's no way of knowing what changes were made as a result of lee's death . perhaps the original script didn't begin with eric and shelly already dead , giving more poignance to the story and a chance to understand what eric has lost beyond the snippets shown in flashback . what is true of eric's characterization is true of the characterizations right down the line : they're either lazy , or they just don't make sense . michael wincott does fine work as the villain , but the attempt to explain his motivation is one of the lamest in recent memory . however , i'm willing to admit that there may be only two relevant questions for most potential viewers of the crow : 1 ) is it a good action film ? the answer to #1 is , better than most ; the crow is well paced , well choreographed and is at least somewhat creative . as for #2 , it's hard to say . unlike most action stars , lee at least had english as his native language , and given time he might have become a good actor . but in the crow , he wasn't yet . and i can't help but think that if he were alive today , most critics wouldn't have bee so forgiving . 
screenplay : greg harrison . director : greg harrison . that uniquely fin-de-siecle phenomenon known as the " rave " gets its sociological moment in the sun in groove , a film that will be more effective as cultural curiosity a few years hence than it is as a story today . as the djs spin on , so do their stories and several others spin along for 86 minutes . that time is moderately well-spent as an introduction to the rave sub-culture . harrison drops in a few bits of memorable lingo ( " buying a vowel " for purchasing either acid or ecstasy ; " the nod " for the party-goer's acknowledgement of the party-thrower's success ; " baked , not fried " for one fellow's expressed preference for marijuana over hallucinogens ) to set the scene without stranding newcomers in the minutia . from the dance floor to the fruit-and-water-stocked " chill room , " groove re-creates its unique world as effectively as you could hope for . harrison then proceeds to populate that world with one unmemorable , uninvolving character after another . most of the narrative is spent on david and leyla , whose budding relationship is supposed to be the core of the film but feels like just another drug-fueled party scam . worse still is the contrived drama in the relationship between colin and harmony , which takes a " hip , " independent film sort of turn for the worse . the acting is servicable at best , the characterizations not even that . groove is composed entirely of people doing the sort of thing one sees people do at raves , played with all the energy and commitment of people playing types -- you're the uncomfortable geek , you're the dealer , you're the party princess , and so on . the issue isn't that groove meanders along in its night-in-the-life way without trying to be particularly profound . dazed and confused and american graffiti were charming studies of its era's revellers , and no one much cared if an epiphany was to be found . both of those films , however , had the benefit of a nostalgic distance , allowing both film-maker and audience to recognize the silliness inherent in youthful celebration . greg harrison is too serious about this milieu ; he seems to be making the suggestion that kids really have found party nirvana this time , not like those goofy kids of the '60s , '70s and '80s . it's no wonder the characters are irrelevant ; harrison just needed bodies to jump up and down to the beat . his take on the rave scene , detailed though it may be , isn't dazed and confused for the '90s . it's thank god it's friday for the '90s . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
watching the cell is akin to watching a demo reel for the film's art directors , makeup artists , production designer and costume designer -- which , i'm sure , it will end up being . make no mistake about it , the cell is the kind of film technical craftspeople lie awake fantasizing about . the result can be the eye-popping stuff of oscar nominations ( and wins ) , a film people walk away from thinking what all art directors , makeup artists , production designers and costume designers secretly want viewers to walk away thinking : " boy , that looked incredible . " the cell does look incredible , and since it is evident in nearly every frame that its primary purpose for existing is to look incredible , i suppose you'd have to say that it works in its own strange way . if only that look seemed less familiar , or more resonant . the procedure has yielded only the slightest success , but it becomes the best chance for f . b . i . first-time feature director tarsem singh ( director of music videos like r . e . m . 's " losing my religion " ) is clearly going for a silence of the lambs-meets-seven vibe , a commercially wise decision given the financial success of those films . there are heroes with their own demons to banish , interactions between killer and profiler , a screaming woman to be saved , some stark desert landscapes and some grisly images you'll just want to purge from your brain . the parts are right , but they're not put together in a way that adds up to anything . both deane and novak get 30-second character development moments to explain their motivations , including a provocative hint at novak's own dark childhood , while most of the film treats them like props to throw into stargher's messed-up head . considering the film takes nearly an hour to throw them there -- spending an inordinate amount of time on the police work that locates stargher , when that's not really the point of the story -- the fuzzy characterizations are eminently noticeable . singh's shots are often effectively disorienting , including one arcing shot that ends with the camera swinging upside down into water . many of the nightmare concepts ( a hideous bit of psycho-torture ) and directing tricks with which singh dresses up his film are utterly unique ; nearly as many are stuff out of intro to music video auteurs' freaky surrealist visuals . eventually , it becomes difficult to take the cell seriously , because so much of the imagery feels cribbed from 20 years of mtv . the 1984 dennis quaid fantasy dreamscape at least found some fun in walking through another person's psyche . the cell is supposed to be terrifying , but when a serial killer's mindscape resembles an s&m variation on a robert palmer video , his power to intimidate can't help but diminish . the juxtaposition of the two stories allows each protagonist the opportunity to get a big dramatic moment . unfortunately , they have nothing whatsoever to do with one another , which is yet another example of the cell's fundamentally flawed storytelling -- it takes far too long to get into its central concept , then tries to make up for that mistake by lingering there once it's already served its purpose . i didn't necessarily expect the cell to be a film that would stand up to much scrutiny . i did expect something that would provide the shock of the new . singh and his crew don't provide enough that's shockingly new to make up for the cell's lapses as a narrative . boy , the cell's visuals looked incredible . . . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
rain man was not about dustin hoffman's raymond babbitt . there are some who find the film overly sentimental , and others who consider hoffman's oscar-winning performance little more than a gimmick , but it's hard to argue that the basic structure of the story wasn't what it had to be . raymond couldn't be that character , because it's absurd to build a narrative around the idea that someone with a profound emotional/psychological condition can decide through a simple act of will to be better . this lesson is offered to explain why chuck & buck , for all the quirky things it does right , is ultimately an experience somewhere between improbable and downright insulting . there's a lot of interesting stuff built into the premise , including a not-particularly-twisty twist that still generates a bit more interest in the chuck/buck dynamic . white's performance as buck is pitched just right , somewhere between endearing and creepy in his striped t-shirt and perpetually blow-pop-stuffed grin . director miguel arteta's choice of digital video seems an ill-advised one dramatically -- why heighten the immediacy and realism of a story centered around somebody's fantasy world ? -- but the technology and hand-held movement are rarely distracting . throw in an infectiously innocuous theme song to set the tone , and you've got the raw material for some solid whacked-out drama and dark comedy . and that raw material is left to rot . but charlie is a huge sucking black hole of a characterization , left utterly bereft of personality or motivations in chris weitz's performance and white's script . he's merely a target of obsession , carelessly created because white never intends for the story to be about anything but buck . chuck & buck's resolution is centered around the idea that 15 years of juvenile infantilism are as easy to toss off as a striped t-shirt . chuck & buck's saving grace is a sub-plot that ultimately has little to do with the ostensibly main plot -- buck's attempt to mount a production of a play he has written about his childhood friendship , called hank & frank . a short film entirely about the play within the play might have been great fun , unburdened by the need for grand third-act shifts of character . chuck & buck sinks thanks to a fundamental misunderstanding of how to structure a plot with a plausible character arc . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : tom s . parker & jim jennewein and steven e . de souza . director : brian levant . i decided to try something different for the flintstones . i put aside my critical notebook and tried to clear my mind of all preconceptions : the thirty-two writers who worked on the script ; the mind-numbing marketing blitz ; the dread at the appearance of yet another tv retread . and i resolved to let it be what it would be , to tell myself , norman vincent peale-like , " i will enjoy this film on its own level . " do you know what ? it almost worked . as silly , clunky and repetitive as the flintstones may be , it's still something of a guilty pleasure , at least on a visual level . while it's no film for the ages , neither is it a modern stone-age travesty . it's tempting to call the flintstones imaginative , but there really wouldn't seem to be all that much imagination involved in directly transferring the animated series to live action . every house , every costume , even every sound effect is instantly recognizable to anyone who grew up with " the flintstones " either in first run or syndication . of course , that is the logic behind the glut of tv-based films : bring in that elusive older audience with the nostalgia/recognition factor . if my audience was any indication , it's working with the flintstones . while the kids screeched with delight at the slapstick , the biggest laugh from the adults was reserved for rosie o'donnell's pitch-perfect duplication of betty's trademark giggle . i generally found myself entertained while i took in the production design and admired its whimsical authenticity . there is , however , one major problem with the casting , and it comes as quite a surprise . physically , he pulls his punches more often than not , as though he didn't understand just how far overboard he should go in a live action cartoon ; in his delivery , he struggles with the blustering voice originated by alan reed , and appears to be re-routing it through jackie gleason ( whose " honeymooners " character ralph kramden was the model for fred flintstone ) . goodman's relatively weak fred unfortunately overshadows his solid castmates . rick moranis is an appealingly amiable barney , and rosie o'donnell , while not ideal physically as betty , had the mannerisms down pat . and it may be worth the price of admission just to see elizabeth taylor , as wilma's mother , tied up and gagged and lying on the ground . one interesting by-product came out of seeing the flintstones : i realized that i had under-appreciated the addams family films . like those films , the flintstones primarily offers as its humor variations on a single theme . but the addams outings at least seemed occasionally inspired ; the flintstones is content just to show up and toss off the expected " rock " and " stone " puns . this is especially disconcerting when a flintstones franchise may be as close to a sure thing as there is in hollywood . the first time around , the flintstones' visuals are a light-hearted kick , but there's nothing more to do . i could write that sequel given a day and a half . . . 
all right , i'm not saying people flocked to white men can't jump or indecent proposal thanks to his name above the title . nevertheless , harrelson has demonstrated an enviable talent for picking hits , even if that has been the only thing he has really demonstrated in his fledgling big screen career . the cowboy way is in for a much harder ride towards success , facing stiff summer competition , but whatever its box office take , there might be more in it for harrelson to be proud of personally than any of his previous films . given the challenge of carrying a film for the first time , he takes a tedious formula picture and singlehandedly makes it at least moderately endearing . i could easily name fifty variations on this particular theme which have graced the screen since i have been a regular movie-goer ; fish-out-of-water comedy is as venerable a genre as the western itself . the cowboy way fits every one perfectly creating that comfortable familiarity filmmakers seek much more frequently than originality . the tweaks to that formula the cowboy way incorporates run from the obvious ( the friendly cop has a romance with cowboy mythology ) to the mildly interesting ( dylan mcdermott's insecure villain ) , but let's be frank . the cowboy way does not , nor was it meant to , dazzle with its inventiveness . in fact , there are long stretches when it's a crashing bore . the showpiece here is the energetic performance of woody harrelson , who has a great deal of fun with the lovably oafish pepper . in many ways , the cowboy way plays like little more than a series of setups for pepper to do something stupid , which could have been a nightmare if so many of those stupid things weren't so funny . as long as harrelson was on the screen , the cowboy way kept me smiling . if only there was one interesting person for him to interact with . kiefer sutherland continues to show that screen presence is a recessive sutherland family trait , reading every line as though he had something on the stove that he really needed to get back to . sonny is supposed to be level-headed , but sutherland interprets " level-headed " as " comatose , " much as he did in last year's the three musketeers . the cowboy way is a tired premise filled with tired-looking actors , but woody harrelson was able to lasso me by the neck and take me along for the ride . i'd like to see a home video version where the plot is edited out entirely ; it just ends up getting in harrelson's way . 
mpaa rating : unrated ( could be pg-13 for brief nudity , profanity ) running time : 89 minutes . that , unfortunately , is what prevents barenaked in america from being a particularly interesting film experience . the ladies are presented by priestley as a group of nice , intelligent guys having loads of fun entertaining their fans , almost completely unfazed by their sudden notoriety in america . great stuff for a people magazine profile ; not so much for a feature documentary . chalk it up to bad luck , perhaps , but the time frame for priestley's profile is all wrong . start the story a few months earlier , and you may have something : a hard-working bunch of decent guys swooping back and forth between the highest highs and the lowest lows . as it actually unfolds , barenaked in america is utterly bereft of drama . which is not to say that it's utterly bereft of entertainment . even viewers who are not bnl devotees will find it hard to deny the energetic appeal of their stage shows , which turn into rowdy audience-participation improvisations . unfortunately , barenaked in america isn't a straight-ahead concert film . it's not really clear exactly what priestley wants it to be , in fact . there are token bits of archival footage , but not enough to provide a sense of where the ladies came from . there are moments of backstage and person-on-the-street cavorting , but not enough to make the film a showcase for the band members' off-stage charm . and there are token glimpses of the easy-going fellows putting their feet down on business decisions ( like their dissatisfaction with a video for their follow-up single " it's all been done " ) , but they feel completely incongruous with most of the film pitched lighter than air . occasionally priestley takes an off-beat angle , like letting both fans and detractors of the band speak their minds after hearing bnl music . far more often , he simply turns on his camera like a buddy of the band making a home movie . these guys were never going to yield a spinal tap-like story of internal meltdown and rampant ego ; it would have taken a much more skilled documentarian and a much more precise time frame to make a barenaked ladies film soar . the band itself deserves the attention , because talented pop musicians and songwriters with a zeal for showmanship are in too short supply to dismiss them as a novelty act . if anything positive comes from barenaked in america , it might be encouraging more people to know the band from its live shows . that's the barenaked experience that should be recorded for posterity . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
producers : peter abrams , robert levy and steven reuther . director : mimi leder . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , drug use , violence ) running time : 122 minutes . when i finished reading catherine ryan hyde's novel pay it forward , one simple thought occurred to me : " someone's going to have to screw up big time to keep this from being a real crowd-pleaser . " it was far from clear that pay it forward would make for a great film ; there were a lot of plot threads to condense , and a definite danger of pollyanna overkill . but there was something primally satisfying about the whole idea of it , and a kicker of a finale that was a true tear-jerker on the page . great , not necessarily ; hanky-wringing and applause-inducing , most definitely . maybe a fable like pay it forward could only have worked on the page . more likely , maybe it only could have worked with a director who knew how to tell an inherently emotional story with some degree of subtlety . his classmates scoff at his optimism , but eugene is intrigued by trevor's idea . much has been made of the fact that the kevin spacey character was african-american in the novel , but pay it forward isn't ineffective because it's not faithful enough . there are quite a few things to like about the film , from helen hunt's willingness to look positively ghastly , to the use of the las vegas setting . and of course there's kevin spacey , who can always be counted on to dazzle even when the material is less than stellar . he's a fascinating screen performer , and here he gets at the hope buried in a bitter man . that's what spacey can do even when a director seems to be working against him . leder excelled as a small screen director for " e . r . , " but in pay it forward , as in deep impact , she once again misses every opportunity to make the film about more than its concept . granted , dixon's script is better with individual moments than it is at building a narrative , but leder makes a flawed script even worse . every shot involving a human face involves a close-up so intense you can count pores ; supporting characters -- notably jon bon jovi as trevor's absentee dad -- aren't given a chance to develop beyond a single note . leder's editing choices rob the moment of all its power , including pointless cutaway's to hunt's reaction shots . every time a scene calls for finding a core of emotional honesty , leder opts instead to convey sincerity by blowing up haley joel osment's head to the size of a dirigible and letting the tears roll down his pouting face . plenty of opponents of pay it forward will probably fixate on the film's final shot , which borrows blatantly from another feel-good film that shall remain nameless . once again , the problem isn't that it differs from the novel's climax ; it isn't even that it's familiar from another film . the problem is that it's simply a movie moment , one that ignores that the payoff in pay it forward should be the success or failure of trevor's idea . it's manipulative and overwrought , but the real issue is that it's not organic to the story . leder spends two hours grasping for how to tell this story visually , and almost never comes up with the appropriate choice . pay it forward is still bound to leave some viewers thinking they've seen a good film , just because it leaves them a little teary-eyed . i doubt many of them will feel any resonance from those tears 24 hours later . you managed to screw it up big time . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
director : uli edel . mpaa rating : pg ( adult themes , mild profanity , violence ) running time : 95 minutes . the little vampire falls squarely in the center of the " family film " continuum -- a place few family films tend to occupy . on one end , we find those films that appeal to viewers of all ages with imagination and a lack of pandering ( toy story , e . t . , beauty and the beast ) . on the other end , we find those films that appeal either to marketing concerns ( pokemon , mighty morphin power rangers ) or toilet humor ( most live-action disney films of the last decade ) . true mediocrity in family filmmaking is quite a rarity , which makes the little vampire an intriguing pop culture curiosity : it's a simple and whimsical tale that keeps flirting with inappropriateness . like the protagonists in e . t . , and/or " cool ! " jim carter , in his tex cobb-circa-raising arizona wardrobe , makes for a good nasty-comic villain , and the script ( co-written by chicken run and james and the giant peach scribe karey kirkpatrick ) includes at least a few clever lines like , " it's not easy for a father to hear , but your son is a blood-sucking fiend . " much of it is silly , but there's also a dark side that many of the better children's tales have always had . there's also a perplexing dose of questionable content . you see , anna is a 307-year-old in a 7-year-old's body , making her advances slightly more sophisticated than giggles and goo-goo eyes . in fact , in one scene she sits on tony's bed and -- in her best lauren bacall come-hither tones -- asks tony , " you know how to whistle , don't you ? " though it's likely to go right over the heads of the very young , there's something icky about using a lascivious pre-pubescent as a punch line -- even ickier than the giant pasture patty dropped from the sky by a flying vampire cow during the film's " far side " -meets-john hughes climax . it's not terribly surprising to find the little vampire straying from the kid-friendly straight-and-narrow , considering it was directed by uli edel , the man behind such innocent entertainments as last exit to brooklyn and madonna's 1993 sex stinker body of evidence . edel's pacing is fairly sluggish for a children's film , and the rest of it is a bit too bland for parents to get excited about . yet there's still some fun adventure here , and it's not all designed to get its viewers to buy action figures . it's hard to know quite how enthusiastic to be about a family film that's occasionally pitched at the wrong crowd , but at least isn't stupid or actively offensive most of the time . and that , unfortunately , is a sad statement on " family " filmmaking in 2000 : simple mediocrity is starting to look pretty good . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : jeremy leven , based on the novel by steven pressfield . director : robert redford . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , wartime violence ) running time : 125 minutes . philosophy generally makes for godawful cinema . steven pressfield's novel the legend of bagger vance seemed like a terribly unlikely candidate for a film translation , because it wasn't really a novel . combined with a mash note to the game of golf , wrapped loosely around a period narrative . there was no way pressfield's book could be turned into an engaging film . then again , that's what people said about norman maclean's a river runs through it , and somehow director robert redford managed to turn that book into a pretty solid film . but how would a text comprised primarily of mystical lessons and play-by-play from the links be rendered on screen ? redford's adaptation of the legend of bagger vance radically re-imagines pressfield's novel to make it a more palatable screen story . in so doing , he rips out its soul and leaves a fairly bland sports drama in its place . it's easy to see the logic behind most of screenwriter jeremy leven's decisions in adapting bagger vance . the story is streamlined into a tale of redemption and lost love regained , and the climax is rendered as a nigh-mythical clash of titans . it's all quite clean and efficient , with all the prosaic descriptions of transcendentally significant dogleg lefts and most of the revelatory visions left on the page . in fact , it's so clean and efficient that it hardly registers as a drama at all . while pressfield's novel wasn't terribly concerned with making his characters genuinely complex , it didn't really matter contextually . leven and redford don't add much to that complexity , and here it matters a lot . redford is too concerned with making the atmosphere mystical to give junuh's pain an earthly urgency , and matt damon's performance suffers as a result . charlize theron gets to weep a bit , but adele has " romantic interest " written all over her from the outset . will smith does fine , relaxed work as bagger , but his importance as a spiritual teacher is diminished with his teachings reduced to fortune cookie-sized aphorisms . bagger vance was not going to work on the screen with twenty minute sermons on the authentic swing ; it makes perfect sense to shift the focus to the characters . it makes no sense to shift the focus , then still leave the characters underdeveloped . as usual , redford directs a technically accomplished piece of work , beautifully photographed by michael ballhaus and smoothly edited . there's simply no weight to any of it , despite the intrusively heavy score by rachel portman . instead of a meditation on a personal journey to enlightenment told through the unique nature of the game of golf , the film becomes a period piece with a few appealing performances . what remains is a film about whether or not junuh will win the big golf match and/or win the girl . and while it's competently rendered , it's not exactly the matter of cosmic import the film builds it up to be . you can't blame a filmmaker for radically altering a text as inherently uncinematic as the legend of bagger vance . redford , however , alters it to the point that you wonder why he bothered to make it at all . he understood that philosophy generally makes for godawful cinema . he didn't understand that without the philosophy , or rich characterizations to replace it , the legend of bagger vance just barely breaks par . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : greg berlanti . director : greg berlanti . the helpful sub-title tagged on to the broken hearts club is not the only time you'll be instructed exactly what you're supposed to understand about the film . it's more than a movie , it's an anthropology class . welcome to " intro to gay 101 . " the broken hearts club clearly has its broken heart in the right place , but it's too concerned with making statements about its milieu to let the narrative work organically as a character study . and there are lots of characters to study in this ensemble dramedy . that's a whole heap of humanity to which berlanti must be attentive , and he's not quite up to the task . most of his characters remain types throughout , particularly the more effeminate benji and taylor . the rest of the actors just don't have enough to work with . in 94 minutes , the broken hearts club just can't support a half-dozen major characters . it's a shame , too , because berlanti actually has an intriguing concept at the core of his film . unlike most gay-themed films , this one isn't about coming out , or dealing with the straight world , or aids . it's a fairly risky statement about the complications when members of a minority group become so insular that their entire frame of reference becomes their other-ness . this is a film that's ready to acknowledge that sometimes gay men -- even after they've said , " we're here , we're queer " -- haven't quite gotten used to it . an idea , unfortunately , isn't enough to sustain a film . there is plenty of tart dialogue , and not all of it is of the bitchy-queen variety . the individual moments of humor and discovery are nice , but they don't add up to enough . the broken hearts club is a movie determined to teach you something , rather than a movie about people whose experiences teach you something . a lecture with romance and comedy is still a lecture . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
i thought to myself . it was not for want of action that i questioned the lineage of true lies ; indeed , cameron continues to define the state of the art in the genre . but was this the same man who created some of the strongest female characters in recent memory , producing such a mean-spirited and misogynist throwback to the glory days of james bond ? although parts of true lies work extremely well , its long detour into an unnecessary and unpleasant sub-plot left me with a very bad taste in my mouth . i compared true lies to the james bond films , and those comparisons are both for good and bad . not that it's a problem ; the scene is sharply executed , and complemented by the surprisingly entertaining supporting work of tom arnold as harry's partner gib . however , it holds out promise for a witty film based on action set pieces , and that's not exactly what develops . instead , true lies takes a sharp left turn into farce , and for nearly half an hour becomes an entirely different film . for all its flash and star power , this segment of true lies plays like little more than a $100 million episode of " three's company . " but it's not just that it is contrived and interrupts the flow of the film . it also features harry treating his wife with an astonishing level of mental cruelty , and it's all played for laughs . with another , more plain-looking actor , this treatment might have come off as more light-hearted . schwarzenegger , however , simply looks too angry , and scenes like harry's interrogation of helen which had most of the audience howling with delight had me literally cringing . the spectacular final hour of true lies is almost enough to tip the balance back in its favor . the digital effects which enhance a harrier jet assault on a miami highrise are spectacular , and the pyrotechnics are dynamic . but i could never lose myself in true lies because of the jarring shifts between broad comedy and big action . it may be a funnier , more technically proficient film than hudson hawk , but it belongs in the same genre : the multi-million dollar caper . for many viewers , all that will matter is that arnold fires of a couple hundred thousand rounds , a bridge blows up , and there are some solid laughs . for me , a film like true lies could only work with a lighter touch and considerably less of a nasty edge . with cameron delivering so many of his jokes through clenched teeth , i found true lies depressing almost as often as i found it fun . 
mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 117 minutes . and then the movie ends . thornton and miramax feuded for a year over the length of the film , with the director originally turning in a two-and-a-half hour cut before finally paring it down to under two hours . the resulting film is the best evidence that thornton was right . all the pretty horses is a film that wants to achieve an epic scope , but where plot points keep rolling by so quickly that there's no time for anything to resonate . it's a picturesque travelogue made for short attention span theatre . and the complications progress from there . one of the most impressive elements of cormac mccarthy's novel was how he was able to take such a plot-heavy story and make it feel rich and profound . ted tally's script retains the laconic cowboy dialogue , but the structure is a mess . the set-up concerning john grady's fragmented family is dispatched in a few snippets of film and some voice-over , providing little foundation for the journey that is to come . in some earlier incarnation , tally may have provided more fleshing out for the individual story elements , more gradual build-up for the drama . in the two hours all the pretty horses now takes on screen , there's a sense in virtually every scene that someone was standing over the editor's shoulder , tapping his watch and muttering , " come on , we gotta get to the skinny-dipping come on , we gotta get to the knife fight . " the really unfortunate part is that you can see a quality film screaming to get loose . thomas is also solid , and lucas black grabs the screen in his smaller role as the high-strung blevins . it's easy to understand what the film-makers are reaching for in their exploration of a changing country and the disappearance of a slower , simpler way of life . it's far more difficult to get caught up in those themes while trying to keep up with the latest dramatic development in john grady's life . ordinarily , it might be worth commending all the pretty horses for not arbitrarily turning the romantic sub-plot into the entire focus of the film ( though it's still the entire focus of the ad campaign ) . this isn't really a story about john grady doin' the hoochie-coochie with his little senorita , and while penelope cruz is quite scrumptious to look at , she doesn't exactly create a complex character . it's a bit of a surprise when the film moves along for another twenty minutes or so of loose-end-tying after the love story has been resolved , but in this case , it doesn't feel like a daring or unconventional choice . it simply feels like another example of a film that's almost never in the moment , so desperate to dash off that you suspect the whole crew was renting its equipment by the minute . so much for a celebration of a slower , simpler way of life . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : steve martin . director : gillies mackinnon . his script for roxanne retained only the most basic plot elements , while ditching the tragedy . with a simple twist of fate , he has been perhaps too faithful , letting a deliberate exposition and somber tone dull a potentially appealing redemption tale . there is something jarring about watching a film constructed like a 19th century novel set in the present day . a simple twist of fate takes its own sweet time establishing its plot and characters , and for the first half hour it seems muted to the point of inaudibility , and very dark in its tone . but curiously , the one thing missing from this overlong first act is any sense of who michael mccann really is . he is viewed mostly through the reactions of townspeople , or filmed in shadow hoarding his precious gold coins . i felt that i knew more about characters like newland's wayward brother ( stephen baldwin ) than the man whose transformation is to provide the centerpiece for the film . to be fair to steve martin the screenwriter , steve martin the actor may not have been the best choice for this role . for the past couple of years , in such films as leap of faith , martin has been trying to establish himself as a legitimate dramatic actor , and while he is always an appealing presence , he just doesn't look comfortable in scenes which require serious emotion . his standard " repressed emotion " take is on frequent display in a simple twist of fate , and it usually just makes him look slightly constipated . at those moments , i just couldn't lose myself in the pre-mathilda mccann . there is much more to enjoy in the second act of simple twist . martin is very good as the nervous novice father , and his scenes with the various child actors playing mathilda are generally quite charming . also appealing are the performances of catherine o'hara as a quirky antique shop owner who befriends mccann ( and , in a pleasant surprise , * doesn't * become his romantic interest ) , and gabriel byrne , slipping in and out of a virginia accent but providing some nice shading for a part that could have been a stock villain . unfortunately , the conclusion of a simple twist of fate becomes a predictable and overlong custody battle , complete with courtroom scenes and a hissable lawyer . the more melodramatic a simple twist of fate became--and ironically , the more like its source material-- the less effective it was as a film . as nicely as the bonding between father and daughter was portrayed , it couldn't compensate for the plodding story on either end of it . 
screenplay : mark verheiden . director : peter hyams . a muscular action hero with a thick accent stars in a science fiction film about traveling into the past to change the future . no , i'm not talking about the terminator , although i suspect the similarity is more than coincidental . jean-claude van damme has labored through several virtually indistinguishable testosterone fests without discovering his breakout hit , so timecop must have seemed like the perfect opportunity . and it will probably do what it was intended to do , expanding van damme's audience the way the terminator expanded arnold schwarzenegger's . it's an energetic film that doesn't skimp on the action , but it suffers from an over-convoluted storyline that pushes the logic meter * way * into the red zone . however , those are not the issues which hamper timecop most . there is more fundamental foolishness , like what exactly the t . e . c . either there has been an inordinate number of rogue timecops , or there was a spectacular level of stupidity involved in not destroying the other machine . one also wonders why assassins from the future can't be slightly less obtrusive than extras from the road warrior . while reuben is good working with sketchy material , the character appears too late and disappears too soon to leave any kind of impact on the story . everything about the fielding character feels contrived , sloppy and , worst of all , completely unnecessary . director peter hyams went a little nuts in the editing room , making some of van damme's fight scenes look like they were lit with a strobe , but they are mostly creative and well- choreographed ; only the final showdown drags on a bit . the special effects are sharp , and the computer-generated snap-back look to the characters' movements through time is inventive and well-handled . the production values are generally impressive , and action fans will not be too disappointed . the real pleasant surprise of timecop turns out to be the acting of jean-claude van damme . yes , that's right , i said acting . though still sometimes difficult to understand through his belgian accent , van damme is an appealing performer who looks comfortable on screen , something steven seagal has yet to accomplish . timecop isn't exactly a demanding film for an actor , but van damme shows that he can provide texture , something a bit more substantive than roundhouse kicks . he also gets to work off a suitably nasty villain in ron silver , who is perfectly cast , and has a nice chemistry with the too-little-seen mia sara . it's too bad timecop often feels bloated and preposterous , because there's a bit of heart lurking beneath the hardware . it's just a bit too uneven to take advantage of its strengths . 
screenplay : denis o'neil . meryl streep has proved to be an actor impossible to pigeonhole . now streep has gotten serious again , but this time in the context of an action-suspense thriller . the river wild gives streep the chance to flex new muscles ( literally and artistically ) , and while she continues to be one of the most talented actors alive , she is failed here by a script which is thoroughly by-the-numbers . there is something to be said simply for the opportunity to watch meryl streep perform . she manages to convey not only her anger at wade for threatening her family , but a subtle seduction in the attempt to convince him and a genuine frustration that she isn't good enough to make this journey even if she wanted to . it was because of scenes like that that my attention never completely wandered as long as streep was on the screen , and she is almost always on the screen . the problem is that most of the elements surrounding her aren't one-tenth as interesting . denis o'neil's script goes exactly where you expect it to go exactly when you expect it to go there , a story any movie of the week could come up with . strathairn is solid , but has little to do ; kevin bacon has a lot to do , and does most of it poorly . he's too stupid and not crazy enough when he needs to be most threatening , and there's not all that much conflict involved when the only thing the villain has over the protagonists is a gun . director curtis hanson directs in a workmanlike manner , trotting out such suspense film standbys as the old " pet leaps out to the accompaniment of a blast of music " trick . it frequently seems as though he sees the family conflict storyline as something in the way , something to be pushed through to get to the rafting sequences . to be fair , those sequences are exciting . cinematographer robert elswit's camera swoops and dives , and there is a genuine sense of danger . the location scenery is also magnificent , filmed on rivers in oregon and montana , and helps fill in many of the dead spots . but the river wild is too often the river mild , a mediocre melodrama gifted with the presence of one great actor . 
starring : robert deniro , kenneth branagh , helena bonham carter . screenplay : steph lady and frank darabont . director : kenneth branagh . in the first place , this is * not * mary shelley's frankenstein . as iconic and thematically fascinating as shelley's novel might be , it is unfilmable as written , a rambling piece more notable for long philosophical musings than for any action one would consider cinematically ideal . no , while this version may be more faithful than most , it is really kenneth branagh's frankenstein , and therein lies its crucial failing . while ostensibly attempting to stay close to shelley's often tedious narrative , branagh is more frequently indulging his bombastic filmmaking style , giving us the gee-whiz camera work of dead again without any of that film's sense of fun . there are a truckload of bad decisions involved in mary shelley's frankenstein , but the most glaring might be branagh casting himself as the good mad doctor . as talented a shakespearean stage actor as he is , he is also a shakespearean stage actor on film . victor frankenstein is a character defined by torment , but branagh's version of torment often consists of howling and tearing at his hair . the screenplay by steph lady and frank darabont does far too little to establish the oedipal subtext which is the basis for frankenstein's obsession , making branagh's reaction to his mother's death look comically overboard . when nearly a full hour goes by before the creature plays a significant role , frankenstein's characterization needs to be developed more consistently and subtly , and branagh can't pull it off . he also seems to direct that first hour without any thought of the audience . it's true that he's dealing with a script that leap-frogs over twenty years in the first ten minutes , but branagh's editing choices are baffling . the opening sequence , which takes place on a ship in the arctic , is so loud and fast that it borders on the incoherent ; the next twenty minutes are a crashing bore . frankenstein always looks impressive , particularly the mammoth stairway of the frankenstein manor which seems to take on a life of its own , but until the creation sequence branagh spends an awful lot of time doing precious little but creating atmosphere as precociously as possible . the creation sequence does signal a significant improvement in frankenstein , and that is largely due to the surprisingly expressive performance of robert deniro as the creature . even under mounds of gruesome latex , deniro gives the creature an interior life , and some of the scenes which focus on his interaction with a peasant family are extremely touching . but he is frequently failed by branagh's direction , because branagh doesn't want to concentrate on the story's philosophical underpinnings--he wants to film an opera . there are moments of undeniable power in mary shelley's frankenstein , including a horrifying sequence involving the creation of a bride for the creature , and they are so strong that they almost make up for the flotsam between them . unfortunately , for the most part frankenstein the movie ends up a lot like the creature itself : alternately lumbering and chaotic , and a patchwork mess . 
screenplay : anne rice . and both were the subject of intense pre-release scrutiny as a result of off-beat casting decisions . however , the most relevant--and unfortunate--similarity between the two is what ends up on the screen . interview with the vampire is a spectacularly executed production , perhaps more consistent in its tone than frankenstein , but it also lacks that film's high points ; it's simply too plot-heavy , and ends up feeling extremely rushed . first , to the single most pressing question to anyone familiar with anne rice's novel : is tom cruise an acceptable lestat ? the answer is , sometimes . there are moments , and not isolated ones , where cruise is positively fiendish , more so than one could have any right to hope . he has said in interviews that he grew to hate playing the depressive vampire , and that fact is sadly evident in his performance , a dazed and lackluster turn . she becomes the tortured soul whose plight truly connects with the audience in a way that louis's should have , but never does . of course , this is one of the dangers inherent in doing a big hollywood adaptation of what is essentially an interior monologue . director neil jordan has filmed the story beautifully , busing philippe rousselot's cinematography to perfection , and scenes like the theater of vampires production are nearly ideal translations from the novel . the production design is magnificent , and elliot goldenthal's score is a great mood setter . it looks so good that occasionally i could overlook the fact that in their rush to pack as much plot as possible into two hours , jordan and rice had severely skimped on their characters' motivations . this is not to say that there haven't been some significant improvements made from the novel , particularly adding some much-needed black humor . but for interview with the vampire to work as anything besides simply spectacle , louis had to becomes something besides a pouting immortal , and lestat had to be something more than a sporadically zany eternal adolescent . interview with the vampire ends up positively gorgeous , and extremely hollow . 
director : michael apted . screenplay : william nicholson and mark handley . the pre-release buzz over jodie foster's performance in nell tells you two things about this year's academy awards race . first , it's another abysmal year for female leading roles when people can't think of any worthy nominees and start to hype a performance two months before anyone has seen it . second , it's another year when overcoming a disability is virtually the express lane to a nomination . what it doesn't tell you is how good foster actually is in nell , and that is simply good , and far from great . nell as a whole is even less successful , a well-acted but unremarkable film which makes a couple of profound missteps . director michael apted has demonstrated an affinity for films set in the south ( coal miner's daughter ) and films about culture clashes ( thunderheart ) , so he would seem like a good fit for nell . indeed , he is mostly on target . he and cinematographer dante spinotti ( who collaborated on the visually imaginative blink earlier this year ) create some marvelous images of the beautiful locations , in clear deep blues , and there are a few extremely effective scenes of nell reacting to a strange new world . however , he makes at least one truly awful choice . the problem with nell is deeper than that one error , however . thematically , it's simply the elephant man in a log cabin : " civilized people " discover " freak " and learn that " freak " is more human than any of the " civilized people . " unfortunately , nell is not nearly as subtle or engrossing as the elephant man . the script , by william ( shadowlands ) nicholson and mark handley from handley's own play , would have been better as a mystery than as the morality play it becomes , but apted's one false move robs it of that mystery . by the time we get to the climactic scene in which nell delivers the kind of courtroom speech which makes courtroom scenes so generally annoying in contemporary films , she has become too much the noble savage and not nearly human enough . jodie foster is a wonderful actress , but there's really only so much she can do with this part . though it seems tailor-made for a heap of awards , nell surprisingly fails to generate much emotional resonance . physically , foster does som superb acting ; she lets this character inhabit her entire body . it just often seems as though she is concentrating so hard on her part that she's not making connections with the other actors . liam neeson and natasha richardson are both solid as the feuding doctors , but they come to parts which have the kind of pre-fabricated back stories that come out in tearful speeches , a frequent flaw of playwrights turned screenwriters . their relationship feels contrived , which is a true shame considering neeson and richardson's real-life romance . that development is like a lot of nell : awkward , even as it looks great . 
though poetic justice was a misfire , boyz showed that singleton could tell a story , and after nearly ten years around stanford , one of the nation's hotbeds of multicultural experimentation , i knew that there were many stories to tell . higher learning shows that singleton recognized that fact as well ; unfortunately , he tried to tell them all in one movie . it's an ambitious but unfocused effort which is admirable for its balanced perspective but leaves critical characters as mere representations of the stereotypes it seems to be challenging . for fully half of its running time , higher learning appears to be headed in the right direction . unlike contemporaries oliver stone and spike lee , singleton does know how to present challenging and controversial subject matter without shouting at the top of his lungs in every frame . in a stone film , the hero's two mentors would be manifestations of good and evil ; singleton , on the other hand , makes both fudge and professor phipps smart and sensible characters , leaving the audience to draw its own conclusions . it doesn't hurt that both roles are played by magnetic screen presences . ice cube has true star potential , a powerful personality and a fine actor , and he keeps fudge from being simply a spouter of dogma . laurence fishburne's phipps doesn't really need a west indian accent , but he shows a genuine concern for malik , and also keeps his speeches from sounding didactic . malik's storyline is the most carefully plotted , and omar epps' fine performance as the young man weighing two views of being black in america makes it the most interesting to watch . but singleton fails to give his other two principles the same kind of depth . his story could have been an opportunity to examine why real , intelligent young people feel so threatened in a multi-cultural society , but he's pushed so far to the fringe that he becomes a cartoon . the problems with those two characters are representative of what is most wrong with higher learning , particularly in its second half . higher learning is awash in good intentions , but too often it's terribly simplistic , taking a story which should have been about the shaping of minds and reducing it to a matter of who's got the guns . 
screenplay : rafael yglesias and ariel dorfman . director : roman polanski . one of 1994's most unintentionally hilarious films was the adaptation of isabel allende's the house of the spirits , a bloated epic in which jeremy irons , meryl streep , glenn close and winona ryder were supposed to be playing latin americans . it baffled me that such casting could take place in an age where an anglo playing any other race would incite riots , and the casting of spirits was ultimately much of its undoing . roman polanski has made the same choice with death and the maiden , and again it was a very bad one . while as a concept death and the maiden is strong and intriguing enough to maintain interest , it is sabotaged by actors who often appear not to have the faintest idea what to do with the material . the psychological underpinnings of death and the maiden are a complex set of relationships and interactions which make for an extremely promising story . at its heart is paulina's conviction in miranda's guilt , a conviction which we should always doubt because of her paranoia and unreliability . unfortunately , as it plays out , the performances and direction make our choice far too easy for us . sigourney weaver is part of the problem , playing paulina not just over the top ( which is probably where the role should be ) but so far over the top that she falls off the top . weaver as a personality simply seems too strong to be so close to complete breakdown , so she makes up for it by contorting her face and snarling . he plays miranda as such a little weasel that if he's not guilty of this particular crime , we figure he must be guilty of _something_ . the part requires more ambiguity , and the very talented kingsley just doesn't deliver in this case . perhaps even more disappointing is the relationship between paulina and gerardo , which is remarkably intricate . all this is in the text , but somehow director roman polanski doesn't let it out . paulina never seems to love gerardo , while gerardo is mostly befuddled . the moments when they do reveal themselves , all in very stagy speeches , ring hollow because the same truths should have been evident in the performances . one scene shows what might have been , late in the film when kingsley makes a confession . polanski holds a very long take on kingsley , refusing to cut to weaver's reaction , and at that moment you genuinely wonder whether this is a guilty man spilling his guts or an innocent man giving the performance of a lifetime to save his skin . but moments later , polanski cops out with a too-obvious resolution . the performances in death and the maiden should have created a mystery . instead , the mystery is why they couldn't make the material work . 
honestly , if i never see another courtroom scene in a movie , it will be too soon . as soon as i see a witness stand , a couple of guys in suits , and twelve good persons and true , i know i'm in for nothing less than a good old-fashioned lecture . it's jello drama : ready instantly , but usually without much texture . murder in the first has an inherently interesting story at its core , but its makers don't know what to do with it except dress it up in cliches and impress us with cinematographic gymnastics . it's not a bad film ; it's just lazy , a classic example of a writer and director failing to make the most of an idea's potential . murder in the first opens with a risky but effective sequence which shows henri's treatment while in the " dungeon . " the sequence goes on for several minutes , but it is necessary considering how much henri's state of mind comes into play . in fact , director marc rocco doesn't really go far enough . the torture sequences are too romanticized , filmed in slow-motion and backlit like an s&m version of flashdance , when it would have been more appropriate to play the scenes straight so that henri's plight seemed more real . it is a lack of restraint typical of rocco's direction , which looks like he put cinematographer fred murphy in a gyroscope and just set him spinning . you get the impression that rocco thinks this story is basically about crane shots and funky angles . what it should have been about , first and foremost , is the relationship between henri and stamphill , but again rocco and screenwriter dan gordon don't take advantage of opportunities . it's too much a case of the tail wagging the dog , such that by the end of murder in the first i didn't feel the friendship between these two men which should have created its greatest emotional impact . that said , the scenes between bacon and slater are the best thing about murder in the first . though bacon's performance is occasionally indulgent , coming off like renfield with a midwestern twang , he is mostly extremely affecting . it is by far the meatiest role he has had , and he is effective at maintaining the shred of humanity behind henri's glassy stare . one scene in particular , in which slater compares the punishment he received for stealing five dollars to henri's , is a great piece of work because rocco lets the inherent power of the moment work . murder in the first , which should have been most about a connection between two very different men , instead becomes a shouting match , and by trying to make his film important with a capital " i , " marc rocco instead makes it mediocre with a capital " m . " 
the line between homage and cinematic plagiarism can be a fairly fine one , and largely a matter of perception . then there are directors who quote so frequently and so freely from their idols that it becomes an exercise in supreme critical generosity not to say that the sincerest form of flattery has become a faded photocopy of a great work of art . this week's winner of the brian depalma memorial award for stylistic cannibalism is david frankel , whose miami rhapsody , though frequently amusing , is such a blatant and second-rate ersatz woody allen film that it might as well have been called miami hall . all these revelations force gwyn to consider whether the compromises necessary in marriage are worth it all . frankel has crafted a fairly simple story on which to hang his witty observations about modern marriage , and has created an interesting character to act as tour guide . gwyn is a smart and funny woman , but an overthinker who uses her cutting remarks to keep people at a distance . sarah jessica parker is an extremely appealing actress , and she is full of energy and sparkle in this role . her character is so obviously a gender-transferred version of woody allen's compulsively self-analytical intellectual that every word out of her mouth seems just horribly wrong , or a really misguided impression . i kept waiting for parker to put on a pair of horn-rims and be done with it . if only that were the only thing frankel cribs from allen . miami rhapsody opens with a jazz score over credits on a black screen , with cast listings in alphabetical order . sound familiar ? it should if you've seen any woody allen film in the last fifteen years . there are several lines and concepts taken whole cloth from annie hall : a reference to the fact that " love fades ; " gwyn's final comments on relationships which are remarkably similar to woody allen's " we need the eggs " rationalization at the end of annie hall ; even an oblique reference to the original title of annie hall ( anhedonia , or aversion to pleasure ) in gwyn's line , " i'm just terrified of anything good that might happen to me . " with every sardonic quip and every recognizable setup , miami rhapsody began to feel more and more forced and artificial , like some film school project to cram as many woody allen references as possible into 95 minutes . there are far worse models for making a film than woody allen , and frankel fires off so many jokes that several of them invariably hit . but while frankel is adept at writing one-liners for his characters , he doesn't really know how to place them in interesting or memorable situations . miami rhapsody is not without its moments , and i laughed more than a few times . if i * really * want to laugh , i'll watch the original . 
something happens when innovative , independent directors " go hollywood , " and it's not usually a good something . some directors are ready-made for the pressures and compromises involved in working with big stars and big budgets ; others are so clearly out of their element that you can see them straining against the strictures of studio projects . sam raimi , director of the goofy and off-beat evil dead films , was hand-picked by sharon stone to helm the quick and the dead , and it looks like he had some interesting ideas about how to turn it inot a cock-eyed parody of spaghetti westerns . instead , it's not played with enough of a wink , and it becomes an extremely repetitive story muddled by tone shifts and unnecessary sub-plots . a few of the early gunfights are handled with typical raimi panache , including liberal use of the trackback/zoom in camera movement utilized by hitchcock and spielberg most notably . everywhere there are glimpses of raimi's twisted sense of humor , nowhere more so than in a gunfight which ends with the loser staring down at his shadow and noticing a hole in it . but that's all we get in the quick and the dead -- glimpses . where raimi wants self-awareness , screenwriter simon moore delivers a fairly standard western revenge saga . the story has potential , and particularly when a flashback reveals the source of ellen's grief there is evidence of some compelling psychological background . the relationship between cort and herod might have been exploited better , but for the most part cort is playing a part culled entirely from eastwood's penitent gunslingers in pale rider and unforgiven . and this is the real knock on the quick and the dead : without a real focus on raimi's satirical sensibilities and acrobatic camera tricks , it's just a less-than-mediocre knock-off of eastwood's oeuvre . gene hackman is a marvelous villain , oozing despicable charm , but his presence only magnifies the comparisons to unforgiven , and when he exposes a boastful gunman ( lance henriksen ) as a fraud , it sounds exactly like his debunking of english bob's self-aggrandizing tales in that earlier film . sharon stone is surprisingly effective as the haunted vengeance-seeker , but ultimately she too is lost in a story that doesn't really seem to have a sense of purpose . the quick and the dead boasts some fine cinematography by dante spinotti and a wonderfully dilapidated production design , and they could have been used in the service of a nice piece of parody . unfortunately , raimi couldn't or wouldn't let the throttle out , and the quick and the dead stalls when it's played far too straight . 
screenplay : jimmy mcgovern . director : antonia bird . to tell you far more about myself than you ever really wanted to know , i am what is known in the parlance as a lapsed catholic . why would i make that information known ? it certainly wouldn't be to promote the perception of objectivity in my evaluation of priest ; one might believe that i was inclined to look favorably on a film so roundly condemned by the catholic church sight unseen . such is not the case . i explain that i am a lapsed catholic because the themes in priest are extremely familiar to me , and i believe that there is a story in those themes which would make a fine film . priest could have been a compelling character study which respected the complexity of modern catholicism , but instead it is , in its own way , just as dogmatic as it accuses the church of being . for much of the film , powerful acting and an intriguing character keep priest on the right track . it is the kind of selective observation of catholic dogma which is common among comtemporary catholics , and evidence of a skewed set of priorities . unfortunately , what begins as a measured examination of religious hypocrisies turns into a kind of tirade . not only does the film become pedantic at this point , it simply becomes dull , and crawls toward its emotional climax . the flawed but human characters whose conflicts seem real become little more than mouthpieces . perhaps it is most difficult to digest the message of priest because it makes so little effort to treat the opposing point of view with any respect . whether or not the catholic church is deserving of criticism is not even the point . this is an examination of doctrinal morality as oliver stone might have done it , too full of homilies and too lacking in an understanding that issues are usually shades of grey . there are probably father gregs and father matthews in many parishes around the world , and that is an issue deserving of attention . 
you might not be surprised to find such a scene in a movie like the cure , but you probably would be surprised to find it only twenty minutes into the film . while it is exceptionally well-acted , the cure rambles on for far too long without a sense of purpose , like an attempt to stretch an " afterschool special " into a feature film . to the cure's credit , the most important thing about it , the relationship between erik and dexter , is also the best thing about it . brad renfro , who made an impressive debut in the client , has the more dynamic role of erik , the cocky inveterate liar . their rapport is genuine and very touching , and complemented by the fine supporting work of diana scarwid and annabella sciorra as their mothers . what sabotages the emotional impact of their friendship is the cure's clumsy and episodic story arc . there is nothing to do with them but send them off on a series of adventures , some of which are mildly interesting but don't really have a dramatic purpose . while erik and dexter are well-acted and sympathetic characters , at a certain point it becomes clear that all we are really going to be doing for the rest of the cure's running time is waiting for dexter to die . and what a wait it is . it seems as though screenwriter robert kuhn had an idea for a drama about aids and a drama about two friends on a journey , but neither one was long enough independently to turn into a feature . it's a shame , because director peter horton ( tv's " thirtysomething " ) has a deft touch with much of the film's potentially pathos-inducing material . but when you're playing the aids card , you had better have a really strong hand . the cure has one solid pair of aces , and a lot of spaces . 
starring : hugh grant , colm meaney , tara fitzgerald , ian mcneice , kenneth griffith . screenplay/director : christopher monger . if it had not been for jim carrey , hugh grant might have been hailed as * the * breakout star of 1994 . the englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain might have faced a monumental marketing challenge , or at least a name change , if not for the advantage of being hugh grant's first post-weddings effort . unfortunately , it's no honeymoon . grant's fans could be massively disappointed , both by his relatively minor role and by the film's frequently tedious pace . the story , based on a tale from the family of welsh writer/ director christopher monger , begins as a promising enough fable about fish out of water and a legendary act of combined community will . monger does a nice job of establishing the scene , introducing the quirks of the characters in the matter-of-fact manner of an accomplished tale-teller who relates a story he knows to be fanciful with utmost earnestness . the clash of personalities between the merrily profane morgan " the goat " and the ever-apoplectic reverend jones is entertaining , thanks largely to a good-natured performance by colm meaney , and stephen endelman provides a bright and lilting score which keeps the tone light . sadly , although it is clear that monger has a great affection for this particular story , it isn't nearly as interesting as he seems to think it is , at least not for 100 minutes . the key problem is that as much as he tries to convey why this " mountain " is so important to the people of ffynnon garw , he never quite manages to do so . he toys both with the idea of welsh identity being tied to the mountains , and with the general sense of loss brought on by the first world war , but as hard as he tries to draw us into the imperative of the ffynnon garw mission , he can't make it matter as much to the audience . while the efforts of the townspeople to thward anson and garrad in their every attempt to leave are sometimes amusing , there is a lot of space between them , and the englishman slows down to become a sporadically whimsical bore . it also appears that the presence of hugh grant resulted in an ill-advised restructuring of the script . the story really should have been about the welsh townsfolk , not about the two englishman , and indeed hugh grant is little more than a peripheral figure for fully half of the film . grant really just walks through this part , relying on his crinkly smile and hesitating delivery and little else . if the story had to focus on one of the englishman , it should have been garrad , played with puffed-up impatience by ian mcneice . of course , mcneice is only an actor ; hugh grant is a movie star . the englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain has some charms , and an appealing sense of place . it is also a case of an hour's worth of story stretched an extra forty minutes , and of a big name star in an essentially supporting role who becomes a tail wagging the dog . 
screenplay : melvin van peebles . director : mario van peebles . i have often said that the first responsibility of a historically based film is not necessarily to be good history , but to be good drama . documented facts can sometimes make for a compelling story on their own , but usually a bit of creative license is not merely acceptable , it's required . so how can i say that out of one side of my mouth , while with the other i criticize panther for being a mediocre account of the rise of the black panther party ? because by painting the characters in a far too positive light , the filmmakers have robbed the characters of their humanity , and everything that might make them interesting . while there are a number of powerful images , panther is a one-note drama which misses the opportunity to include some internal conflict . mario van peebles is developing into a director with a real flair for powerful visuals , and panther is no exception . his use of documentary footage and different film stocks has a bit of oliver stone theatricality , but without the wretched excess . the early scenes of the panthers' emergence as a force have a tense energy . it is a vivid example of why the black panthers' message was so widely embraced , and why they became so powerful so quickly . what van peebles is unable to do is provide any real sense of who these men were , and the reason is one of intent . both screenwriter melvin and director mario are not particularly interested in creating characters , it seems ; they want to create idols . bobby seale is presented as a serene sort of philosopher- king , relegated to the background in favor of the more vocal huey newton . but even newton becomes little more than a figurehead , a mouthpiece for a message rather than a fully-realized man . there is a single scene of eldridge cleaver ( well-played by anthony griffith ) breaking ranks to take more forceful action , but with that exception the black panthers in panther come off as one collective consciousness . the absence of any real internal conflict makes panther become extremely derivative . the tenth or eleventh time , it has long since lost its sting . there are just too many scenes of sneering brutality which become interchangeable in a way i'm sure the van peebles' did not want . the addition of a government/mafia conspiracy to flood the black community with cheap drugs only emphasizes the fact that this is a story entirely about looking outward . the black panther story is an important part of an important time , but it could have had real power if panther had been more about the men behind the movement and less an exercise in hero worship . 
during one fifteen minute sequence in mission : impossible , i was reminded of what a masterful director of suspense brian depalma can be when he is on his game . as cruise attempts to download files and get out of the booby-trapped room safely , depalma creates the kind of suspense that most directors of action only dream about -- you're wondering not only _if_ cruise will be caught , but which alarm will go off first . the cia set piece is crisply edited , and set up and executed with skill and flair . for those fifteen minutes , depalma is a genius again , and mission : impossible is all you could ask a summer adventure-thriller to be . it's telling that you won't see depalma's name anywhere in the advertising campaign for mission : impossible -- he's obviously not considered much of a selling point -- but it's the kind of job that can put a guy back on the a-list . what a shame that with the exception of those furiously tense fifteen minutes , depalma seems to be spending most of his time on damage control . the film is full of cockeyed angles , extreme close-ups , flashbacks and slow-motion , as depalma tries to create the illusion that somewhere buried in all the busy detail of plot , something is actually at stake in mission : impossible . just to demonstrate that i understand the point of mission : impossible , i will observe that it is a premise , a property , a franchise , an identifiable name to be exploited . it is an espionage thriller which comes conveniently after goldeneye has demonstrated that there is still a market for espionage thrillers , and it is yet another escapist entertainment like twister which treats story and character as luxury items not afforded by budgets in the neighborhood of $70 million ( a very comfortable neighborhood ) . there are scenes throughout the film which suggest that we're supposed to find the relationships between people relevant in some way , and instead i found myself scratching my head and wondering where , precisely , i was supposed to have picked up that information . even depalma makes several puzzling choices during the film , including an ill-advised sequence which shows us through flashback that hunt knows someone is lying to him , making a scene which comes later thoroughly anti-climactic . still , he seems most of the time to be trying his best with a script by david koepp and robert towne ( and which featured story assistance from steven zaillian ) which is both simplistic in premise and ridiculously convoluted and confusing in the execution . there is one extremely well-handled and unexpected development quite early in the film , and it offers the hope that mission : impossible is going to avoid the predictability bug . however , at its heart mission : impossible is about one real question -- who is the real traitor -- and i found myself waiting for the inevitable revelation through a morass of ridiculous leaps of logic . mission : impossible's two other action set pieces will certainly have their fans , and there are moments of excitement and cleverness in both of them . but i found the opening sequence brutally edited , and if you've seen any trailers or commercials for the film ( and how could you miss them ) , you've seen the best moment in the big high-speed train finale . no , there is only one real reason to see mission : impossible , and that is those fifteen precious minutes when you are reminded that a scene without special effects can be gripping because it was put together by a superb craftsman , a director who can momentarily make you forget about a sloppy script , and make you care about the fate of cardboard cutouts . 
it is one of the more cumbersome pieces of baggage which goes along with being a film critic that , every once in a while , a film comes along which you are _supposed_ to like on general principle . critics are sometimes placed in the uncomfortable position of being expected to champion small , ennobling films simply because , like cinematic castor oil , they are good for us . we were colored is a film which wears its earnestness proudly on its sleeve ; it means well , and it tries hard . but a film has to have something more going for it than principle , and once upon a time . . . is a well-acted but extremely fragmented story which can't quite get its tone down straight . we were colored is not particularly interested in detailing the day-to-day ugliness of life in the segregated south ; it is a film about a kind of community which no longer exists , and as such it is occasionally quite touching . it is difficult not to watch scenes of 4th of july barbecues for which the whole town turns out , or to notice how the people of glen allan look out for each other , without feeling a sense of sadness that that unity had to disappear with the passing years . the main problem with once upon a time is that it makes frequent side trips to episodic stories which don't resonate , despite insistent voice-over narration ( provided by screenwriter paul w . cooper ) that tries to convince us that they should . the story allows for a scene in a backwater juke joint which adds a bit of atmosphere , but the relationship doesn't really matter , because there's a history there we haven't had a chance to see . there is an incompleteness to many of the individual episodes , and a lack of emotion to scenes which seem designed to provoke an emotional response . too often , however , the film drifts away from cliff's point-of-view , or injects an obligatory bit of racial violence almost because it seems to be expected . first-time feature director tim reid maintains a steady pace and evokes the atmosphere of his setting skillfully , but he doesn't find a narrative in the many stories he is trying to put on the screen . if its story and its characters had been as consistent as its good intentions , it might have been a great film . 
starring : arnold schwarzenegger , james caan , vanessa williams , robert pastorelli . screenplay : tony puryear , walon green . director : charles russell . hardly anyone seems to be talking about it . in a movie season where marketing has attempted to turn every subsequent blockbuster into a pop culture happening , eraser seems to be just another supporting player ; it is even sharing its release date with disney's latest animated fiscal printing press the hunchback of notre dame . arnold seems to have managed the heretofore unthinkable feat of becoming unobtrusive . the result might be an absence of overly high expectations , which can only work in eraser's favor . it's generic schwarzeneggerian action fare which almost manages to seem quaint in its cartoonish basic-ness . eraser is pretty much everything you've come to expect from a schwarzenegger action vehicle : impossible odds , explosions , predictable and groan-inducing one-liners ( if you can't tell me what precedes the line " they had to catch a train , " please sign up for remedial arnie-isms ) , big cool guns , and big cool arnie firing them with abandon . director charles russell ( the mask ) leaps right into the action with scarcely a breath , and for the next 100 minutes seems blissfully concerned with little else . it is as though he were saying to the audience , " i've given you a good guy and some bad guys -- you know how it's going to end , now enjoy the ride . " and in spurts , it's actually possible to do so . in those scenes , eraser is pure mindless fun in the best sense of the term , but those scenes are also somewhat isolated . there is a surprising grimness to much of eraser , including two separate incidents where kruger takes an excruciatingly long time to remove a piece of shrapnel from his flesh , and schwarzenegger himself is overly somber in much of his performance , brooding over a dark past to which we are not made privy . these token attempts by russell and his screenplay-by-committee team to make schwarzenegger more vulnerable and human demonstrate a real misunderstanding of his appeal . audiences come to see schwarzenegger the super-hero , and to laugh along with his awareness of the absurd situations in his action films ; he is the master of the catch phrase because they are winking distillations of those absurdities . there are far too few opportunities to laugh in eraser , except those provided by robert pastorelli as the motor-mouthed wiseguy who becomes kruger's assistant . the irony of eraser is that it turns its greatest asset into a weakness . in a season filled with films which seem to be playing hyped-up games of " can you top this ? " with their visual effects and decibel levels , eraser provides an odd familiarity -- it's just li'l ol' arnie , playing hero and making the world safe for democracy . unfortunately , eraser just rests on its familiarity , providing a bland villain ( caan playing sonny corleone as a turn-coat g-man ) , a bland heroine ( vanessa williams running and serving up the occasional " i-am-woman-watch-me-kick-a-little-ass " bit of crowd-pleasing ) and a finale which is truly anti-climactic . eraser manages a few solidly entertaining moments , and serves up the kind of meat-and-potatoes action schwarzenegger's fans have come to expect . it also is a film which spends a lot of time shuffling its feet , and it will be interesting to see how audiences respond to a blockbuster which seems to be saying , " don't mind me .

there is a single word which is quite conspicuous in its complete absence from the production notes for the adventures of pinocchio : " disney . " there are references to " the version most audiences find familiar , " and comments about the " watered-down " adaptation , but nowhere does anyone acknowledge that disney's 1940 animated classic presents a rather tough act to follow , perhaps as though they are wishing upon a star to erase that legacy . naturally , the film-makers have chosen to push the fact that this version is more " in the spirit " of the 1883 children's tale by carlo collodi than previous film versions , but while the adventures of pinocchio might be closer to the source material than that " version most audiences find familiar , " i suspect it won't be closer to the hearts of many viewers . it is a moderately diverting entertainment for children with little to offer for adults . there are a number of new twists to this telling of " pinocchio " which are actually quite interesting , chief among them the portrayal of pinocchio himself . still there is that legacy , and the adventures of pinocchio finds itself in the most trouble when it brings to mind the way similar sequences were handled by disney . all of the most familiar moments are here -- pinocchio's triumphant performance at the puppet show ; his fib-enhanced growing nose ; the transformation of lampwick ( corey carrier ) into a jackass ; the escape from inside the whale -- but the changes in those scenes are generally cases of trying to make them bigger rather than better . the transformation scene is particularly noteworthy in this respect , placing pinocchio , lampwick and a pair of other boys on what appears to be the indiana jones adventure , rocketing through caverns at maximum speed and volume . barron seems to have no idea what to do with him except consistently have him magnified or placed in annoying perspective shots , and his comments generally consist of limp attempts at anachronistic humor . on the one hand , i want to give barron credit for trying to unify the episodes of " pinocchio , " for eliminating the deus ex machina fairy and for underscoring the relationship between pinocchio and geppetto which seems to be an afterthought in disney's version . unfortunately , he doesn't really get where he wants to go , and he is too interested in keeping the kids happy with slapstick and the ever-popular dog urination gag to pay attention to the story which might mean something to adults . the adventures of pinocchio has enough visual spark to please young audiences , and a noble enough message to appease their parents , but it lacks the wit , warmth and emotional highs to erase the memory it is trying so hard to erase . this pinocchio may become a real boy , but he's not the real thing . 
screenplay : barry fanaro , mort nathan . have you ever had an 11-year-old try to tell you a joke ? if so , you will probably recognize a couple of typical qualities . first , the enthusiasm of the joke-teller far exceeds his mastery of the basic principles of comic timing ; second , the joke is almost certainly one you've heard before , and probably one you told when you were 11 . peter and bobby farrelly ( dumb and dumber ) are still those 11-year-olds at heart , and their sense of humor seems to have matured only marginally . if you laugh at their films , it is probably for the same reasons you might laugh at the 11-year-old's joke : their eagerness to amuse is endearing , or there's a bit of the 11-year-old in you as well . kingpin is often disgusting , but that is usually when it is at its funniest . it is also often slow , and that is when it is an effort to get through . kingpin is a film which tends toward the parody style of the zucker-abrahams-zucker ( airplane ! ) the operative word here is " obvious . " if obviousness were water , kingpin would be the pacific ocean , giving each gag plenty of lead-up time so you can anticipate the punch line and spend a moment groaning as it is underlined for you . when kingpin isn't obvious , it's sick . having covered diarrhea , mucus and urine in dumb and dumber , the farrellys move right along their bodily emissions hit parade to vomit and semen . and when kingpin isn't sick , it's repetitious . there are more individual injuries to male genitalia in this film than in an entire season of " america's funniest home videos . " the thing about kingpin is that even when it is obvious , sick and/or repetitious , it is still often very funny . i will be very frank about this : it is funny in about as base a way as it is possible to be funny , in a way that will be just plain unfunny to many people , or funny in a way that might make you embarrassed to admit you found it funny . it is funny in that adolescent way that can't help but snicker at gags about hardened nipples , farmers and sheep , or oral sex with a painfully unattractive woman . there are a few moments of inspiration in kingpin , particularly a hilarious turn by bill murray as roy's obnoxious rival which harkens back to his smirking glory days , but this really isn't a film meant to operate on an inspired level . it is the kind of leering , slobbering , juvenile comedy mel brooks is still trying to make , but appears to have forgotten how to make , and it sneaks past your sense of indignation , into the most primitive part of your backbrain , and gets you laughing . that said , kingpin still isn't particularly satisfying , mostly because it makes the mistake of trying to create an actual dramatic subtext . harrelson is left in the uncomfortable position of playing a grotesquerie one minute and an ostensibly sympathetic loser the next , and he isn't nimble enough to pull it off . kingpin really crawls during its final half hour as the farrellys play up the redemption story , proving once again that a scattershot comedy of this kind really has to pull in at around 90 minutes . then again , lack of timing is just one more way the farrellys are like 11-year-old joke-tellers . if you are over 21 , kingpin will probably be an erratic ride at best . but if you are able to identify with the 11-year-old in you , hold on to your sides . 
alaska is about as basic as film-making gets , and that is not entirely a criticism . disney used to make a series of films called " true life adventures , " wilderness yarns chock full of great scenery , cute critters and just enough darwinian conflict not to be alarming to the little ones in the audience . those films were basic -- a vista , an animal , a fight , repeat -- but most of the time they were also effective . that is the vibe alaska is looking for , and might actually have matched if it hadn't had so many darned humans . there is some lively adventure in alaska , but when most of the real fun comes on four legs , it is difficult not to lose patience with the two-legged cast members . i won't waste too much time on the trite and silly elements of alaska , because fortunately scripters andy burg and scott myers do us the same favor . it even has the best bad actor in screen history as its villain ( who , coincidentally enough , happens to be the director's father ) . and yes , it does perplex me how sean made it through three days of rock climbing , wading in icy rivers and plodding through the frozen tundra in his adidas high-tops . no , the problem with alaska isn't that the people are one-dimensional characters or mediocre actors . even after coke has turned computer-generated frolicking polar bears into a corporate logo , the real thing is still adorable ; i dare anyone not to smile ad a cuddly cub doing a belly slide down a snowy embankment . that bear is sympathetic and entertaining in a way his human co-stars can never hope to be , and he is the real star of alaska . he just doesn't have any supporting players . that points up a significant drawback in a film which is supposed to be a wilderness adventure , namely that there is not enough wilderness , especially in the first half . there is plenty of photography of majestic locations ( of a strangely flat variety by cinematographer tony westman ) , but fraser c . heston doesn't quite know what to do with it . it is fine for a family adventure like alaska to turn in only a rudimentary plot provided it delivers the thrills , and they finally start coming with about half an hour left . that last half hour is very exciting , though , with a white water sequence as impressive as anything in the river wild and a literal cliff-hanger of a climax . by then , over 70 minutes into alaska , young viewers could be getting might restless . _that's_ a story i really would have enjoyed , and i couldn't help wondering why alaska hadn't tripled its polar bear content much earlier . 
screenplay : edward burns . director : edward burns . there are sound historical reasons for such concern ( think of lee tamahori's mulholland falls or antonia bird's mad love , if you are one of the few people who actually saw them ) , but in the case of edward burns , such concern would seem to be misplaced . for an independent feature , the brothers mcmullen was about as mainstream as they come , a low-key charmer unlikely to offend anyone who wasn't a devout catholic with a short fuse . with a budget about 120 times greater than mcmullen , burns has made she's the one , a film just as unlikely to offend . . . and , unfortunately , equally unlikely to entertain . if there was any real criticism leveled at the brothers mcmullen , it was that it was simply a testosterone-enhanced version of a female bonding film , in which the female characters existed primarily to give the men something to complain about while sharing a beer . at times , she's the one feels like burns' sheepish apology for that aspect of mcmullen , a piece of sensitive self-flagellation . " look how we men make everything in our lives -- our jobs , our hobbies , our fantasies -- more important than our wives , " he says sub-textually . " don't we deserve whatever we get ? " it's a nice gesture , this throwing open of the doors to the boys only club , but burns doesn't support it with characters who ring true , male or female . burns himself has a pleasant , likeable quality , but we are never given any insight into why he would be impetuous enough to marry a near-complete stranger . his dramatic range appears limited to mild annoyance and affability , and burns the actor can't bring to the screen whatever hidden passions burns the writer might have put on paper . let me make this point as subtly as i can : bahns did not get this part because she had a particularly good audition ; she reads a line as though she were going through the script underlining it with her finger . much of the pre-release interest , however , will be focused on the other two main cast members . cameron diaz , the latest next big thing as of 7 : 00 p . m . pdt , provides the same punch of smart sexuality she brought to the mask , and works wonders with a part which could have been a sneering bitch in other hands . her part is actually relatively small , but she gets some of the best and most poignant scenes . while burns seems unwilling to break her of the habit of saying " okay " before nearly every line , her work is still quite solid . it's all very casual and under-stated , but it feels like an extended sit-com -- no character too deep , no problem too complicated . i guess you could say that edward burns has indeed " gone hollywood , " in the most unfortunate sense of the term . 
director : arlene sanford . seventy-nine weeks -- count them , seventy-nine -- is all that separates the release of a very brady sequel from the brady bunch movie , in what has to rank as one of the fastest sequel turnarounds in film history . even taking into account the fact that the brady house sets and alice's uniform were already available , that's a tidy 18 months for writing the script , pre-production , shooting and post-production . you might expect a rather perfunctory piece of film-making given those circumstances , and you would find it . a very brady sequel has some cute moments , but it is lacking the sense of direction which made the brady bunch movie such a guilty pleasure . but all of them should be more concerned about roy , who primarily seems concerned about the whereabouts of a horse statue which could be worth a fortune . the brady bunch movie arrived in the middle of a slew of t . v . -to-film re-treads , so it was easy to overlook the fact that there was actually a point to it besides gratuitous nostalgia . even as the film made referrence to " classic " brady plots , it also provided the wonderful conceit of sealing the bradys in a bubble of obliviousness while time had marched on for everyone else , and it made for a genuinely entertaining remembrance of a simpler time with simpler problems . a very brady sequel misses the boat on both counts . there isn't nearly enough juxtaposition between the bradys and the modern world ; most of the film seems to take place in the brady house , with only a sarcastic matheson to react . as for the echoes of the original series , the most memorable were already used in the first film . we do get a detailed re-creation of jan's imaginary boyfriend george glass , and token references to other episodes like the hawaiian vacation shows ( don't be fooled by ads which make it look like the entire film is set in hawaii ; the bradys don't hit the islands until about twenty minutes remain ) , but a very brady sequel doesn't provide the same warmth of familiarity . there are a few solid laughs in that sub-plot , but unfortunately it underlines an over-reliance on sexual double-entendre of a staggering obviousness . i suppose a limited time frame to work on a script can make you leap for the easy gag . still , a very brady sequel does have the same superb cast to draw on , and they make for a film which seems more creative than it actually is . jennifer elise cox again has the showcase role of neglected middle child jan , and dumping her psychotic " inner voice " makes her desperation for attention a bit more fun . gary cole is also priceless -- it's hard to imagine a more convincingly earnest square , or someone else delivering a line like , " so what are your plans now that you're alive ? " as though it almost made sense . a very brady sequel is occasionally cute , directed competently by arlene sanford , but it's rarely clever . someone had an idea in mind when they made the first film , and that's true of the sequel as well . it's just that the idea this time was closer to , " let's get this thing out there while the kids still look like kids . " 
screenplay : joe gayton , lewis colick . director : ernest dickerson . all right , let's dispense with the preliminaries first : yes , bulletproof recycles material which has been done before -- and done better -- in midnight run and 48 hrs . , among others . yes , it is the kind of movie which has been a thorn in the paw of everyone who has dreamed of a day when hollywood values an original idea . and yes , it includes the kind of sexist and homophobic bits which have been all too characteristic of films of its kind , targeted at the whooping goons of the movie-going world like the one sitting next to me at this film . all these things are true , yet they are not exactly the reason why bulletproof comes up short . you see , bulletproof is frequently quite funny , and it irritated me that i was unable to enjoy the laughs as much as i should have . it is somewhat ironic that archie frequently chides jack for seeing the world as " just black and white , " since that is just one of many ways this film follows the pattern of 90% of " antagonistic buddy cop " movies . just as a little test to check if you've ever seen a movie in this genre before , see if you can guess whether archie and jack are friends when bulletproof ends . that's right , this film takes you where every film of its kind has taken you before , on a bickering ride to an inevitable conclusion , and it is abundantly clear that writers joe gayton and lewis colick are aware of that fact as well . at only 85 minutes , bulletproof still feels long , because there is nothing of any consequence happening , nothing to build momentum towards a resolution . there is a recipe for a film of this kind , and gayton and lewis follow it , and we are simply watching them follow it . the experience is like watching an hour and a half long cooking show in which the final result is a bowl of cereal . i wish it had been easier to dismiss bulletproof given all those problems , but the fact is that it is also quite often funny . adam sandler , who turns in his least annoying screen performance to date ( and if that isn't damning with faint praise , i don't know what is ) , gets most of the prime lines , taunting jack and wise-cracking about the porno films on the motel television where the two spend the night . when sandler isn't trying to play a goofy character , he can deliver a line with a casual zing , and when he isn't screaming he can be funny . of course , it might also be true that screaming is just sandler's way of keeping a straight face ; if you've ever seen sandler perform live , you know that he finds himself hilarious , and when he is trying to " act " in bulletproof it always seems that he is trying not to snicker . damon wayans isn't much better as a thespian , and he is placed in the uncomfortable role of straight man . he does get a few brutal put-downs , but most of the time he is simply playing put-upon , and it doesn't suit him . when he and sandler are allowed to go toe-to-toe , the confrontations are enjoyable , but they are interrupted regularly by tedious and obligatory action sequences . the result is a strange inversion of the formula which made twister so frustrating : i wanted to be around for the scenes when wayans and sandler were trading jibes , but i was ready to head to the lobby as soon as the gunfire started . it is clear that both wayans and sandler -- and the audience -- would have enjoyed 90 minutes of their stand-up routines more than this routine of a somewhat different kind . for all its humor , the real joke in bulletproof is on anyone who expected it to be more than this month's variation on a theme . 
what is it exactly about jean-claude van damme that is so appealing to hong kong directors ? his refusal to let plot interfere in a stunt ? and what else do the two films have in common ? uninspired situations and action which is unlikely to make anyone forget the director's hong kong efforts . i find myself at something of a loss as i try to come up with something worth saying about maximum risk , because it is such a resolutely mediocre film . it even wastes the presence of natasha henstridge , who may not have proven herself to be a gifted thespian yet but still has nearly as much impressive physicality at her disposal as van damme , and the only use to which it is put is in a nude scene which may re-define gratuitous . the one possible interesting twist -- alain is a military-trained crack shot -- is mysteriously kept under wraps until only ten minutes remain in the film , when suddenly he can shoot an eye out at 200 yards . van damme himself is making gradual strides as an actor , something genre cohorts like steven seagal may never do . the problem is that , through his own decisions or those imposed on him by the hollywood hierarchy , van damme performs in the kind of films where serious acting usually looks just plain silly . alain may be deeply affected by learning of the existence of his twin , but when he is forced to react to that knowledge by throwing yet another roundhouse kick or , worse yet , staring into a metaphorically convenient fractured mirror , it is like van damme is playing at acting rather than really acting . it has a dirty feel which is atypical of glossy hollywood adventures , and a few action sequences have real crackle , particularly the opening chase through the streets of nice . lam clearly has the chops to put the action in an action film , a knack for pacing and an awareness of where a camera should go . 
director : al pacino . director of photography : robert leacock . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence ) running time : 110 minutes . part english lecture , part behind-the-scenes documentary and part theater piece , looking for richard is an ambitious experiment created by al pacino as a sort of " everything you always wanted to know about shakespeare but were afraid to ask . " motivated by a desire to make the works of william shakespeare speak to a contemporary audience , pacino spent several years ( evidenced by his now-you-see-it , now-you-don't facial hair in the film ) putting together a film version of " richard iii " which would combine performance of key scenes , observation of the actors wrangling over interpretation of those scenes , and historical background for the play . as an educational tool , looking for richard isn't exactly pitched at those individuals represented in his person-on-the-street interviews , most of whom greet the word " shakespeare " with a shrug or a grimace ( the notable exception being a panhandler who speaks eloquently about how the bard " instructed us how to feel " ) . it is a fairly academic piece of work , with lectures about iambic pentameter intermingled with talking heads describing the events in the play . pacino employs rat-a-tat editing to cut back and forth between locations for rehearsals , descriptive narration and the play itself , resulting in a film which may have been made with the multiplex audience in mind but which seems destined exclusively for the art houses . yet looking for richard is likely to bore those same art house viewers , because the film does not offer much in the way of insight . the actors and academics who speak throughout looking for richard go to such lengths to make the basic plot of " richard iii " understandable that they have little time or inclination to dig deeper . it is also likely that those same art house-attending , shakespeare-loving viewers saw ian mckellen's dynamic richard iii last year , a cinematic rendering which does far more to thrust the play into a 20th century context . pacino himself plays the hunch-backed villain with his typical intensity , and he often shifts into his habit of indicating the significance of a given line by the volume at which he delivers it . it is a straightforward performance , but far better ones are turned in by kevin spacey ( whose buckingham seems so fiercely intelligent that he becomes like an advisor to a modern politician ) and even alec baldwin ( a surprisingly sympathetic clarence ) . winona ryder is a bit less successful as lady anne , and aidan quinn is even less successful as richmond ; quinn in particular is like a walking manifestation of john gielgud's comment in the film that american actors become intimidated by shakespeare because " they've been told they can't do it . " if looking for richard does one thing particularly well , it is to emphasize the interpretive process which makes shakespeare a living text . there may be little inherent drama in a group of actors sitting around a table talking about what they see going on in any given scene , but the scenes of those conversations help to show the unique qualities of performed literature . it is one of the film's best moments when pacino's collaborator frederic kimball explodes in frustration at pacino's plan to ask an " expert " why a character might have acted in a certain way . " you know more about this character , " kimball bellows , and it is a perfectly succinct description of how a role is re-defined by every actor who performs it . that makes looking for richard an interesting supplement for a drama class , but it isn't nearly as worthwhile for an english class . with its snippets of scenes and specific historical asides , looking for richard doesn't exactly teach how to explore the bard's texts . it is more like a filmed version of the cliff's notes . 
screenplay : ruth prawer jhabvala . producers : ismail merchant , david l . wolper . director : james ivory . mpaa rating : r ( brief nudity , adult themes ) running time : 125 minutes . i'm not sure what it is that inspired the highly respected merchant ivory production team to turn from fiction to biography , but i wish they would drop it already . for years , director james ivory , producer ismail merchant and screenwriter ruth prawer jhabvala turned out exceptionally well-crafted adaptations of novels commonly held to be too difficult to film : a room with a view , howards end , the remains of the day . surviving picasso is not nearly as paralyzingly dull , but it demonstrates once again that real people seem to elude ivory and company . surviving picasso is a particularly frustrating piece of work because you can see what it is ivory was trying to do . mcelhone , a newcomer with piercing eyes , brings out the intelligence in francoise , but she becomes a distressingly passive character , even more so when she becomes a narrator for flashbacks . her unique personality has little chance to emerge , and even seems to be contradicted directly by a voice-over near the end in which francoise notes that picasso " made me strong . " picasso himself is similarly enigmatic , played by anthony hopkins as an egomanical bon vivant , turning his fame into a method for making people feel insignificant , and honored merely to be in his presence . ivory and jhabvala do a fine job of showing us the effect of picasso's behavior on those around him , but they are much less effective at showing us the man himself . we are never allowed inside the passionate artist ; hopkins is technically proficient , wandering accent notwithstanding , but his is a role which seems designed to be observed rather than understood . you can always count on a merchant ivory film to look splendid , and there is superb work once again from cinematographer tony pierce-roberts and production designer lucianna arrighi . it is a beautiful environment they have created for this story , but the characters in that environment are disappointing . there are several moments in surviving picasso which inspire a curiosity about this fascinating man , notably his rivalry with contemporary henri matisse ( joss ackland ) , but there is always the nagging sense , as there was in jefferson in paris , that ivory doesn't really have a point of view . his biographies are safe , almost documentary detailings of events in an individual's life which do not add up to a story . picasso and jefferson were both fascinating historical figures with private and public lives full of contradictions , and they should have made for great drama . ivory simply seems too respectful of his subjects , content to lay out events like they might appear in a history text without much in the way of interpretation . the irony is that he has been able to take far more internalized fictional characters , like the remains of the day's james stevens , and make them extraordinarily vivid . 
screenplay : randy kornfield and deborah kaplan & harry elfont . director : brian levant . mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , cartoon violence ) running time : 89 minutes . jingle all the way is the first film from chris columbus' 1492 production company which was not directed by columbus himself , and i found myself curious as to whether it would resemble the producing efforts of his mentors steven spielberg and john hughes -- more specifically , would it look like a clone of columbus' own films ? just as an experiment , i predicted to myself that jingle all the way would involve an irresponsible/inconsiderate adult who , after plenty of broadly comic trials and tribulations , learns what's really important . that particular combination of slapstick and sentimentality had served columbus well in two home alone films , mrs . i suspect columbus may be fond of such warm-n-fuzzy denouements because he wants to leave his audience with the impression that it has watched something more meaningful than a live-action cartoon . the fact is that jingle all the way is in many ways a better cartoon than space jam , directed by brian levant ( the flintstones ) with an emphasis on absurd , elaborate sequences of physical comedy which at least have a certain momentum . the " turbo man " tv program is a neat little jab at " power rangers " -type shows in all their over-marketed glory , and schwarzenegger's encounter with an enraged reindeer works better than it sounds . miraculously , there is also only one scene of a kick to the groin in all the mayhem . it is when jingle all the way turns message-y on us that it not only loses steam , but demonstrates its crucial bit of mis-casting . in the past , he has gone for laughs playing against his image , his sheer physical presence -- see arnie paired with danny devito as a mild-mannered genius in twins , see arnie struggle with toddlers in kindergarten cop , see arnie pregnant in junior . in jingle all the way , he is frequently put in the position of threatening people to get his way , and it is not nearly the visual gag it could have been when the massive schwarzenegger is forced to play the part of turbo man in a parade . a steve martin , michael keaton or even robin williams might have made howard's quest more interesting , and the character more sympathetic ; with big arnold , jingle is simply frantic and a bit too mean-spirited . fortunately , schwarzenegger has a pair of comic co-stars with more sense for the material . sinbad plays a character with no consistent personality -- sometimes a harmless nut , sometimes the film's villain -- but he can still make lame material funny ( witness first kid ) . if jingle all the way had to star schwarzenegger , it is to levant and columbus' credit that they got someone both funny _and_ a physical match to be his adversary . what's really important to remember about jingle all the way is that its target audience is probably under 12 years old , and that 90% of the humor involves bodily injury , property damage , or some combination of the two . he's already discovered a formula which works . 
screenplay : leslie bohem . director : rob cohen . running time : 115 minutes . it is one of the more trustworthy rules of popular culture that everything old must eventually become new again , and 1996 at the movies sure has looked a lot like the mid-70s . twister and independence day were less like contemporary action films than the were heirs to the disaster epics of twenty years ago , with plucky bands of one-dimensional characters trying to withstand barrages of special effects . with two volcano films and james cameron's titanic on the horizon , it is beginning to feel like irwin allen has taken over hollywood again , and that thought doesn't inspire much nostalgia . daylight is a poseidon adventure clone with a few effectively tense moments , but it is so plodding and mechanical that it is rarely entertaining . that leaves him in danger as well , though the greatest danger isn't entirely clear . daylight begins with a couple of red-herring criminal activities which end up causing the firestorm in the tunnel , but it is indicative of the shortcomings of the script that the bad guys then become cinders rather than sticking around to make any more sparks fly . there simply isn't enough to any of the characters to give the conflict energy ; everything we know about each of them comes from a series of postage-stamp sized establishing scenes , and that's not nearly enough . with the vague bureaucratic malevolence aboveground and the muted mutineering below ground as the only antagonism in most of daylight , the absence of a real villain becomes a distinct drawback , and results in a plot which grinds from impossible situation to yet-more-impossible situation . that is not to say that there is no drama in daylight , though little of it comes from the silly dialogue or thin characterizations . surprisingly , it also doesn't come from the special effects by industrial light and magic , which often have a strangely low-budget quality . repeatedly , characters are forced to decide who can be saved , or whether someone is worth saving , and director rob cohen ( dragonheart ) somehow makes those moments matter even though individual characters don't . that alone might be more than you would expect from a sylvester stallone action film , although sly himself merely seems to be going through the motions . screenwriter leslie bohem has handed him a character which even seems to be a barely re-worked version of his tragedy-scarred , redemption-hungry role in cliffhanger , and he wanders grimly through most of the film without showing us any hint of a personality . he also has to carry daylight on his broad shoulders , because this is one disaster film which doesn't blow its budget on putting an all-star cast in harm's way ; amy brenneman and viggo mortensen are no faye dunaway and fred astaire . however , daylight does try to follow up on one bit of disaster film trivia -- both the poseidon adventure and the towering inferno won best original song academy awards -- by serving up a sappy romantic ballad called " whenever there is love . " the female half of the duet ? donna summer . yes indeed , folks , it sure does feel like the mid-70s all over again . 
mpaa rating : not rated ( brief nudity , profanity , boxing violence ) running time : 90 minutes . a study of two figures from the glory days of boxing is only part of what when we were kings tries to deliver , however , and it is only the chance to see ali at his verbal and physical finest which grips you while much of the film drifts off on tangents . part of gast's focus in when we were kings involves the extraordinary nature of the event itself . foreman , meanwhile , could not understand why he was treated like the villain , or worse , ignored entirely . gast frequently moves back and forth between preparation for the fight itself and peripheral events , but this technique ends up muddling when we were kings about as often as it enriches it . an air conditioning failure at the musicians' hotel has everyone in a tizzy , but we never hear about it again ; the anecdotes involving extreme measures taken by zaire's dictator mobutu sese seko to clean up the country for foreign press are interesting , but gast doesn't tell us how the delay affected those efforts . it also doesn't help that gast can't quite decide whether when we were kings is a piece of social history or a piece of sports history . yet gast appears to deal with the actual fight as a necessary evil , or as padding to fill out a documentary about something else which was struggling to make feature length . when we were kings might be a few different documentaries crammed into one film , but it still delights whenever muhammad ali is center stage . more than anything else , gast wants the film to act as a memorial to the charismatic ali who never failed to provide a quote or a headline . the portrait that emerges captures ali at his cocky , trash-talking , rhyme-spinning finest , but it also shows the deeply committed muslim who viewed his trip to zaire as a kind of pilgrimage . 
director : tim burton . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , profanity , brief sexual situations ) . running time : 105 minutes reviewed by scott renshaw . i really wanted mars attacks ! to be the movie independence day wasn't . tim burton's malevolent alien invasion saga faces such obvious comparisons to 1996's other malevolent alien invasion saga that it would have been a pleasure to find that this one was the little b-movie homage that could , juxtaposed with the big b-movie re-tread that couldn't . i came ready for delight , and instead i found disappointment . is a more inventive film than independence day , but it is also a sluggish one , in addition to having a surprising streak of nastiness . if you didn't know mars attacks ! what is surprising is that these stories are played so straight , and with nearly as little character development as independence day . pierce brosnan and sarah jessica parker are entertaining as the unctuous kessler and a dim fashion reporter , respectively , but their appearance is most memorable because they share a tender love scene as severed heads . that moment highlights what is both best and worst about mars attacks ! , which is the perverse visual humor . burton tosses out some truly twisted gems along with just-plain-silliness , and the deliberately cheesy visual effects are both effective on their own and as a source for an internal joke involving a godzilla film . the problem is that nothing really builds in mars attacks ! ; the jokes are often stand-alone vignettes un-related to anything which precedes them or anything which follows them , making for a film which jerks along unsteadily with little momentum . is based on a series of trading cards by topps , and appropriately enough that is the way the movie feels : you flip over one scene , chuckle at it , then forget it almost before you flip over the next one . the one thing burton and screenwriter jonathan gems do much better than independence day is allow us to get to know the aliens , and what a bunch of leering interplanetary sociopaths they are . the scenes on board the flying saucers show the martians' delight at duping humanity and wreaking havoc , and while the malicious martians provide their share of laughs , the whole concept is strangely mean-spirited . burton almost seems to share this smirking disregard for his characters ( and an unexplainable hatred of birds ) as he reduces them to scorched skeletons in scenes which may be too graphic for youngsters . there is plenty of imagination in mars attacks ! ( the aliens' downfall certainly does not involve a computer virus ) , but the ideas prickle rather than tickle . something seemed to be annoying tim burton when he made mars attacks ! , and he's probably going to be more annoyed if audiences decide it isn't the movie independence day was . 
just in case you think the term " soccer mom " was nothing but a convenient demographic catch-phrase for the 1996 presidential election , one fine day presents michelle pfeiffer as an in-the-flesh soccer mom , and her life is every bit as complicated as we have been led to believe . it's one frantic day , all right , one that is equally frantic for " soccer dad " george clooney , and it begins to turn one fine day into a soci-political spin on planes , trains and automobiles . unfortunately , this is supposed to be a romantic comedy , and the romance is dropped into this unfocused piece of work like an afterthought . if the idea of one fine day is simply to show us how tough single parents have it , then i suppose it does its job . one fine day is basically a string of crises of varying magnitude , and while a few are amusing , the cumulative effect inspires more anxiety than chuckles . with inserts of clocks consistently reminding us of impending deadlines , one fine day delivers the nerve-wracking realism of impossible demands without leavening it with enough humor . it also delivers very little romance , and that's a shame , because pfeiffer and clooney click in the few moments they actually share the screen . there is a pat quality to the contemporary urban battle-of-the-sexes banter -- think when harry met sally at the day care center -- but neither star cranks up the sniping to an aggravating livel . by the time you get there , however , you may be nearly as exhausted as melanie and jack . director michael hoffman ( soapdish , restoration ) has made some interesting films with a lot going on in them , but one fine day is a case where he just wasn't able to tame the script ( by terrel seltzer and ellen simon ) . you may be startled when you realize that there is still a lot of one fine day left to go , time for it to deliver at last the relationship it teased you with in trailers , posters , and ninety minutes of running time . by that point it has become clear that , like its protagonists , one fine day is too busy for something as mundane as a relationship when there are jobs to do , kids to watch and , yes , soccer games to attend . 
screenplay : robert harling . director : robert harling . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , sexual situations ) running time : 130 minutes . the evening star has so much good will working for it from the start that it would have taken an effort to make it a complete catastrophe . screenwriter and director robert harling is well-aware of this history , and his opening credits sequence tries to make the most of it . over pictures of maclaine , debra winger and jeff daniels , michael gore's familiar terms of endearment theme plays , working that good will like a boxer works the body to soften up the opponent . the unintended effect of these familiar signifiers , however , is to remind you how much more focused and satisfying a film terms was than the evening star . the key to the success of terms of endearment lay in its pitch-perfect study of a contentious mother-daughter relationship , yet it is not exactly because emma is absent that the evening star feels less potent . that one relationship focused terms , however ; you knew exactly what it was really about . the evening star is in desperate need of that kind of focus . harling throws a lot of stuff at the screen , and some of it sticks , notably some exceptional moments for ross and a few catty exchanges between maclaine and richardson . unfortunately , there isn't enough of the stuff that works , and plenty of down time as harling searches for a narrative deserving of aurora's fire . shirley maclaine obviously has a blast returning to the role of aurora , and that obvious joy is likely to bring an audience with her farther than the material itself deserves . aurora preens deliciously after she spends the night with jerry , smiles a venomous smile as she catches patsy in a deception , and generally makes overbearing motherhood her own personal fiefdom ; it's just plain fun to spend time with a character this colorful . if only maclaine hadn't made so many of aurora's quirks so familiar by taking on a succession of infuriating-but-lovable roles distinguishable from one another only by the film in which they appeared -- steel magnolias , postcards from the edge , guarding tess , mrs . all found maclaine doing riffs on aurora with varying degrees of success , and even a lively performance feels recycled after so many precursors . it doesn't feel at all like we have missed over a decade of aurora greenway's life . we've just been watching her using aliases . it is one of nicholson's best and most restrained pieces of film acting in years ; he seems both genuinely pleased to see his old love , and genuinely unsure about how to interact with her . there is so much affection and charm in those few scenes , as all the soap opera plot developments and histrionics take a breather , that it almost feels like 1983 all over again . 
screenplay : michael scott myers , based on the memoir by novalyne price ellis . mpaa rating : pg ( plentiful mild profanity , adult themes ) running time : 105 minutes . bio-pics have been a hollywood staple about as long as there has been a hollywood , but recently an entire sub-genre seems to have popped up based on the tragic romances of real-life figures . some of these films worked and some did not , but many of them inspired the question of whether we would care all that much about the people involved if one or both of them were not famous . the whole wide world is a polite , well-acted drama which covers the same ground several times over in an hour and forty-five minutes . the whole wide world manages to stay fairly involving for much of its running time largely thanks to the strong performances of the two leads . she walks a fine line between anachronistic liberation and discomfiting masochism , yet generally finds the right note of earnest frustration . together zellweger and d'onofrio make an intriguing pair , a couple of kindred spirits who nevertheless are quite obviously wrong for each other . therein lies the whole wide world's fundamental flaw as a romantic drama : it is never really possible to root for the protagonists to end up together . as honestly felt as it might be , however , her story lacks a narrative push . the interaction between the two is pleasantly interesting , but it isn't enough to sustain a story in which neither character ends up changing very much . the sad fact is that the story might have been simply novalyne's attempt to work through some guilt issues ( howard committed suicide in 1935 ) , and the whole wide world is affectionate without being compelling . you just wonder why that sentiment warranted a feature film . there is so much more going on in that relationship than in the one between bob and novalyne that you wish ireland or myers had recognized it . but this is novalyne's story , so she is always front and center , static though she might be . don't expect a love story in the whole wide world . at most it is a " like " story , and might have been ignored politely if one of the two likers had not created conan the barbarian . 
director : jane campion . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( brief nudity , adult themes ) running time : 145 minutes . directors , both cinematic and theatrical , face their greatest challenges when dealing with " classic " material , and not just because audience familiarity with the text makes every step a potentially treacherous one . no , the real temptation is to go too far in an attempt to make the material -- pronounce the following word dripping with sarcasm -- " relevant . " never mind that the text most likely achieved its lofty status because its themes transcend the socio-political flavor of the month ; the director is determined to give it a contemporary spin . the irony of jane campion's adaptation of henry james' the portrait of a lady is that campion treats the narrative , a narrative with an intrinsic emotional force , with meticulous faithfulness , while her heavy hand as a director inspires plenty of head-shaking . campion opens the portrait of a lady with voice-overs of modern women discussing their thoughts on romantic love , followed by a credits sequence featuring black-and-white images of women ( we assume the same ones we just heard ) just hanging out together in nature . campion certainly sympathizes with female characters who seem trapped by societal proscriptions ( like the heroines of an angel at my table and the piano ) , but nearly every interpretation of isabel feels misguided and simplistic . the central question of why isabel marries osmond is addressed with a pair of fantasy sequences which make the jarring suggestion that her tragic decision was the product of good old-fashioned lust . that notion might have been easier to stomach if osmond had been played by anyone other than john malkovich . malkovich has turned the aloof lothario into his stock character , but the portrayal has become more chilly than chilling . it is a perfectly valid interpretation to suggest that isabel had no choice ; it may also be the least interesting one . after hammering away at us with the restrictive nature of isabel's 19th century world for two and a half hours ( and at times you can feel every minute of it ) , it feels like a cheat for her to rehash the same point when addressing the most compelling enigma the novel has to offer . it is all the more frustrating because there are so many other things the portrait of a lady does right . with the exception of malkovich , the casting is superb , including nicole kidman as the wide-eyed innocent abroad with the eraserhead hairdo . barbara hershey and screenwriter laura jones to a particularly fine job with madame merle , a complex creature of uncertain motivations . de merteuil to malkovich's recycled valmont . martin donovan is also quite good as the consumptive , kind-hearted ralph , and mary-louise parker has a delightful bluntness as isabel's american friend henrietta . the production offers a variety of pleasures , notably stuart dryburgh's impressive photography , but campion flattens the most involving stories in the portrait of a lady . james' clash of american and european sensibilities becomes campion's clash of 19th century and 20th century sensibilities . the result is essentially a cautionary tale which only matters if you plan on doing any time travel , or a film treatment of a hypothetical prequel : " smart women who make foolish choices : the early years . " 
screenplay : john cleese and iain johnstone . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( strong language , adult themes ) running time : 95 mintues . in case you were unclear on this point , fierce creatures is _not_ technically a sequel to a fish called wanda . . . though for the life of me i can't figure out why that was the case . it isn't as though john cleese had a radically different idea in mind for reuniting the four principal cast members . a great deal of effort went into reminding you why you might have enjoyed a fish called wanda , and then fierce creatures only delivers halfway . though buoyed by a couple of wildly farcical set pieces , fierce creatures often feels like a film in search of an identity . i don't blame the makers of fierce creatures for making its main characters so similar to those in wanda , because they were simply following a time-honored tradition for recurring comic teams . from abbott and costello through spade and farley , it has been understood that it is important for roles to be defined . id is id and ego is ego and never the twain should meet ; what would the audience make of it if curly suddenly began to browbeat moe ? the problem with fierce creatures isn't that its characters are familiar , it is that they are just familiar enough to be disappointing . cleese does the put-upon bit , but he's not put-upon _enough_ ; kline does the dense bit , but he's not dense _enough_ . the foursome found a dynamic in a fish called wanda which worked to perfection , and there are at least a few references in fierce creatures intended to capitalize on that goodwill . the script simply leaves you waiting on several occasions , waiting for it to take an extra comedic step which doesn't come . wanda also featured the delightful sub-text of the clash between british and american cultures , and fierce creatures chooses corporate avarice and gross commercialism as its satirical targets . yet there too the script by cleese and iain johnstone is disappointingly half-hearted with its jabs . the ruthless tycoon played by kline is clearly modeled after ruppert murdoch , yet he escapes with no more interesting a character trait than occasional flatulence ; the outrageous possibilities of a zoo with a ton of corporate sponsors yield some amusing results ( particularly the zoo uniforms covered in more labels than a stock car ) , but there is no major payoff . it is surprising primarily because cleese did a funnier and more concise job of skewering advertising in the schwepps spot which accompanied the american video release of wanda , a spot recalled by an advertisement cleese wears on the back of his suit coat in creatures . there are a pair of winning scenes in the classic farce tradition of slamming doors and near misses , one in a hotel room and the other involving the younger mccain's attempt to impersonate his father , yet that latter scene also reminds you of what is missing in much of the humor in fierce creatures . until the finale of fierce creatures , which includes a startling bit of black humor , the film feels terribly tame . the animals in this film aren't subjected to cruel fates ; they are photographed in all their quirky cuteness for " awww " moments and used for sometimes amusing slapstick comedy . too many things about fierce creatures feel just slightly askew , like the conflicted results of film-makers trying both to remind you of something and to make something completely different . at times , his work sparks memories not just of wanda's outrageousness , but of classic monty python as well ; at other times , he seems to have softened with age . he is just one of several creatures in fierce creatures which isn't quite fierce enough . 
like most television performers venturing into feature films , fran drescher chose a first starring vehicle which would be comfortable in its familiarity . not much of a stretch , it would seem , until you take into account the fact that drescher isn't just playing a nanny in this case -- she's stepping into the shoes of the quintessential representation of screen nanny-dom , julie andrews . you see , the beautician and the beast may be part variation on " beauty and the beast " and part variation on the old " fish-out-of-water " comedy , but at its core it is something else . the beautician and the beast is really the sound of music remade , with a nasal new yawka instead of a novitiate . that may not sound terribly appealing , and indeed the extent to which you will enjoy the beautician and the beast may depend on how much of drescher you can take in one sitting . the beautician and the beast is a slight , meandering little film which is hard to get a handle on . todd graff's script goes most of the expected places , creating conflict between the controlling boris and the uncontrollable joy and providing stock characters like a good advisor ( ian mcneice ) to take joy's side and a bad advisor ( patrick malahide ) to make the soon-to-be-reformed boris look better by comparison . he also tosses in obscure references ( how many audience members are going to remember norma rae ? ) and scatters his multiple sub-plots all over the pace to be picked up whenever time permits . the plot drifts from joy's street-wise counsel to each of boris's children to preparations for the arrival of potential foreign investors , never really lingering anywhere long enough for the events to be of anything but casual interest . director ken kwapis doesn't develop any kind of comic rhythm in beautician , allowing many of the thin gags to stand alone . i suppose one alternative to creating a structure is swiping one , hence the extended riff on the sound of music . the similarities could almost be represented by one of those tables with the two films as the headings . i would not have been surprised to hear timothy dalton break into a chorus of " edelweiss " at least the beautician and the beast ends where the sound of music should have ended , with the kiss before all the political upheaval . the romance in the film is actually fairly appealing , thanks largely to the entertaining work of timothy dalton . he has a gruff , goofy charm as the stalin-esque dictator who grows warm and cuddly , giving spark to boris' sudden desire to become a populist even if it doesn't make much sense . he also shares a nice chemistry with drescher whenever she tones down the attitude for a quieter moment , but quiet is a relative consideration where drescher is concerned . there is also no question that it can be distracting , even if it is her calling card and gives her an edge many female comics could use more of . if you can get past the drescher drone , you might be able to ride along on the feather-light romantic comedy of the beautician and the beast . when the sound of the leading lady is hardly the sound of music , however , that kind of enjoyment may not be as simple as do-re-mi . 
just so our points of reference are clear , the original that darn cat was hardly a classic . the folks at disney have been using that word as though they have a trademark on it , tossing it at everything it has ever committed to celluloid and becoming their own worst enemies as these " classics " are remade as gaudy nonsense like 101 dalmatians . 1965's that darn cat , however , was simply a cute little caper featuring disney's two principal live-action studio players of the 1960s , dean jones and hayley mills , and hardly a sacred treasure . the second life of that darn cat is very different from the first , but it's hard to say whether it is an improvement . it is a strange sort of family film : clever and amusing in some surprising ways , but disappointing at delivering the goods to keep the kids entertained . the script for that darn cat is attributed to " s . you can certainly see those bloodlines in the eccentric characters who populate the film , and who give edgefield its edge . and we haven't even mentioned doug e . doug's twitchy turn as the f . b . i . agent , whose facial tics grow a bit aggravating but is simply hilarious when he goes into full prowl mode in his attempt to " think like a cat . " that's quite a switch from the 1965 version , where the cat had infinitely more personality than any human in the film . i'm also not sure that was a wise decision . the cat in the new that darn cat actually plays a fairly miniscule role in the proceedings , and while that leaves plenty of goofy goings-on which might entertain adults , kids may be somewhat disappointed by the film . director bob spiers ( british television's " absolutely fabulous " and " fawlty towers " ) maintains a fairly languid pace for much of that darn cat's running time , focusing on quirky character vignettes rather than funny feline frolicking . in fact , there's no particular reason for a cat to have anything to do with this plot ; it would have been just as easy for patti to find the watch herself and gradually discover the dark side of edgefield . spiers does pull out some strange and original physical comedy , like agent kelso's unexplained ability to do a gravity-defying backflip over a fence or his enthusiastic dive into a garbage bin , but most of the humor comes from silly behavior which might leave the little ones restless or unimpressed . spiers suddenly seems to become aware of the relative absence of broad , fast-paced slapstick in the final twenty minutes , which consist almost entirely of an extended car chase between patti and kelso and the kidnapers . after 70 minutes with scarcely a bit of john hughes-ian bodily injury humor to be found , that darn cat turns into " the dukes of hazard , " with cars flying through the air , glass shattering and gas stations exploding into a fireworks display . that darn cat makes some unfortunate choices -- particularly turning the search for the kidnapers into a mystery which results in a predictable " scooby-doo " style unmasking -- but for a remake of a disney film from an era which thrived on formula , this darn cat is surprisingly unpredictable . if this were not the kind of film where most of the audience _wants_ predictability , that quality alone would be enough to recommend it . it pains me not to recommend that darn cat , a film which would be a welcome change of pace for any parent who has had to sit through hyperactive kiddie fare like 101 dalmatians or space jam . i only wish it had more energy , more for the children , more of that darn cat . it could have been one of the rare live action disney films to deserve the term " classic . " 
personal problems and terrible choices in film projects -- dreadfully comedies like fletch lives , nothing but trouble and cops and robbersons -- have turned chase into a poster boy for unfulfilled career potential , and lately it seems that he is trying so hard to win back his audience's good will that it simply comes off as pathetic . his latest attempt to re-animate the corpse of his film career -- a return for a fourth draw from the successful vacation well -- probably seemed like a good idea at the time , and the film isn't a complete disaster . it's simply so lacking in attempts at humor that chase might have had a better chance at coming up with a winner playing a slot machine . after fourteen years and three previous films , the vacation series has been around long enough to be the target of some in-jokes , and a couple of the film's best gags are based on familiarity with 1983's national lampoon's vacation at the very least . early in the film , clark laments a lack of family time together by noting to the kids , " i hardly recognize you any more ; " after four different actors have played both audrey and rusty , it's not surprising . unfortunately , the series has also been around long enough for the audience to expect a certain level of outrageousness and wild sight gags a la series creator john hughes , and vegas vacation simply limps along for much of its 92 minutes . the truth is that many of the actual jokes in vegas vacation are funny ; there are just stretches of minutes at a time when there isn't even an attempt at a joke to be found . the film gets particularly tedious when it follows the exploits of audrey and rusty ( played with a transcendental blandness by nichols and embry ) , but it's not much better trying to turn wayne newton into a comic actor . screenwriter elisa bell has set a film in one of the easiest cities in the country to make fun of , yet she seems unable to come up with anything funny to say about it . in fact , between the sluggish script and the extended sequences showing off the vegas sights and observing a siegfried and roy show , you'd think that vegas vacation had been commissioned by the nevada chamber of commerce . the biggest surprise in vegas vacation turns out to be that after over an hour of snooze-inducing nonsense , it comes up with one of the most purely inspired comic sequences of the last few years . i was nearly in tears laughing as a stone-faced croupier at the " i'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10 " table informed clark that 7 was incorrect , then almost immediately angry that a fraction of that imagination hadn't gone into the rest of the film . perhaps those five minutes can serve as a launching pad to better choices . but i wouldn't bet on it . 
there is a scene about half way through blood and wine which , for the briefest of moments , inspires the giddy sense that you may be seeing something quite different . seconds later , you realize you aren't ; within a few minutes , you realize you're watching a movie with an inordinate fondness for inflicting punishment on its characters , and nicholson just happened to be first in line . with all the consternation over violence in the movies , you could easily forget that the kind of violence you tend to see in movies is fairly distant and antiseptic : gunfights in which people fall over like kids on a playground , comic book hand-to-hand combat where the winner walks away with a split lip and a smudged forehead . blood and wine may be the most brutal film ever made in which a gun is never fired . add a slow death after a car accident and a scene of nicholson suturing his own eyebrow , and you have a thriller strictly for the strong of stomach . with all the unpleasantness blood and wine asks its viewers to tolerate , you'd think it would offer a more satisfying pay-off for all the time spent shifting in their seats . that certainly creates an appropriately dark tone , but there is scarcely a drop of wit to lighten the relentless gloom . after recent films like bound have found a way to make you giggle at the tough talk even as you are engrossed in the story , blood and wine comes off as something to be endured rather than enjoyed . it might have helped a bit if there had been a hero worth rooting for . he sneers defiant insults at stepfather alex and falls in lust at first sight with gabriela , all the while acting like a 14-year-old rather than a 24-year-old . his refusal to get a life of his own might have made sense if the script had really followed up on a whisper of oedipal sub-text between jason and suzanne ; instead , you just want him to stop pouting and find an apartment . the only genuinely interesting think in blood and wine -- and it is a very interesting thing -- is michael caine's performance as victor . caine gives victor the weight of a shakespearean villain , his rotting body a reflection of his rotted morality , but his actions always seem born of fear rather than spite . only caine keeps you watching when your better judgment recommends turning away from blood and wine , a film where you find yourself ducking to avoid the psychic shrapnel as characters inflict pain on each other as though it were their job . 
producers : bernd eichinger and martin moskowicz . director : bille august . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , sexual situations ) running time : 119 minutes . before smilla's sense of snow , the last time director bille august gut hold of a mysterious , best-selling novel was 1994's the house of the spirits . if that thought doesn't send a shudder of dread through you at the prospects for smilla , you were probably fortunate enough to miss the house of the spirits . spirits was a disastrous combination of mis-guided casting and even more mis-guided story-telling , and it lost all sense of isabel allende's magical realism . peter hoeg's _froken smillas fornemmelse for sne_ ( miss smillas' feeling for snow ) presented a similarly challenging combination of atmosphere , character and plot , and august , but this time around he has been much more faithful to the source material . unfortunately , the result still isn't a particularly good film . as tense and evocative as smilla's sense of snow is during its first hour , it shares the fundamental flaw of the novel : a strange plot device which may leave you wondering if you've just seen " the x-files " movie . you'd never expect a film with the plot i just described based on the first scene in smilla's sense of snow . the moment is spectacular , but when the scene suddenly shifts to modern copenhagen and the film becomes a dark , moody mystery , you might wonder whether you've just had an out-of-genre experience . more to the point , you might fear that august has snapped his cap . actually , august is simply preparing the audience for the radical shift still to come , a shift which wasn't nearly as radical in hoeg's novel . for about three-quarters of its length , smilla's sense of snow is a fairly compelling character study anchored by a strong lead performance . julia ormond may be a bit young for hoeg's smilla , but she makes the character her own with an unapologetic toughness uncommon in female screen characters . screenwriter ann biderman has done a fine job of paring down the novel's often-cumbersome plot and its glut of conspirators , allowing the focus to stay squarely on smilla and her relationships . ormond's performance and august's direction capture hoeg's lyrical , haunting psychological drama , a style reminiscent of _the english patient_ author michael ondaatje . but then there's that third act , and there's nothing august , biderman or anyone else can do about smilla's sense of snow's unexpected metamorphosis from michael ondaatje to michael crichton except take it all the way overboard . the greenland-based climax includes some splendid landscapes by cinematographer jorgen persson , and the arctic vastness suggests the coming of a resolution with an internal dimension -- smilla coming to terms with her life , her land and her heritage . the finale is so utterly bizarre -- and so unsatisfying -- that it taints the entire two hour experience of smilla's sense of snow . 
selena enjoyed a phenomenal popularity among mexican-americans , and seemed poised to cross over to mainstream english-language success as well . well , after two hours and ten minutes of selena , i'm still not quite sure . there are plenty of details about selena's life , but no _story_ of her life . without a compelling narrative direction , selena becomes a polished and respectful feature film version of an a&e " biography . " nava tries to cover a lot of ground in selena , and one of the film's primary flaws is that it seems more interested in relating events than in giving those events any shape . there are a dozen minor conflicts strewn throughout selena , many of which could have been used to define what this film is about . there are even confusing gaps in the story-telling ( who were those guys who trashed chris's hotel room , anyway ? which make selena feel even more unfocused . selena generally feels most on-track when it captures her performances . the concert footage is somewhat over-dramatized , but jennifer lopez gives a charismatic performance as selena , lip-synching to the real selena's recordings while smiling a thousand-watt smile and radiating a genuine affection for her fans . nava tries to give her calling more weight -- selena says at one point that she feels " all the hopes and dreams " of her fans -- but mostly she just seems to be a born performer with an approachable personality . lopez has some very nice moments , as does the generally reliable olmos . his intensity , and the sense of responsibility he instills in selena as a mexican-american celebrity , give selena its greatest sense of purpose . even then , however , it still feels compromised by its unwillingness to dig very deeply . more to the point of the film , nava tells selena's story as though she should be a hero simply because she was a successful chicana . there are worse reasons to lionize someone than for being a good role model , and it is certainly a tragedy that a young woman died too soon , but the story of selena's life just doesn't make for a very compelling dramatic film . selena didn't need to be filled with dirt ; it just needed a reason for being besides providing a pleasant but unremarkable memorial to a pleasant but unremarkable singer . the well-made and well-acted selena will almost certainly satisfy selena's fans . those of us who didn't understand why she was so beloved may have to wait for the unauthorized biography . 
screenplay : shuki levy and shell danielson . directors : david winning and shuki levy . mpaa rating : pg ( violence , mild profanity ) running time : 100 minutes . you've got to hand it to saban entertainment , keepers of the power rangers franchise . in the notoriously fickle business of children's entertainment and merchandising , the rangers have survived by changing just enough to keep their young fans interested . costumes have been updated ; new iterations of action figures have filled the shelves . even characters have been replaced in rejuvenating line-up changes , making the rangers akin to a super-powered menudo . yet the most misguided changes to date have been those in 1995's lifeless mighty morphin power rangers : the movie , which substituted high-tech hardware for low-tech charm . turbo : a power rangers movie is still dopey kiddie fare , but it's an improvement over mmpr : tm by orders of magnitude , with a couple more changes still up its sleeve . it can be a monumental effort for anyone over 12 to make it through power rangers material , simply because it is so steadfastly simplistic . robot side-kick alpha , and the plots are elemental fantasy tales with an " afterschool special " moral usually tacked on somewhere . turbo adds to the mix a lovable little character who can heal with a touch and can't survive long on earth . . . no , not e . t . , but an incredible simulation in the muppet-faced lerigot . the formula is so unshakeable in its blandness that , within the context of the rangers universe , the twists turbo serves up can only be described as ingenious . it's also nice to have someone repeating the rangers' morphing mantra of " awesome ! " who doesn't sound like an immature nit-wit while doing it . the appearance is good for a gasp of recognition from long-time ranger watchers , but it also gives the characters a dose of personality they never had as heroes . kimberly and jason actually spend most of their screen time trying to break out of the cargo hold of divatox's ship , and those scenes are surprisingly well-crafted and tense . for an action film designed for children , turbo is actually rather restrained , with more emphasis on suspenseful escapes than special effects-laden free-for-alls . directors david winning and shuki levy are working with some pretty limp material , but they make the most of it . they also correct the fatal flaw of the first power rangers feature by dumping the computer-generated zords and making the final megazord-vs . -megademon battle what it always should be : a battle of two guys in big rubber suits . turbo is unquestionably more fun for kids than for adults , but it is put together with some care , and it's a step in the right direction . day the ever-evolving rangers might morph into a movie franchise worth watching . 
director : pat o'connor . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , nudity ) running time : 108 minutes . voice-over narration is a common cinematic device , particularly in nostalgic period films , yet i can think of few narrated films in the last thirty years which wouldn't have been better without it . narration tends to be a crutch , an attempt by a film-maker to be more " literary " which instead suggests that he lacks the patience to reveal the characters' psychology without short-cuts . inventing the abbotts is a pleasant period drama for a while , until the episodic story grinds to a halt as the actors sit around waiting for the narrator to tell us how they feel . the opening half-hour of inventing the abbotts is by far its best , energized by the awkwardness and buzzing hormones of its teen-aged principal characters . it is jennifer connelly's funny , sexy and sly performance as eleanor which provides the real spark to the first act of abbotts , her every scene punctuated by a wicked smile , a glimpse of underwear ( her own ) or a grab of the crotch ( not her own ) . then , thirty minutes into the film , connelly is banished from the narrative , and the whole production goes into a stupor trying to figure out what its about . there are really two separate plot-lines in inventing the abbotts -- jacey's attempts to live vicariously through the abbotts and doug's off-and-on romance with pamela -- but once connelly is out of the picture , the episodic story is sluggish and rarely involving . the single predominant reason for that lack of involvement is the narration , provided by an uncredited michael keaton to underline the action whenever and wherever possible . it becomes ever more obtrusive as the film moves along , first providing merely background information but eventually announcing the motivations of every character . it is the narrator who tells us how jacey _really_ feels about alice , not billy crudup's performance ; it is the narrator who make sure we understand how wonderful mrs . holt is , not the interactions between the characters . and , as though aware that they are under no obligation to convey their emotions through anything as mundane as acting , the actors simply don't bother . joaquin phoenix and liv tyler -- who needs to learn a different emotional shade before she's too old to play " the virgin " -- make a perfectly nice couple , but neither delivers a personality . both are pleasant to look at , and they might as well be modeling for still photographs . given the way fox has marketed inventing the abbotts to focus on its " hot young stars , " it's not unreasonable to think of them as models in a story . it's not that they can't act ; they're simply not given much of a chance to do more than look as warm and inviting as the 1950s suburban middle-america director pat o'connor ( circle of friends ) creates . the audience isn't given much of a chance either , which ultimately may explain more of my dissatisfaction with inventing the abbotts . as artfully made and sensitively plotted as it might be , inventing the abbotts ends up insulting the audience with its over-reliance on narration . tv's " the wonder years " became a parody of itself when daniel stern piped up every forty seconds or so to clarify significant details which required absolutely no clarification , and that's the way inventing the abbotts feels after 108 minutes . when narration makes a film feel more lazy than literary , as happens in inventing the abbotts , it's time to shut up and follow the old writer's rule : show , don't tell . 
screenplay : tom schulman . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 93 minutes . is this the plot to weekend at bernie's iii . no , no , thank merciful god in heaven , no . the film in question is 8 heads in a duffel bag , and it's not nearly as awful as its plot or direct-to-video-style title might suggest . there area few moments of gruesome comic brilliance in 8 heads in a duffel bag , most of them involving the strange fates which continuously befall the heads . makeup artist greg cannom ( the mask ) does a delightful job of creating the heads , which keep turning up at inconvenient moments and end up providing the film's best scene during a sweet rendition of " mr . sandman . " when schulman is willing to push the limits of good taste , 8 heads in a duffel bag produces some big laughs , but he should have been willing to push those limits even further , and more often . for the first half of the film , charlie and the bennett family scream and fumble around in a posh mexican hotel in a strained manner , with newcomer comeau trying to carry the farce on his thin shoulders . he needs a lot more help than can be provided by dyan cannon and george hamilton , however ; their presence only serves to give you the feeling that you're watching a dark-humored episode of " the love boat . " while he has a bizarre and original plot device at his disposal , schulman inexplicably resorts to unpleasant mexican stereotypes , cannon's incessant shrieking and a parade of pratfalls . the great gag in pesci's scenes with spade and comeau is that he's much more simple and creative in the tortures he devises for his wimpy captives . it's a great , goofy spin on pesci's stock character , and it gives 8 heads some of its best moments . too bad only pesci seems to realize that fact . schulman actually doesn't seem to know what he wants to do with the characters , resulting sloppy and fairly pointless attempts at providing motivation . none of these snippets of personality amount to anything , however ; they're stock situations which don't even yield stock resolutions . schulman just lets his direction and script wander , getting terribly conventional at the oddest moments and pulling back when he should have been ready to go for the jugular . 8 heads in a duffel bag is just too uneven to be satisfying , even if some individual gags work to perfection . when you're throwing body parts at the audience , you've got to offer more than half-hearted whimsy . 
romy and michele's high school reunion isn't just a film _about_ two eras ; it's a film trapped _between_ two eras . first-time feature film director david mirkin is a veteran executive producer of tv's " the simpsons , " and there are times when romy and michele aims for a similar vein of absurdism and satire . at other times , it is nearly as formulaic and synthetic as the 1980s youth comedies spawned by the films of john hughes . romy and michele is a film with plenty of enjoyable bits and pieces , but it may actually hit its '80s nostalgia target a bit too well . for a while , it seems that romy and michele is going for a clueless sort of ditzy-hip vibe , with sorvino and kudrow sporting garish fashions by clueless designer mona may . may's costumes may by the most valuable player in romy and michele , providing reliable laughs every time we see the stars in a new pair of day-glo platform shoes or a new sausage-casing dress . sorvino and kudrow give satisfying performances , with kudrow straying little from her phoebe characterization from " friends , " but screenwriter robin schiff doesn't give them many good lines to work with . with few exceptions , the big laughs sorvino and kudrow draw are ones they earn through sheer exuberance ; even the fifth or sixth time michele responds to one of romy's observations with a gasp of " me too ! " the sluggish stretches in romy and michele come when schiff and mirkin take long breaks either for exposition flashbacks or fantasy sequences which aren't nearly as amusing as the scenes between the adult romy and michele . worse yet , the exposition serves primarily to set up the morals to the story , and romy and michele spends far too much time serving up more than the recommended daily allowance of reminders to " be yourself . " the comedy becomes terribly predictable at this point , with the last fifteen minutes of romy and michele's high school reunion turning into a succession of cues for us cheer the revenge of the nerds and silly moments of petty vengeance . romy and michele's high school reunion provides some solid belly laughs , but its overly-sincere observations about the high school social order rapidly become frustrating . with its soundtrack full of mid 80s early mtv " classics , " romy and michele is clearly aimed at those who are ready to do some reminiscing about their high school years , but instead of laughing at the absurdity of it all , mirkin and schiff provide what they must think is a necessary catharsis . romy and michele are entertaining characters , but they're in the wrong movie ; their obliviousness is more appealing than their self-awareness . while janeane garofolo provides a necessary dose of ironic distance , sorvino and kudrow are obliged to immerse themselves in a very retro sort of crowd-pleaser . individual moments are satisfying in romy and michele's high school reunion , but it doesn't trust its comic creations to carry the film without important messages . with its reminders of how tough we _all_ had it , regardless of our place on the teenage social ladder , all it really needs is the strident refrain of simple minds' " don't you forget about me " to make the cinematic flashback complete . 
the first five minutes of gray's anatomy are as squirm-inducing as any five minutes of film you'll see this year . in a series of black-and-white talking head interviews , people describe every possible horror which could befall the human eye , including close calls with super glue , aneurisms and inch-long shards of metal . though nothing is graphically depicted , the descriptions are detailed enough to give a surgeon chills . it's a sensational set-up for an examination of the fragility of vision ; if you've never worried about going blind before , you may be inspired to start . spalding gray had to worry about it , and for all i know it was very traumatic . that's certainly not the impression you get from gray's anatomy , however . gray is one of america's finest story-tellers , and some of the stories about native american sweat lodges and obsessive nutritionists are quite entertaining . but the story-telling is very detached ; gray's milieu is the ironic observation , not the soul-baring revelation . it's true that plenty of frightening things seem ridiculous with hindsight , but gray shows us all the ridiculousness with little of the fear . the whole ordeal seems more like an amusing inconvenience than an existential crisis . gray's anatomy feels even more detached because of the way director steven soderbergh has chosen to stage it . this is the third of gray's monologues to receive a film treatment , but it is the first to be filmed without a live audience . the advantage of that choice is that soderbergh is free to create a surreal mood with arresting visuals . the disadvantage is that gray seems adrift without an audience . he becomes a story-teller trying to be an actor , playing things too broadly in an attempt to generate the energy he can't draw from audience reaction . like fellow story-teller garrison keillor , gray's strength is a straightforward delivery which makes you laugh without _signaling_ you to laugh . gray's anatomy is like " a prairie home companion " turned into a performance art piece . they're just not a very good match for the creation of a film . soderbergh's direction creates an intensity of mood which gray's stoic demeanor can't sustain , and gray's ability to wow an audience while sitting in front of a microphone is undercut by soderbergh's visual theatrics . the absurdity of some of the stories in gray's anatomy is bound to generate some laughs , but while you're chuckling at the stories you may feel there's something missing , something the opening five minutes promises but doesn't deliver . in this case , the eyes just don't have it . 
screenplay : mike myers . producers : suzanne todd , demi moore , jennifer todd , mike myers . director : jay roach . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 87 minutes . not to 1967 , when i was a mere babe in arms , but to those carefree , halcyon days of 1990 . myers provided some moments of comic genius in those days , even as the show was developing this habit of allowing sketches to exceed their welcome by several excruciating minutes . i was reminded of both aspects of 1990-era " snl " as i watched austin powers : myers' appeal , and the inability to recognize when enough is enough . austin powers is a parody which could have run out of gas in seconds if myers had been interested only in late 60s anachronisms . as it turns out , there are relatively few gags based on the culture shock of the hero and the villain . for the most part , austin powers is a fairly straightforward parody of james bond-ian secret agent adventures , with gags more amusing than their obviousness gives them any right to be . myers energizes all these ideas with an odd-ball edge and the sheer exuberance of his performance in both roles . as long as austin powers feels vaguely original , and doesn't remind you of " saturday night live , " it's actually very funny . unfortunately , if you watched myers-era " snl " at all , it's going to look awfully familiar . he invokes his loud-mouthed thespian from " theater stories " in one early scene , and in another does a nearly word-for-word re-creation of a bit from a " wayne's world " sketch . he seems so enamored of invoking memories of " snl , " in fact , that he invokes nightmares of jokes which refuse to die . on at least five separate occasions , myers and director jay roach seem to have no sense of how long is too long to stick with an extended gag . they usually feel something like this : funny for five seconds , not funny for ten seconds , funny for five more seconds , not funny for eight and a half minutes . after so many begging-to-be-pulled-from-life-support sequences , austin powers feels like one of the most padded 87 minute movies you'll ever see . it didn't need to be . the early scenes set in 1967 are hilarious , including a goofy opening credits sequence and the promise of nice repartee between myers and mimi rogers as the emma peel-like mrs . kensington . every time " laugh-in " -style musical blackout segments appeared between scenes , i thought about how much funnier austin powers might have been as a pure period piece . it's the character of austin powers and the familiar plot elements from early james bond films which are most appealing about austin powers ; there was no particular need to put those elements in the 1990s . but that's what we've got : a comedy which jettisons a great premise for a merely adequate one . myers alone may be reason enough to watch austin powers if you are a fan of his " snl " glory days . there will be plenty of chances in the film to flash back to those days . . . and if you remember them at all , you know what a mixed blessing that could be . 
screenplay : rusty cundieff and darin scott . director : rusty cundieff . in 1993 , cundieff made his debut with a clever mock-documentary satire of the rap music scene called fear of a black hat . with sprung , it appears that cundieff has decided that he's not willing to wait until the next film to change genres -- he'll change genres right in the middle of a film . unfortunately , it's more of a collision than a fusion , with both halves getting dented in the process . for over half an hour , sprung bears a startling resemblance to another 1997 film about middle-class african-americans lookin' for a little somethin' : booty call . sprung may be a bit more focused thanks to a more condensed time frame , but the familiarity is inescapable . in some cases , like a hilarious moment based on facial expressions of pleasure , that familiarity is welcome . in others , like the depressingly predictable appearance of a mincing gay stereotype for a cheap laugh , it is entirely unwelcome . of course , booty call was out too recently for cundieff to be guilty of intentionally stealing booty . the same situation applies when sprung suddenly takes a radical shift in tone to resemble a different 1997 film about middle-class african-americans lookin' for a different kind of somethin' : love jones . as the relationship between montel and brandy turns into a combination of soft-focus montage and tasteful black-and-white photography , sprung becomes an attempt at a straight-up love story which generally falls flat . montel and brandy aren't exactly characters -- they're just nice people who exist primarily to give the colorful clyde an adina targets for their mischief . though cundieff doesn't abandon the broad comedy entirely , he cuts back radically enough that you realize the broad comedy was the best thing sprung had going for it . as a love story , it's pretty limp stuff . sprung also shows that cundieff still prefers not to stray far from the satirical ground of fear of a black hat and tales from the hood . when working with the boundaries of a specific genre's conventions , cundieff knows just where to step to get a laugh . sprung just isn't tightly structured enough to allow him to show his stuff . it also requires him to create three-dimensional characters for the first time , a task at which he doesn't seem particularly adept ; he's more comfortable with the ridiculous than with the sublime . there will be other opportunities for the young and talented cundieff to master the more subtle skills of film-making , however . after all , he still has to do a historical epic , a violent caper film and an intimate family drama . 
screenplay : david koepp , based on the novel by michael crichton . director : steven spielberg . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , violence ) running time : 127 minutes . sure , the lizards in question were not entirely mechanical , but i got the point . it also turns out to be , more or less , more of the same . the lost world offers all the shallow characterization and pointless plotting of jurassic park without the sense of discovery . only in the hands of steven spielberg could that recipe add up to something moderately diverting instead of a compete disaster . in many ways , the lost world is actually an improvement over jurassic park , if for no other reason than that it is more honest . spielberg takes exactly two minutes to show us the first dinosaur in the lost world , clearly aware that there's no point in creating build-up any longer . he also takes a note from a clever line in david koepp's script given to malcolm : " yeah , ooh ahh . . . that's always how it starts . jurassic park was almost obliged to provide the wide-eyed wonder of the completely new ; the lost world , appropriately , delivers a much higher ratio of " running and screaming " to " ooh ahh . " it also doesn't have laura dern as a dumber-than-triceratops-dung paleobotanist , giggling like a schoolgirl over malcolm's description of chaos theory , or ariana richards shrieking about unix systems . what the lost world _does_ have is a generous helping of scenes and characters which are awfully familiar . pete postlethwaite plays this year's version of the great white hunter while arliss howard plays this year's version of the corporate scum ; the gallimimus stampede of jp becomes lost world's parasauralophus stampede . even the sequence of attacks feels derivative : t . rex attacks a vehicle and tries to push it over a cliff , t . rex chases people , people trek toward a distant goal , velociraptors take their turn . jurassic park was more enjoyable than it should have been because we had never seen this stuff before . lost world is the same stuff , just in greater quantities . those greater quantities are probably going to satisfy movie-goers who like their action fast and furious , with minimal interruption for silly little things like character development . no one will argue that that the lost world is much more than a string of set pieces ; there is also little question that a few of those set pieces are directed with that indescribable spielberg something . when spielberg is " on , " the results can be dizzying , and he's " on " just often enough to give the lost world a few satisfying sparks . like us , he's been there and done that . i believe i have seen jurassic park four times since its initial release , and i have enjoyed it less each time . if i had seen the lost world for the first time in 1993 -- if the order of the two films had been reversed -- i suspect i would have found it positively thrilling . in 1997 , it's just like watching jurassic park for the fifth time , when it's hard to get worked up over a film which has little going for it besides big mechanical lizards . 
appropriately enough , that's the way the van wanders along as a narrative . the previous installments in author roddy doyle's barrytown trilogy -- alan parker's 1991 the commitments and frears' own 1994 adaptation of the snapper -- each provided an anchoring element for doyle's humorous episodes and colorful characters . instead of the commitments' energetic musical numbers or the snapper's sweet father-daughter relationship , the van offers under-developed nods to the embarrassment of unemployment and nationalist pride in the irish world cup team . one or two at a time , it's amusing to take in such " honey , you won't believe the day i had " tales . over the course of an hour and a half , the anecdotes grow a bit wearying . the van is certainly the least effective of the three cinematic barrytown tales , yet it is still manages to provide some high-spirited entertainment . most of the credit goes to meany and o'kelly , a pair of appealing protagonists who lend a flustered enthusiasm to most of their scenes . the humor comes as much from reaction as it does from situation in the van , with meany able to sell small moments like his very logical reaction to a customer who comes up 10 pence short for his burger ( meany takes a 10-pence bite before handing over the food ) . when the van does pay off with a big laugh , it makes you realize that it might have been great fun to watch these same characters in a more consistent story . instead , we have a cinematic snack truck , offering a few tasty bites rather than a truly satisfying meal . 
even by the standards of independent cinema , dream with the fishes is a tough film to categorize . at times , writer/director finn taylor's debut feature is edgy and tough-talking ; at other times , it's a surreal odyssey ; at still other times , it's a sensitive drama of male bonding . it's a genuinely bizarre experience , something akin to watching brian's song as it might be re-made by abel ferrara and gus van sant . genuinely bizarre film experiences are rare enough that dream with the fishes should have been commendable on that count alone . those introductory scenes between nick and terry are the best dream with the fishes has to offer , maintaining a sense of mystery and a dangerous tension between the characters . nick , the hustler ( a sharp , eye-catching performance by hunt ) , seems to be working some kind of long con ; terry , the miserable voyeur , could be unstable enough to be far more trouble than nick expects from a guy in a tie . then , of all the posible things he could do with the characters next , taylor does perhaps the least interesting : he turns them into mis-matched buddies . all sense of invention , the life-blood of independent film-making , dissolves into inevitable pathos . taylor could have taken the characters in dream with the fishes and sent them off on a hyper-violent crime spree , or had them sit around for ninety minutes comparing notes on generational angst . it's a pleasant surprise that he does neither , but his resolution to this story is neither particularly pleasant nor particularly surprising . if there's one way i never expected dream with the fishes to end , it was with a life-affirming scattering of ashes . it's the ending to a made-for-lifetime movie with a testosterone twist . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
don't make the mistake of assuming that " 187 " is gritty , urban classroom drama in the mold of dangerous minds . but this story isn't about the amazing power of dedicated teachers to effect change in the face of socio-economic hardships and an oppressive tie-in soundtrack . " 187 " is a horror movie . at least that's what it _should_ have been . for most of the time he is on the screen , jackson generates a tension which threatens to explode at any moment . his performance is raw and haunting , like a priest experiencing a crisis of faith . credit jackson with an insight screenwriter scott yagemann and director kevin reynolds both lack . yagemann's script -- full to bursting with good teachers ( kelly rowan ) and bad teachers ( john heard ) , good students ( karina arroyave ) and bad students -- fairly yanks the outrage out of us with pliers , dwelling on the unconscionable conditions and trite confrontations . reynolds , meanwhile , perhaps in an attempt to create an atmosphere of surreality , opens up the film school grab-bag -- dizzying 360 degree tracking shots , blurred focus , black-and-white video footage , jittery hand-held camera work , slow motion , rust-tinged cinematography . it is a dreadfully misguided choice . every flashy gimmick proves distancing and distracting , pulling us away from the painful reality of garfield's life . it's clear that the makers of " 187 " want to leave viewers angry and frustrated . and they succeed , though not in the way they intended . we don't need another film to drag us into the classroom to show us how bad things are . we don't need another film to lecture to us , or to try to impress us with cinematic puffery . only in a riveting climax do we ever get a chance to see garfield in his darkest moments , as reynolds and yagemann create a pointless did-he-or-didn't-he mystery . this could have been the urban high school film which has been begging to be made for years , one which avoids inanely and simplistically describing that world as " gritty " or " tough . " the appropriate word is " terrifying . " the appropriate mood is horror . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
given a classic action-comedy premise , gibson makes what would seem to be a rational acting choice : he gives a classic action-comedy performance . for about half the film , gibson is an oddball delight . what a waste . by all evidence , no one besides gibson involved in conspiracy theory realized that it was an action-comedy . exit slick , simple plot , enter a muddle of dark experiments and indecipherable connections between characters who never even appear in the film . the latter choice is ill-advised bordering on inexcusable . like the professional that he is , gibson sobs dutifully through the scenes of jerry at the end of his tether , spewing forth exposition between squints and grimaces , but it's clear he'd much rather be goofy than grandiose . it's easy to laugh at jerry when gibson is playing him for laughs , because there's no sense that he's genuinely mentally ill ; he's just a man who thinks he knows something who becomes a man who knew too much . every bit of fun jerry provides suddenly becomes vaguely tainted . you start to feel as though you really should be feeling sorry for him instead of laughing at him . that fun is desperately missed through much of conspiracy theory , because it turns into a very long sit . as the conspiracies pile up and the chases become a blur over two hours and fifteen minutes , gibson's sharp line readings act like electrical paddles to the film's heart . after four previous films together , you'd think that gibson and donner could find themselves on the same page . no such luck . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
sure , it's easy to take cynical swipes at family entertainment , especially formulaic family entertainment like free willy 3 . and perhaps it deserves better . all that , and not once does anyone get kicked in the groin or break wind . but family audiences deserve better , too . they shouldn't have to settle for merely competent film-making like free willy 3 simply because it's less noxious than the alternatives . every one of the things free willy 3 has going for it is something the delightful shiloh also managed to do -- and do better -- without making the villain so predictable he refers to whales as " fish , " or padding the running time with several minutes of second unit nature footage . there is nothing actively insulting , offensive or annoying about free willy 3 . there is nothing actively entertaining or enriching about it , either , unless it is to learn the sheer tonnage of blood which accompanies the birth of a baby orca . certain self-appointed guardians of cinematic morality have pronounced that american parents are clamoring for worthy films to show their children . i'm still waiting for the din to reach my ears . i certainly didn't hear anyone clamoring for yet another free willy film , especially after the over-plotted and half-baked free willy 2 . it's too easy for parents to settle , too easy for producers to give parents as much as they will tolerate and nothing more . welcome home . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
that notion explains a lot about how the film incarnation of leave it to beaver ended up as it did . i don't remember ward as a well-intentioned but emotionally immature doofus . the central character of leave it to beaver isn't really theodore " beaver " cleaver ( newcomer cameron finley ) , or his older brother wally ( erik von detten ) , and certainly not june ( janine turner ) . he's too busy damaging the lad's self-esteem by creating unrealistic expectations and appearing judgmental . and it's too bad , because there's a silly , innocent quality to leave it to beaver which makes it better than you'd expect from yet another tv retread . the comedy comes from the kind of predictably broad slapstick common in most contemporary comedies for kids , but it's blessedly free of toilet gags and exaggerated mayhem . brian levant and lon diamond's script ( levant worked on the syndicated " the new leave it to beaver " series in the 80s ) is often surprisingly clever , and even more surprisingly clean . the performances are sit-com simple yet mostly appealing , particularly that of the agreeably adorable cameron finley . it's obvious that leave it to beaver isn't meant to court the nostalgia audience , unless it is through the inclusion of barbara billingsley ( the original june ) and ken osmond ( the original eddie haskell ) in cameos . those viewers might actually enjoy seeing the cleavers portrayed as a healthy and happy family , rather than just another dysfunction waiting to happen . this leave it to beaver is unabashedly 90s in a fairly depressing way : it takes paternal incompetence as a given . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
that should have been the idea , anyway . the edge is a wilderness adventure which also wants to be a psychological drama , but forgets to develop a convincing conflict between the two leads . in fact , there are precious few screen minutes of any kind between charles and bob before the are stuck together . for the most part , antagonism between charles and bob is presented as a given . after all , there's a beautiful woman involved , envy of wealth , stressful situations . . . what's not to be antagonistic over ? for one thing , the situations aren't all that stressful , thanks to an inherent lack of tension in the characters . every trivial piece of information he has ever read has become part of his photographic memory , making him a walking encyclopedia of primitive anthropology , basic physics , first aid , forestry , engineering and alternative cures for side-aches . as you watch charles fashion a compass from a magnetized pin and a floating leaf , or construct a squirrel trap from bent twigs , or go fishing with a thread from his sweater and a watch fob , you get the distinct impression that you're watching a portrait of macgyver as an older man . there's no reason to be worried about whether charles will make it . and it's too bad that there isn't more drama to the characters in the edge , because in concept and execution it's often a thrilling adventure . director lee tamahori ( once were warriors ) crafts some fine action sequences , notably those involving the survivors' ongoing battle with a mythically persistent man-eating bear . as photographed by donald mcalpine , the edge is a satisfying experience both visually and viscerally . intellectually , it's an ambitious disappointment . stories set in the wild usually assume that returning to a state of nature is the only way a human can survive away from civilization , which makes it refreshing to find a story which assumes that reason is an even more effective survival tool . it's particularly surprising that the writer is mamet , who has been known to have his characters turn animalistic while sitting at a desk . ( which isn't to say that you can't spot a bit of cynicism creeping in -- it's hard to believe that he named his supermodel character " mickey morse " by accident ) . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
director : jim gillespie . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence ) running time : 100 minutes . screenwriter kevin williamson helped make dimension films a mint on last year's smash hit scream by demonstrating that he understood the " rules " of horror film plots . you know the ones : never have pre-marital sex , never say " i'll be right back , " never let the killer chase you up the stairs . williamson's self-aware slasher film tickled the funny bones of genre buffs , but scream didn't work only as a satire . it was an effective horror film in its own right because director wes craven understood that , even more important than the rules for being a character in a horror film , you've got to know the rules for _making_ a horror film . i know what you did last summer was also penned by williamson ( from a popular novel by lois duncan ) , but its success is more scattershot than scream's . at times , it's a potent and effective chiller ; at other times , it's fairly uninspired . when the rules are firmly in place , i know what you did stays mostly on track . to wit : 1 ) establish a fundamentally sound premise . unlike most horror films , i know what you did doesn't just send a psycho on a random killing spree . that set-up requires a bit of mystery and a bit of creativity , and williamson does a decent job of providing them . which doesn't mean that he should have made the film a mystery , because . . . 2 ) whodunnit don't matter . a horror film is under no obligation to tease the audience as to the killer's identity ; freddy krueger and michael myers did plenty of damage with the audience on a first-name basis . i know what you did goes to great lengths to make that question important -- all the characters are preoccupied with it , suspects pop up at regular intervals , and the finale seems built around an eventual unmasking , all of which makes it perplexing that the script never gives you a chance to guess who the killer is . it's also disappointing to find the menacing slicker-clad maniac -- you may never trust the gorton's fisherman in the same way again -- turn into just some person with a grudge and an ice hook for the final reel . williamson could have done better than a scooby-doo resolution to a scary film . which points why it's important to . . . much of the exposition in i know what you did -- and there's a bit too much of it -- frames the story as a psychological mystery , with plenty of guilty confessions and attempts to investigate who wants to do in our protagonists . then , a few minutes will pass and someone will end up with an ice hook inconveniently lodged in his or her carotid artery . williamson and gillespie often seem to be scrambling for an r rating , when they could have made just as effective a film with a pg-13 . i know what you did didn't have to be a horror film to be scary , as long as the makers understood rule #4 . . . any hack with a mixing board can freak out an audience with a burst of loud music . it takes considerably more style to build up an audience for a scare , then scare them anyway . director jim gillespie stages a few exceptionally creepy set pieces , building suspense which lasts a lot longer than the two seconds it takes for someone to leap into frame . and speaking of anti-climaxes . . . 5 ) try to finish with your best stuff . the ship-board finale is a solid piece of film-making , but the unmasked villain doesn't quite cut an imposing figure . once again i know what you did last summer appears to suffer from an identity crisis ; much of the last reel could have come from any of a dozen crime thrillers . perhaps that's why gillespie and williamson have so much trouble following the rules of horror film-making . it's only every so often that they seem convinced they're actually making a horror film . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
the first half of mike figgis' one night stand contains some of the most effective film-making moments to hit american screens this year , yet even at the outset it's obvious that figgis isn't working at his sharpest . it's a lazy narrative device which allows figgis five minutes of screen time to re-hash the press notes before allowing max to finish with a portentous " we'll see what happens . " what happens , at least for nearly an hour , is a marvelously detailed portrait of an isolated infidelity and what it means to a man's life . the scenes between max and karen are tantalizing , but they're also risky , since figgis is showing us an act of adultery without first providing much context to build sympathy for the characters . the two sex scenes in one night stand are probably the most disparate i've seen in a single film , and the most uniquely effective . in part , the casting of snipes in the lead role is responsible . snipes is a reliable performer , but he never seems entirely in touch with this character . to be fair , figgis has written the part as the most guilt-wracked , angst-filled and introspective soul this side of hamlet . there are a couple of solid moments between snipes and downey ( affecting and acerbic as the terminally ill charlie ) , but at a certain point , 45 minutes in anticipation of a life-changing revelation feels like about 30 minutes too many . the blame for that belongs entirely with figgis , who can't hold the level of interest built by the film's first half . at turns he opts either to tell too much ( in snipes' opening monologue ) or too little ( in most of the second hour ) . it's a story which hints and teases , then offers a resolution which asks for a tremendous leap of faith as to the compatibility of certain characters . what begins as honest and probing turns sluggish , predictable and coy . snipes as the melancholy dane isn't the stuff of which great drama is made . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
director : jon amiel . mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , adult themes , mild violence ) running time : 92 minutes . at last we can answer the question that has plagued movie-goers for ages : what would the pink panther films have been like if bill murray had played inspector clouseau ? all right , perhaps " plagued " is too strong a word . in fact , it's likely that no one has ever asked the question , probably because the answer seemed obvious . clouseau was similarly convinced ; he was also thoroughly self-deluding . playing clouseau would require murray to play dumb with complete earnestness . could he really stop winking self-knowingly long enough for us to buy him as an idiot ? the answer , unfortunately , is not really . the man who knew too little is a de facto clouseau premise , casting murray as a schlub named wallace ritchie whose unreasonable dreams of acting prowess have been diverted into working at a blockbuster video in des moines , iowa . though the comedic mistaken-identity premise is sporting more than a few gray whiskers , it can still work with the right lead performer . murray is a wonderful comic actor , the kind who can turn a simple reaction take into a monster laugh , but he is at his best when asked to stand outside the action and comment on its absurdity . eventually , the premise begins to feel like an elaborate waste of murray's time . ironically , the man who knew too little is still at its funniest when it just lets murray be murray . his off-hand quips are frequently good for a chuckle , providing goofy running commentary on the overly elaborate silliness of secret agent capers . they're also entirely out of place for his character . murray is sharper than this concept , and he shows it by spending most of his time looking for gags in all the wrong places , fighting against the premise instead of trying to make it work . there are a few worth-while moments for the supporting cast , notably alfred molina as a russian agent who develops a grudging respect for his " brilliant " american adversary , which show signs of life in a generally under-whelming script . for the most part , the man who knew too little is a less-than-stellar episode of the bill murray show , sporadically amusing when it doesn't burden the top attraction with an over-stuffed plot -- german businessmen , british and russian secret agents , a hooker-with-a-heart-and-wardrobe-of-gold , exploding matryoshka dolls , and what the mcguffin was going on with those carefully tied letters everyone gets so worked up over ? -- ill-suited to his talents . it all adds up to more stuff for murray to smirk at , in a role where smirking should have been strictly prohibited . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : joss whedon . director : jean-pierre jeunet . mpaa rating : r ( violence , gore , profanity , brief nudity ) running time : 109 minutes . i'm sure that someone could -- and will -- come up with an explanation for all the pseudo-science involved in the premise for alien resurrection . i'm sure there is some reason why that same cloning process turned ripley into a human/alien hybrid with memories of her previous life . i'm sure there's some reason why the same alien queen which had been producing eggs could suddenly become viviparous . i'm sure there is some reason why i should be able to yank " willing suspension of disbelief " from the jaws of " oh , _please_ . " the thing is , alien resurrection didn't give me much reason to care about what those reasons might be . and that would be the same ripley who became an action icon in three previous films , not the vaguely sinister approximation served up here . all the effort to make ripley's return " realistic " still adds up to a cargo hold full of question marks and an emotional vacuum at the film's center . call me crazy , but if a writer's going to push the limits of credulity , i'd prefer him to say , " alien3 was just a dream . director jean-pierre jeunet ( delicatessen , city of lost children ) has a genuine visual flair which inspires some sharp sequences , notably an underwater escape for our protagonists which leads into an alien trap . unfortunately , he devotes most of his creative energy to coming up with new and innovative ways for the aliens to treat the heads of their victims like unsightly facial blemishes . alien resurrection is frequently a bath of viscera , a collection of graphic deaths rendered in glorious , gratuitous detail . it all contributes to the impression that alien resurrection is a " moment " film -- a bunch of neat ideas for individual scenes so impersonally rendered that they never add up to a coherent narrative . as a film , it's never boring , featuring a typically whacked-out performance by brad dourif as one of the scientists , a clever instance of alien teamwork and self-sacrifice , and a potent encounter between ripley and a laboratory full of abominations . it's also never compelling in a way we should expect when a character has this much cinematic history . by the time its climactic confrontation rolls around -- involving a creature resembling the evil doppleganger of the pillsbury doughboy -- alien resurrection has become flat-out ridiculous , a big violent joke at the expense of viewers expecting a real story about ellen ripley . i can't see most fans of the series walking away from this experience satisfied . more likely , the'll walk away muttering , " oh , _please_ .

terms of endearment was a crowd-pleasing tear-jerker buoyed by smart comedy and rich characterizations ; broadcast news brought a throwback romantic comedy sensibility to an upscale study of journalistic ethics with an unexpectedly down-beat conclusion . even the notorious little musical that wasn't i'll do anything demonstrated brooks' willingness to cut bait when he knew the audience had no interest in what he was offering . as good as it gets had the potential for a classic written all over it . for once , however , brooks doesn't have a grip on how best to handle his material . he takes 90 minutes of great material and drags it out over nearly two and a half hours . it didn't have to be like that . as good as it gets has a wonderful character at its center , a truly horrible human being named melvin udall ( nicholson ) . it's an admirable theme for a film , this notion of a man deciding to change himself when he realizes the effect those changes have on other people . the pre-conversion melvin is an outrageous delight , getting away with hateful rantings few other characters could without inspiring protests . his growth as a character saps him of all his bad-boy energy , leaving in its place a tricky romance with hunt which somehow works even with nicholson perpetually looking like he's straining at the end of a leash . that romance might have been even more effective if brooks had kept his attention fixed on how melvin and carol are so good and so bad for each other . yet there's always simon there in the background , a distracting tangent the lightweight kinnear can't invest with sufficient gravity . his story adds little but the adorably grungy verdell , a couple of showboating scenes for cuba gooding jr . as a fuming art dealer , and a lot of padding to an already over-long film . brooks is too adept with a witty line to turn out a tedious film , and nicholson and hunt too capable to fumble the well-rounded characterizations . as good as it gets simply turns out to be a rare case of brooks failing to ride what works for all it's worth . it's funny but fitful , because we know this isn't as good as a james l . brooks film gets . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : woody allen . director : woody allen . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , nudity , adult themes ) running time : 95 minutes . woody allen spends 95 minutes blurring the lines between life and art in deconstructing harry . throughout the film , we get a chance to see harry's autobiographical tales brought to life , with different actors playing the roles of various individuals in his life -- julia louis-dreyfuss as one-time lover judy davis , demi moore as second wife kirstie alley , and so on . it's a fairly successful conceit , one which allows allen to take off on some extremely funny flights of fancy . allen has plenty of fun with the narrative device , but that same device also points out one major casting problem in deconstructing harry : with all the surrogate role-playing going on , allen should have found someone else to play harry block . in part , it's because the levels of self-referentiality become wearying . more to the point , allen isn't deft enough as an actor -- or ego-less enough as a director -- to make harry truly repugnant . in order for us to take deconstructing harry seriously as allen's acknowledgement that art does not forgive all , harry needs to be more than a pathetic little nebbish . another actor might have given harry's misogynistic rantings and rationalizations genuine bite ; allen's desperate need to be accepted and understood bathes his every moment on screen in apologetic blandness . of course , it's just as easy to read deconstructing harry as allen's argument that art _does_ forgive all . and in some ways , the film is its own best argument , teasing the audience with goofy entertainment whenever it's not making half-hearted attempts to dig into harry's psyche . perhaps it does matter to some viewers whether or not allen is a horrible human being with a morally reprehensible personal life . me , i'll settle for being treated to a bunch of laughs once a year . deconstructing harry is as effective in its comedy as it is distracting in its self-absorption , blurring the line between life and art just enough to make you wish allen could blur it a bit more . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
i've gotta admit , i have a real hard time taking adam sandler seriously as a romantic leading man . and apparently i'm not alone in that respect -- sandler himself seems to be having a real hard time taking himself seriously as a romantic leading man throughout the wedding singer . it's surprising and refreshing to watch a performer like sandler try to stretch himself after a string of roles which required him either to scream , destroy things or scream while destroying things . it's also a bit goofy . i was surprised not to find an out-take reel over the closing credits of the wedding singer , since it looked like dozens of takes must have ended with sandler in the middle of a massive giggle fit . it's a good thing that the pleasant but improbable romance doesn't have to carry the wedding singer . the real star of the show is the mid-80s milieu -- a soundtrack full of the era's one-hit wonders pop tunes , thread-perfect costuming by mona may ( clueless ) , knowing references to the eventual breakup of van halen and several famous couples . in fact , the wedding singer is one of the more consistently chuckle-filled comedies of the last several months . though never out-and-out hilarious or inspired , tim herlihy's script ( with uncredited assist from carrie fisher , among others ) gets solid mileage out of its kitschy atmosphere , lively cameos by steve buscemi , jon lovitz and billy idol ( as himself ) , and one priceless moment involving a string quartet's solemn rendition of journey's " don't stop believin' . " even drew barrymore acquits herself admirably in the uncommon role of the " nice girl . " still , there's something ever-so-slightly askew about adam sandler trying to get away with the hushed tones and puppy-dog eyes of a sensitive , relationship kinda guy . he may be an actor some day , but he's not there yet ; he's still primarily a happy-go-lucky anarchist with a talent for silly voices and even sillier songs . robby's performance scenes are certainly where sandler seems most comfortable , particularly as he tears into a diatribe against his ex or a lyrically amusing ode to growing old with julia . when he steps off the stage and into his best faux john cusack , it just looks like it's all he can do to keep a straight face . the wedding singer turns out to be an entertaining way to spend 90 minutes laughing at the past . in a different way , it may be just as funny watching sandler spend 90 minutes laughing at an alternative future . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : robert benton and richard russo . producers : arlene donovan and scott rudin . director : robert benton . mpaa rating : r ( brief nudity , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 91 minutes . i suspect that there was a great deal of good feeling on the set of twilight , the kind that comes when people believe they're about to make a point . after all , this would be a film where the title could be interpreted two ways . on the other hand , it would describe the cast of veteran actors and the charactes they play , all trying to show they are just as vital in the present as they were in the past . it would be a sly , subtle story brought to life by a group of sly , subtle performers . perhaps too sly and subtle for its own good . as a narrative , twilight offers virtually nothing you haven't seen in a dozen other mysteries set among southern california's privileged set : dirty cops , friends who turn out to be enemies , enemies who turn out to be friends , wads of cash exchanging hands , a little rough stuff , a little gratuitous nudity . sub-plots and supporting characters materialize with alarming frequency , far too many to be fleshed out adequately in the lean 91 minutes provided by robert benton and richard russo's script . twilight introduces enough ideas about decaying affluence and influence that it always seems to be moving forward . it just doesn't feel like it's headed anywhere in particular . the only reason twilight doesn't feel like a thoroughly generic time-waster -- and in fact offers a moderate level of satisfaction -- is the pleasure which comes from watching great actors share the screen . newman wears the layers of disappointment in harry's cop-turned-shamus-turned-drunk life like an old sweater , yet maintains a core of idealistic morality . kramer , nobody's fool ) in his typical restrained style . in fact , the actors are so good that they might trick you into thinking you're watching well-rounded characters . it's only when reese witherspoon , liev schreiber and giancarlo esposito stumble over their underdeveloped parts that it becomes apparent how sketchy those characters truly are . twilight generally feels rushed together as an opportunity for all these actors to appear in a movie together ; for all the talking going on , it's tough to get a handle on who these people really are . there's a fair amount of sharp , tart dialogue to go around . unfortunately , not enough of it is used to bring the characters into focus . harry laughs richly at the rumor when he learns of it , but the film may take the idea a bit more seriously . it's intriguing to watch both the actors and the characters trying to re-define themselves in the present and put their past behind them . and maybe that's even enough subtext to give twilight the edge it needs to make up for its lack of actual text . the story may be only half-finished , but the stars sure aren't . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : joel coen and ethan coen . director : joel coen . while the grinding predictability of most american films challenges a writer to generate one more coherent thought than the film itself , coen efforts like miller's crossing , barton fink and fargo burst from the screen like doctoral theses waiting to be written , sending cinema scribes scrambling gleefully for a thesaurus . the bizarre supporting characters pinwheeling through their films could be glossed as metaphorical proto-fascists or subversions of traditional genre types ; their apparently stream-of-conscious narratives could reveal clockwork structure . oh , what happy hours could be spent fine tuning analyses fit for literary journals as we hurtled towards our deadlines . i spent most of the car ride home from the big lebowski -- and a fair chunk of time afterward -- spelunking for themes , tropes and symbols . the time frame of gulf war-era 1991 was certainly meant to place the story squarely in the twilight of the reagan/bush go-go 1980s . mix in the " big " lebowski's feminist avant-garde artiste daughter maude ( julianne moore ) , ironic allusions to political correctness and a few swipes at the boot-straps rhetoric of the well-to-do , and clearly you have a satire of the ordinary joe ( or jeff ) unwittingly fighting to make the world safe for republicanism . right ? it was so much fun deconstructing the big lebowski after the fact that i started trying to convince myself i had had as much fun watching it . the reason it's not more fun , despite a blissful singularity of vision which always keeps you watching , is that the coens seem to take the same approach to making their films that we critics take to analyzing them . they're not stories as much as they are intellectual and aesthetic calistheics , films which make you work hard enough that you have to convince yourself you're getting something out of them . joel and ethan's encyclopedic knowledge of genre conventions and film expectations allow them to understand exactly when to yank the rug , but in the big lebowski they fall into the same trap which hampered the hudsucker proxy : they create so much distance from the characters that you're left with congratulating yourself because you got the joke . if you're willing to surrender yourself to the coens' characteristic oddball flourishes , you certainly won't walk away from the big lebowski disgusted . second-tier coen fare is still better than most of what's out there ; it's hard not to take some pleasure in a film which includes among its antagonists a trio of marmot-wielding nihilists , or clothes a meek bowling buddy named donny ( steve buscemi ) in a succession of bowling shirts bearing every possible name _but_ donny . it's just disappointing watching the coens retreat into layers of irony once you've seen what happens in a film like fargo when they're willing to humanize their phenomenal film-making talent . as undeniably amusing as many of the big leboswki's oddball flourishes are , the film is almost nothing _but_ oddball flourishes , wandering along with a theme or two in tow . bad news for those in search of accessible comedy ; good news , as always , for those who work at finding oddball flourishes and well-disguised social commentary . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : akiva goldsman . producers : akiva goldsman , stephen hopkins and mark w . koch . director : stephen hopkins . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , violence , profanity ) running time : 130 minutes . boy it seems like summer in the american movie business is starting earlier all the time , doesn't it ? time was you had to wait at least until memorial day for the first sighting of a big-budget blockbuster . yep , summer is coming earlier all the time . and so is the holiday movie season for that matter . correct me if i'm wrong , but isn't the new star trek movie not due until november ? the premise is something straight out of the current tv " trek " incarnation " voyager , " but that's not the only place that akiva goldsman's script borders on " trek " parody . even the extra-terrestrial sets have the vaguely cheesy early styrofoam look of the original series . then again , " star trek " never got itself bogged down in the sort of hand-wringing which passes for character development in lost in space . and one bitchin'-cool loud and busy story , at that . lost in space may be silly and overwrought , but it sure looks great . creepy creatures , spaceship dogfights , morphing , nifty costumes , well-crafted action sequences -- i can't remember the last time i spent so much time impressed by a film's bag of visual tricks . there's even a modicum of decent acting to season the spectacle , particularly from oldman as the nasty villain and leblanc as the thick-but-decent military man . there may not be much to recommend lost in space as quality film-making beyond its technical prowess , but that's probably more than enough to satisfy summer movie fans until summer actually arrives . or to satisfy the " star trek " fans until thanksgiving actually arrives . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : laurie craig . director : john roberts . mpaa rating : pg ( mild profanity , adult humor ) running time : 90 minutes . even before i was a film critic , i was a studio marketing executive's worst nightmare . the standard for selling films has long been to provide an easy frame of reference for the potential viewer , some comparison to a well-known and well-liked predecessor to latch on to . " from the director of independence day " one ad might trumpet , while another features a critical comment that the film is " the best romance since ghost . " such tactics have long left me skeptical , fearing yet another bandwagon-riding copycat rather than looking forward to something with enough substance or style to stand on its own . in my heart , i know paulie is an attempt to cash in on the family film success of recent talking animal pictures like babe and homeward bound . if your first instinct is to think of paulie as a dopey rip-off , be prepared for a pleasant surprise . paulie may never reach the enchanting heights of babe , but it's consistently charming in its own low-key way . though the adventures are basic and sometimes silly , they are accompanied by lessons gently taught . simple stuff , to be sure , but more edifying family fare than a dozen recent disney films put together . more generally , paulie is a family film which doesn't begin with the assumption that young audiences respond only to stupidity . with the exception of a token instance of flatulence humor and a few coarse insults , scripter laurie craig keeps the gags above the belt , opting to use animal tricks and verbal sparring for amusement . jay mohr's paulie is an obvious hommage to buddy hackett ( obvious enough that hackett shows up in a cameo ) , but he creates just enough feisty personality to make the bird's story matter without making him annoying . paulie also features an unusually strong cast , headed by a grandmotherly rowlands and the always appealing shalhoub ( adding a russian accent to his nationality of the week repertoire ) . this is one feature parents and kids will be able to sit through together with smiles on every face . it would be easy to embrace paulie excessively simply because it doesn't crash into a pile of singed green feathers the way you might expect . in fact , it's hardly a classic-in-the-making . most disappointing of all is a conclusion which leaves us with an odd romantic pairing as its happy ending . it's an uneven effort , but it's satisfying to note that it's actually an _effort_ . paulie could have cruised along on talking animals and foolishness ; instead , it tells a story of friendship and good manners with a few sharp jokes . how nice to find a fun bit of entertainment , and not just " the best talking animal movie since babe .

mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 108 minutes . everything i needed to know about the themes of the butcher boy , it turns out , i learned from the opening titles sequence . but it's not just family strife which eventually turns francie into a monster . there is a perverse fascination to watching francie grow progressively more demented , but eventually it becomes clear that there's not much more to the butcher boy than that . it's tough to work up much sympathy for francie when he's treated by co-writer and director neil jordan like a lab rat in a grand sociological experiment -- how much hate and violence can one boy absorb until he snaps ? for a story on a serious subject , it's not always easy to take the butcher boy seriously . then again , it's pretty clear that jordan isn't interested in having us take it seriously . the butcher boy is a truly odd black-humored concoction which treats francie's many traumas with more whimsy than consternation . jordan's approach is consistently surprising , taking even a tired device like omnipresent voice-over narration ( also provided by rea as the adult francie ) and turning it into a bizarre duet between past and present . with elliot goldenthal providing a jaunty underscore to everything from youthful play to the discovery of a murder scene , the butcher boy remains strangely amusing enough to keep you watching . that , unfortunately , is about as far as jordan goes . as a comedy , it's a fairly original collection of sick chuckles . as a drama , it offers pat answers and too little insight , putting us through episodic paces without offering more to learn about its main character than we learned from the first 90 seconds or so : keep your boys away from television and comic books unless you want them going crazy on you . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
written , produced and directed by nick broomfield . mpaa rating : unrated ( could be r for profanity , nudity and adult themes ) running time : 97 minutes . by the end of nick broomfield's controversy-plagued documentary kurt & courtney , i think i knew as much about broomfield himself as i knew about kurt cobain or courtney love . the film might have begun as a biographical study , exploring the tempestuous tives of nirvana lead singer cobain and riot grrrl-cum-actress love both before and after their 1992 marriage , but that's not the story it ends up telling . instead , it becomes the tale of broomfield's ongoing battle with love over the making of the film -- her successful efforts to persuade mtv to withdraw funding , her objection to the use of several songs , her attempts to intimidate anyone involved in the production . no one can blame broomfield for being infuriated at love , particularly when her 11th-hour legal stunt forced kurt & courtney out of the sundance film festival lineup . it might have been easier to sympathize with him , however , if his presence in the film weren't so consistently intrusive . like michael moore , broomfield has no qualms about filming himself in the process of making his documentary film ; unlike moore , broomfield isn't entertaining enough to warrant all the screen time . in fact , he's just plain annoying at times , interjecting commentary over virtually every musical selection ( or lack thereof ) and casually referring to cobain's hometown of aberdeen , washington as a " redneck logging town . " even his habit of shooting from inside the car as it pulls up to various locations feels pretentious , an attempt at you-are-there urgency which conveniently ignores that automotive jaunts hardly make for compelling cinema . lucky for broomfield that his subject is such a wild and provocative one . watching the kind of people with whom kurt and courtney surrounded themselves makes you wonder why both of them didn't end up dead long before . it's far more damning in its contention that love's drive for fame and success tends to crush everything in its path , and that her history of verbal and physical assaults is just a hair's breadth removed from her obsessive need to control her public image . it would have been chilling to watch that personality connected more directly to cobain's psychological disintegration , but the troubled soul has little more than a cameo role in the film . kurt & courtney tends to drift away from its potentially fascinating subject ; it's a record of celebrity turned caustic , intercut with a record of a film-maker's pique . you almost wonder why he didn't call the film kurt & courtney & nick . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : warren beatty and jeremy pikser . director : warren beatty . naturally , the public responds to this unusual display of candor , and the teller of the truth becomes a sort of folk hero , much to the consternation of corporate america . that's the basic premise of a 1990 comedy called crazy people , in which dudley moore plays an advertising executive who snaps his cap and starts turning out product slogans like " volvo -- they're boxy , but they're good . " crazy people was less than completely successful because it didn't have a shred of story to offer once you got past the admittedly hilarious snippets of truth in advertising . bulworth is less than completely successful because it has _too much_ story , none of it in keeping with the frivolous , politically incorrect tone of its trailers . beatty crafts a solid opening as we see bulworth reduced to tears while watching a videotaped compendium of his television spots bashing affirmative action , preaching family falues and mouthing platitudes about " standing on the doorstep of a new millennium . " it's a dark and provocative tale , one which could easily turn off viewers who come in expecting something completely different . though he deftly inserts most of his social commentary into rap-style lyrics -- somehow a rapped lecture sounds less like a lecture -- it's still an aggressive attack on the powers that be as beatty sees them . add to this a tentative romance between bulworth and a young black woman ( halle berry ) , the intrusion of the hit-man sub-plot and even a bit of fish-out-of-water comedy as bulworth hides out in the 'hood , and you end up with a film that's more jittery than edgy . bulworth keeps lashing out in search of its tone -- one moment goofy and irreverent , the next moment grim and pedantic . there's nothing inherently wrong with a comedy delivering its goods unconventionally , provided the goods are delivered . there are plenty of comic high points in bulworth , including platt's superb performance as bulworth's ever-more-frantic right hand man and the shoot-from-the-hip speeches already showcased in previews . even if you agree with those politics , you may find bulworth leaving a strange and unpleasant aftertaste ; you'll know you've seen an interesting film , but you may feel cheated by the kind of film you got . i suspect viewers will wish they'd seen more of bulworth's comic rantings . perhaps this ad campaign could have used a dose of crazy people's truth in advertising . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : terry gilliam & tony grisoni and tod davies & alex cox . director : terry gilliam . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , brief gore , drug use , adult themes ) running time : 115 minutes . terry gilliam's fear and loathing in las vegas is about as faithful an adaptation of hunter s . thompson's 1971 " gonzo journalism " classic as i can imagine . . . though that's not necessarily a good thing . the book has long been called " unfilmable , " which probably referred more to whether it _should_ be made than whether it _could_ be made . it's wild , perverse , incoherent , sometimes very funny , and too visually literal an adaptation of a book best left to a twisted imagination . in terms of tone , at least , it's a nearly flawless companion piece to thompson's book . they were essentially journalistic , clinical analyses where even the most unpleasant situations were softened with a dollop of deadpan , left-field humor . gilliam similarly finds the demented gag in every situation , including a hallucinogenic orgy of lounge lizards ( rendered as actual reptiles by makeup whiz rob bottin ) , while still acknowledging the squalor . with depp doing a hilariously spot-on performance of thompson-as-duke and del toro sporting plenty of extra flab as the unhinged dr . gonzo , fear and loathing in las vegas feels exactly like it should feel : a cockeyed white-water rafting tour down a polluted stream of consciousness . it's also true that an episodic film like fear and loathing is only as successful as its individual episodes . there are also several scenes which turn absolute fidelity to the source material into grinding sluggishness . a head-trip film like this one is better suited for 90 minutes of damn-the-torpedoes pacing than for this kind of reverence . gilliam also manages to extract thompson's one and only " message " regarding the drug culture of the 60s and early 70s . the film's temporal setting -- " this foul year of our lord nineteen hundred and seventy-one " -- is defined as a turning point in the use and perception of drugs , with the innocent notion of chemicals as reality-expanding tools giving way to chemicals as reality-numbing tools . even here gilliam's fidelity to the source undermines him , as images of vietnam and nixon point a too-obvious accusatory finger , with thompson's own unapologetic voice subverted by suggestions that he's just a victim of the times . the audience for a film as down and dirty as this one is limited anyway , but the now-anachronistic incorrectness man not even appeal to the like-minded . it's also consistently intriguing , if for no other reason than gilliam's willingness to go every ugly place thompson's book went . the only thing really wrong with gilliam's fear and loathing is that it's a movie , bringing into vivid color that which should only have lived on the page . gonzo film-making doesn't end up with quite the same rebellious spark . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : deborah kaplan and harry elfont . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , sexual situations ) running time : 96 minutes . deborah kaplan and harry elfont have commented that one of the reasons they made can't hardly wait was that " nobody was making those good john hughes teen comedies any more . " that's probably why can't hardly wait feels so much like a greatest hits compilation , peppered with recognizable elements from the entire hughes oeuvre of the mid-80s and a dozen other teen comedies of the last 25 years for good measure . that's one hefty dose of deja-vu , enough to overwhelm most films this slight . fortunately , kaplan and elfont prove as adept at entertaining as they are at reminiscing . can't hardly wait may be familiar and predictable , but it's never out-and-out dumb , and at times it's surprisingly funny . the appealing cast features solid work from lauren ambrose as vulnerable wiseacre denise and seth green as a tries-too-hard homeboy with whom she ends up locked in a bathroom . some of the forced whimsy does fall flat ( notably jenna elfman's cameo as an " angel " offering advice to the lovelorn preston ) , and kaplan and elfont probably toss a few too many pop culture references on the fire . for once , however , the problems in a teen comedy spring from over-writing rather than under-writing . if there's one noteworthy hole in can't hardly wait , it's the central plot of preston's pursuit of amanda . ethan embry is pleasant enough in an unrequited puppy-dog way , but this is the kind of role john cusack defined a decade ago ; you root for preston not because his entire demeanor sells his longing , but because the machinations of the plot point you in that direction . of all the plot threads running through can't hardly wait , theirs is by far the least interesting , though it's the one inevitably destined to provide the happy ending . still , it's hard not to find charms in a teen comedy that's lively , moderately intelligent and effective in its portrayal of high school social dynamics . it also features a wonderfully eclectic soundtrack which runs the gamut from guns 'n' roses to smashmouth , from third eye blind to run-dmc , from parliament to the title tune by the replacements . can't hardly wait even manages to include a bit of social commentary in its adolescent craziness , promoting environmental awareness , safe sex and responsible drinking and driving behavior . sure , the latter is emphasized when party attendees drop their car keys into a bowl , which is yet another detail swiped from say anything . can't hardly wait shows off its antecedents unabashedly , and still comes up with something satisfying on its own level . looks like john hughes didn't have to worry about telling a generation of movie-goers " don't you forget about me .

screenplay : christopher scott cherot . director : christopher scott cherot . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity ) running time : 92 minutes . like other recent indy success stories including the brothers mcmullen and clerks , hav plenty will win admirers for its comic charms and low-budget , can-do enthusiasm , even as detractors line up to fire pot-shots at its gross amateurishness and complete lack of visual style . think of it as puppy cinema : it's so easy to be won over by their cute , slobbery energy that you may overlook how much they need discipline to avoid making a mess time and time again . christopher scott cherot , the multi-hyphenate creator of hav plenty , definitely has the puppy thing down cold . not everyone could get away with a premise that sounds like a film-maker's ego-stroking fantasy . cherot , however , is so unassuming and self-effacing -- and so doncha-just-love-him puppy-cute -- that all the unsolicited romantic advances actually seem like they make him uncomfortable . though far from a polished performer , cherot has a natural screen presence , an eye for wry commentary and the rare ability in the 90s to sell a pratfall . simply put , it's easy to like him , even when the film's narrative gets a little rough around the edges . make that a _lot_ rough around the edges . cherot has a solid enough sense for how to put together a comic scene , but he hasn't got a clue yet how to unite them . hav plenty amounts to little more than a series of vignettes , ideas for character encounters lined up in a row until they add up to 90 minutes . the characters are little more than one-dimensional , occasionally even grotesque caricatures for the deadpan cherot to react to . there are even takes included where the actors clearly fumble their lines . in such a makeshift effort , the sly , slick performance of hill harper stands out as a hilarious delight . playing hav's fiance michael , a criminally insincere r&b star whose song titles involve such romantic analogies as comparing a woman to malt liquor in " love forty , " harper creates one genuinely brilliant scene and one great comic character . that scene and cherot's low-key appeal are enough to push hav plenty over the edge as an entertaining diversion . mostly , however , cherot will earn plaudits for his good intentions -- for making the film nearly as a one-man show , for creating a romantic comedy with smart , upscale african-american characters , etc . hav plenty ends with lee finding success as the " true story " of his relationship with havilland becomes his first film . if cherot wants to find success beyond hav plenty , he'll need to mature as an effective story-teller rather than just an effective joke-teller . a messy puppy may be cute , but all grown up he's just a mess . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : jonathan hensleigh and j . j . abrams . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 150 minutes . you gotta give bonus points to the touchstone pictures publicity department for uncommon candor on the subject of big-budget film screenwriting . after creating an additional writing credit to accommodate two more names ( " adaptation " on top of " story " and " screenplay , " as if you could figure out the difference ) , jerry bruckheimer and touchstone appear to have publicly embraced the concept of pot-luck screenwriting : the notion that if a dozen different guys all bring something to the table , you end up with a cinematic meal . the subject , of course , is this summer's favorite -- a huge celestial body on a collision course with our big blue marble , this one an asteroid the size of texas . it's enough to generate flashbacks from deep impact , where the feeble attempts to generate sweeping emotion more often generated sleeping emotion . armageddon , to its credit , at least gets its priorities straight . make no mistake , this is a special effects-driven action film , chock-a-block with ahhh-inspiring scenes -- exploding space shuttles , meteor showers toppling the empire state building , the gargoyles on the notre dame cathedral watching as paris is reduced to baguette crumbs . director michael bay predictably resorts to tension-builders like close shaves with countdown clocks , but at least he knows enough to keep the focus on the drill team's mission once they're in space . for its final 75 minutes , armageddon is virtually nothing but explosions , crashes and narrow escapes . . . and that's a good thing . it's the _first_ 75 minutes which truly test your gag reflex , as the aforementioned cadre of writers tries vainly to create the illusion of character development . stock interpersonal conflicts share time with tender moments as all involved make their peace before heading off to save humanity ; i'm not sure whether i was more moved by the gruff reconciliation between grace and harry , or a . j . wooing grace using animal crackers for foreplay ( don't ask ) . it's all a load of nonsense , made even less interesting by bay's foolish decision to keep chopping back and forth between the playful introduction of our roughneck protagonists and a solemn war room session at nasa . there's nothing cohesive or compelling about armageddon as narrative ; strangely enough , it feels like the result of a dozen different writers contributing individual scenes or lines of dialogue . i'm not going to suggest that armageddon isn't a pretty effective diversion . if there's one thing a dozen writers can do , it's produce a bunch of solid laughs and craft a few exciting action sequences . there's just not much more you can expect from a film where they seem more interested in throwing in a godzilla gag than in letting one writer create an actual story . for all the uneven visceral enjoyment that it's worth , touchstone pictures proudly presents armageddon : a blockbuster a la carte . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : gavin scott , adam rifkin and ted elliott & terry rossio . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 104 minutes . some films are so bald-faced in their attempt to have it both ways that you just have to hand it to 'em for their chutzpah . on one level , for instance , it's obvious small soldiers wants to skewer gung-ho militarism . those same folks also know that the destruction to come will be considered bitchin' cool by a contingent in the audience which might be inclined to by small soldiers merchandise . in an era where action figure tie-ins are as much a part of popcorn movie-making as plastic fast food cups , small soldiers bypasses the inconvenient middle step of figuring out how to turn the characters into toys . it also bypasses the inconvenient middle step of explaining why we should side with the peace-loving gorgonites when the film makes the commando elite's assault ( complete with flaming tennis balls , nail guns and make-shift helicopters ) look like so much fun . it would be easier to dismiss small soldiers if the result weren't so entertaining , not to mention frequently amusing . for adults , it will be clever mostly in an in-jokey sort of way , from references to gremlins' gizmo to the use of he-man icons like ernest borgnine , george kennedy and clint walker as voices for the commando elite . the rest of the voice talent -- spinal tap alums christopher guest , michael mckean and harry shearer re-united as gorgonites ; sarah michelle gellar and christina ricci voicing mutant versions of a barbie-style doll -- isn't too shabby either . the humans may be a pretty boring lot ( excluding phil hartman , in his last film role as christy's consumer electronics-obsessed dad ) , but the combination of stan winston's animatronics and perfectly-integrated cgi versions make the toy story a fairly lively one . small soldiers is just weird and twisted enough to be worth a matinee . it's also a poorly-concealed version of the same action worship you find in a film like armageddon , though it's almost better when the worship is thoroughly unironic . the token attempts at satire notwithstanding , small soldiers plays most like a juiced-up feature-length commercial for _real_ commando elite action figures , available now at a store near you . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : david swift and nancy meyers & charles shyer , based on " das doppelte lottchen " by erich kastner . director : nancy meyers . mpaa rating : pg ( mild profanity ) running time : 125 minutes . there are probably equal reasons to fear for the worst and hope for the best in considering a remake of disney's 1961 film the parent trap . on the one hand , you have disney's recent track record plundering its own vaults for tiresome , frantic " updates " like 101 dalmatians , that darn cat and flubber . which would rule : 1990s disney scatalogy-mongering , or shyer/meyers restraint and family appeal ? it's a pleasure to report that the 1998 model of the parent trap offers far more of the latter than the former , though it's far from an unqualified success . what's most right about the parent trap is that it avoids what has been most wrong about other recent disney remakes . from the opening credits sequence , which depicts nick and elizabeth's whirlwind marriage to the tune of nat king cole's " l-o-v-e , " the parent trap seems to have a modicum of class and an interest in telling a story without explosions or flatulence . there are some high-spirited pranks as the girls compete at camp , and a bit of slapstick during a camping trip , but mostly it's just a pleasant , amusing diversion that could have been made 30 years ago like the original . a high-concept premise rarely feels this low-concept . the one thing it couldn't have had thirty years ago is 11-year-old lindsay lohan , the film's captivating star . child actors are trouble enough , and child actors in their first feature film even more so , but lohan's good-natured sweetness is infectious . she even adopts a quite serviceable english accent which should make more veteran actors ( are you listening , kevin costner ) hang their heads in shame . lohan is just part of a solid cast , including hendrix as a juicy villainess and lisa ann walter as nick's acerbic housekeeper , which gives the story plenty of humor and warmth . and it's a nice touch to see joanna barnes , reprising her character from the original parent trap in the appropriate role of meredith's mother . as is the case with most remakes , it's tough to argue that the parent trap was crying out for a contemporary re-telling . this version brings nothing revolutionary to the table , drags through some sluggish spots in its two hour running time , and never really builds much chemistry between quaid and richardson . most disappointing is the climactic camping trip where the twins torment the hapless city girl meredith ; the sequence is too short , the editing too choppy , and the resolution far too abrupt . the parent trap is basically the kind of film usually described with a dismissive word like " cute , " which is certainly accurate enough . " cute " films are becoming harder and harder to find , however , and this one keeps things light enough to sidestep any of shyer and meyers' more saccharine impulses . every once in a while , uncomplicated and inoffensive fun feels just right . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : david zucker , robert locash , lewis friedman and jeff wright . director : david zucker . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , slapstick violence ) running time : 105 minutes . if your comic tastes run to the urbane , this is most definitely the summer of your discontent . there's something about mary brought you mangled genitalia and dangling bodily fluids ; mafia ! anyone want to place bets on whether it's going to be an oscar wilde-ian romp spilling over with tres bon mots ? fact is , baseketball tosses off the kind of groin-level humor that makes there's something about mary look like a particularly droll " new yorker " cartoon . this tale of two losers ( parker and stone ) who create a sports sensation combining elements of baseball and basketball scurries about in search of every imaginable source of vulgar , offensive and/or just plain immature comedy . stone lactates like a parisian fountain ; parker slurps liposuctioned fat from a plastic bag ; both stars sport prosthetic male members which make it look like they're auditioning for the sequel to boogie nights . no subject is too sensitive for some sort of peurile gag : not gays , not foreign accents , not raving bigots , not necrophilia . damn them all for making it funny too often to dismiss . yes , baseketball certainly crosses the line at times from daring to mean-spirited . stone and parker take the opportunity to run with every possible distracting comment , gesture and visual image . there's nowhere too low for them to sink , and they get enough laughs to justify going just a bit lower the next time . it's hard to tell whether parker and stone have the stuff to be legitimate big screen comic stars . still , there's a sense that they're just the slightest bit desperate to impress , too eager to reach for a four-letter punch line before coming up with a more clever alternative . it just feels lazy , one overgrown adolescent playing to other overgrown adolescents , congratulating himself for being the id boy of the moment . strange as it may seem , david zucker ends up being the steadying influence which reins in parker and stone . zucker knows how to play a near-subliminal visual joke with the best of them , and he works in plenty of knee-slappers in baseketball . even when he steals from himself in the character of a sick boy at the mercy of idiots ( a la jill whelan in airplane ! ) , he gives it a fresh twist ; there's nothing quite like watching an 8-year-old in need of a liver transplant doing rounds of tequila shots . that's one of the tamer bits in baseketball , a film that sometimes doesn't know when to quit . there will be viewers who revel in that sort of " look at me , ma , i'm being irreverent " irreverence . others will shake their heads at the continuation of their comedic summer of discontent , even through their own embarrassed giggles . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
director : steve miner . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 85 minutes . the film was john carpenter's halloween , a low-budget phenomenon which launched the much-loathed but immensely profitable " teen slasher " genre . masked and/or mutilated maniacs proliferated , the numbers on the sequels clicking by faster than the number of customers served by mcdonald's . it's no wonder dimension films tagged the sub-title twenty years later on halloween h20 ; they probably feared viewers would actually think this was the 20th film in the series . this sequel , of course , is banking on something a bit more than name recognition to draw viewers : nostalgia . if you've ever wondered what surviving the carnage of a teen slasher movie would do to someone , here's your answer . that effective bit of back story carries halloween h20 over the pitfalls of genre convention which even executive producer kevin williamson -- the post-modernist horror connoisseur behind scream and scream 2 -- can't quite shake off . the one thing williamson and director steve miner _do_ bring to the proceedings is a bit more understated menace . surprisingly , every encounter between michael and an unfortunate stranger does not result in an impromptu ginzu aeration . this killer's singularity of purpose , combined with some well-crafted set-pieces , allows this halloween to score more points with tension than it does with shock value . clearly it also scores on the basis of its climactic showdown . laurie's resourcefulness in the original halloween made her an uncommon screen heroine , and the same quality is present this time around . it's actually here that williamson's sensibility shows through most obviously ; playing on genre expectations , halloween h20 shows laurie not trusting anything as mundane as a body bag to guarantee that michael won't be back to continue tormenting her in halloween h21 . the return of laurie strode could have been a cheap publicity stunt . instead , it's a genuinely effective recognition of the original's influence . though too conventional to be truly thrilling , halloween h20 is a fitting final round for one of screen history's bloodiest family feuds . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
i know what you're probably thinking about dance with me , because it's the same thing i was thinking . this would be nothing more than a bunch of dance sequences strung together by something that could only be called a plot if you were being particularly generous . even the film's trailer , which featured about a dozen words in two minutes , contributed to the impression that dance with me wouldn't be about characters , but about plastic wind-up dance toys masquerading as characters . yes , the film's original title -- shut up and dance -- would certainly prove prescient . i'll tell you what i wasn't expecting : one of the year's most appealing , charismatic performances . ruby is an enigma to rafael , since her fierce dedication to dancing doesn't seem to be connected to any real joy . simple stuff , to be sure -- perhaps even simplistic -- but dance with me sells its simplicity almost entirely on the strength of chayanne's appeal . though it's certainly helpful that he's has boyish good looks and an inviting smile , his success can't be dismissed as purely hormonal . he has to anchor both of the film's big emotional hooks -- tentative attempts to connect with the father he has never known , and the romance with williams -- in spite of a language barrier , which he does by acting with his face and body language as well as any young performer of the last several years . chayanne has that intangible something called presence , something that gets you more involved in a simple story than the material probably deserves . that presence is most forceful when he hits the dance floor in an exhilarating sequence at a latin dance club . the sequence hinges on rafael conveying to ruby the pure joy of dance , and that joy explodes from his every movement . as obviously choreographed as some of the " spontaneous " moves in the club might be , it's still infectious to watch when rafael seems to be having so much fun . anyone who can invoke singin' in the rain without inspiring gasps at the sacrilege has to be doing something right . first-time screenwriter daryl matthews ( also the film's choreographer ) makes the mistake of making ruby's conflict central at a time in the narrative when there's already plenty of conflict to go around . director randa haines , meanwhile , makes the mistake of spending too much time showing us the competition itself . if the point was to prove how much more exciting club dancing is than regimented competitive dancing , that point is made and made again for nearly half an hour , including ridiculous comic relief from joan plowright as a spunky geriatric . the solid chemistry between williams and chayanne is lost , the father-son relationship is buried and the dancing rapidly grows tiresome . predictable though the story may have been , at least is was energetic . dance with me decides to turn into a dance movie exactly when the dancing is least interesting , and after the hero has made his impression . his charisma makes much of the film watchable , until it reaches the point where , much to your disappointment , they make him and everyone else just shut up and dance . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : tamara jenkins . director : tamara jenkins . mpaa rating : r ( adult themes , nudity , sexual situations , profanity ) running time : 91 minutes . sometimes i just want to shake a film-maker who doesn't seem to understand the strengths of her own story . the mid-70s setting at first seems fairly arbitrary , a token attempt at period color , but eventually the two main characters deepen the resonance of the time . that relationship forms the foundation for a solid story where the laughs could have come from simple character interaction . there's nothing faintly interesting or real about rita or her problems ; they're like the shenanigans of a wacky relative on a television sit-com . every scene with tomei is an over-the-top distraction , turning a low-key character study into forced farce . it's not as though jenkins needed to pad the running time because there wasn't anything more substantial with which to fill it . there's enough going on in that slightly radioactive nuclear famliy to fill a feature film without bringing in crazy cousin rita . slums of beverly hills draws you in with some sensitive observations about a family trying to cope with a profound generation gap , as well as with a breakout performance by the unconventionally fetching lyonne . then , it starts pushing you away with gratuitous eccentricity . i wish jenkins had showed more faith in murray and vivian . like the abramowitzes themselves , she doesn't seem to know how good she really has it . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
[note : some of the content in this review may be considered spoilers] the risk , of course , is that knowing the outcome way ahead of time might somehow reduce its emotional impact . how effective can a tear-jerker be if you're waiting for them to be jerked ? one true thing deftly sidesteps that problem -- at least for half its running time -- by being nothing at all like a conventional tear-jerker . at its core , it tells a story of one of adulthood's most daunting tasks : coming to terms with the humanity of one's parents . as long as the focus remains on those three characters and their relationships , one true thing is solid film-making . meryl streep delivers yet another winning performance , finding the warmth and compassion in kate without ever turning her into a cartoon . the small mannerisms in her attempts to connect with ellen -- an almost imperceptible rejected touch , hidden disappointment at her daughter's dismissals of her -- are the stuff great screen acting is made of . the guldens are a thoroughly recognizable modern family , their interactions real enough to evoke emotion and sympathy without resorting to sobs or recriminations . there's something particularly wrenching about watching people who love each other trying to like each other . alas , the plot device which brought ellen back home soon rears its head and pulls one true thing in the wrong direction . it's not that the cancer storyline is mawkish or overly manipulative . indeed , franklin's direction and streep's performance avoid most of the traps which can turn such stories into melodrama . once the big c starts taking over the proceedings , the nuances of character which had made one true thing such compelling viewing begin to lose their force . conversations become confrontations ; the words sound progressively more scripted and less genuine . a tighter , leaner screenplay might have been able to keep ellen's journey of discover squarely at the center of one true thing . there's only one true thing which makes one true thing glow with realism , and that's the struggle of parents and their adult children to deal with each other as adults , as equals , as fellow human beings . that's the reason it was so wise to remove the live-or-die suspense from a story that's not about who will live or die . that's also the reason it was so disappointing to watch the film linger on a foregone conclusion . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 109 minutes . what dreams may come , a sort of post-mortem romantic fantasy-drama , shows us a world which is unlike any we've seen before on screen . oh sure , plenty of films have ventured into the realms of the afterlife , from the sublime ( defending your life ) to the ridiculous ( jacob's ladder ) . this , however , is a heaven of a different , considerably gaudier color . those scenes in chris's heaven-of-his-own-making highlight what dreams may come at its finest , creating spectacularly imaginative visions of the next world . unfortunately , those same scenes also highlight the film's most glaring weakness . it's an inevitable part of metaphysical fantasies like this that someone has to bring the audience up to speed on exactly what they're seeing and why . that doesn't make it any less tedious , especially when what dreams may come isn't supposed to be about what makes particular cosmic gears turn the way they do . the scenes of chris's earthly life with his family , strewn throughout the film in a near-subliminal series of flashbacks , form a potent back-story of a life which isn't as suburban-ideal as it first appears . there's something compelling about the suggetion that love doesn't have to be perfect to be powerful . those emotions should have carried what dreams may come to a transcendent level , if not for those nagging distractions . it's not just the constant exposition which causes the problems , either . an even bigger distraction is robin williams , whose performance can't quite capture the aching love he's supposed to be feeling . williams is certainly a fine performer , but there are times when he's giving a " serious " performance that he looks like he's trying way too hard . the furrows in his brow , the perpetually fidgeting lip and the over-dramatized line readings turn too many interpersonal moments into exercises in how not to act on the big screen . annabella sciorra's convincing anguish could have grounded the story in heart-breaking reality if williams hadn't kept pulling it into melodrama . again , the marvelous look of the film draws you in , as annie's shattered mindscape takes the form of the nielsens' home turned a desolate grey . and again , a viewer is pulled away from the look of the film by tortuous exposition and emotional confrontations which only feel genuine on one side . what dreams may come will likely wring tears from those entranced by the ghost-like prospect of romance beyond the pale . for others , it will seem like a missed opportunity . if a tale of primal fears and primal emotions can't grab you without a nattering narrator , something's very wrong . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
director : bryan singer . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 110 minutes . creepy , disquieting stuff , to be sure , but there's one crucial puzzle piece missing from director bryan singer's ( the usual suspects ) adaptation of the stephen king novella : why ? why does todd become so improbably fascinated with the horrors of genocide and the wielding of absolute power over the life of another ? why do denker's tales turn him alternately into a nightmare-plagued wreck and a glassy-eyed borderline psycho ? there's certainly a story to be told by making the teen demon of apt pupil a golden boy rather than a troubled misfit -- perhaps to suggest the capacity for evil within us all , perhaps as a commentary on how we make the forbidden fascinating by hiding it from the eyes of children . what's missing is a motivation for this particular boy , something that makes him more than a symbolic representation of good youth gone awry . that absence of motivation becomes even more glaring in the film's second half , when the power dynamic between the two characters shifts back in denker's favor . mckellen's sharp performance shows denker's icy confidence growing by the scene , until it's clear that the hunted has become the hunter once more . it's easy to understand denker's character and follow his twists , turns and changes . by contrast , todd's dark side seems to emerge strictly for bad seed shock value . even the gaps in todd's characterization become less important as singer's taut direction takes over in the climactic thirty minutes . apt pupil is a rare example of a thriller that gets better as it approaches its conclusion , rather than collapsing in a muddle of rushed plot points and pat resolutions . it's hard not to imagine how effective a film it might have been if todd bowden made more sense as a character . that missing something is what makes apt pupil merely morbidly intriguing , rather than truly disturbing . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
director : john carpenter . mpaa rating : r ( violence , gore , profanity , adult themes , nudity ) running time : 107 minutes . it's refreshing to see a film about vampires that's actually about vampires . not vampirism as a metaphor for aids , not vampirism as a metaphor for drug addiction , not vampirism as a metaphor for persecuted minority groups , or as a metaphor for anything else -- just blood-suckin' , sun-hatin' , butt-kickin' vampires . john carpenter's vampires is the kind of slick horror package that's increasingly hard to find : raucous , sanguine and almost utterly devoid of sociological sub-text . add plenty of flying body parts , stark western vistas and carpenter's own twangy tex-mex score , and you have a simple , economical horror yarn . it all makes for fine gruesome entertainment , but it should have been better . john carpenter has always been able to incorporate wry , weird humor into his films -- remember the crawling head in the thing , or practically all of big trouble in little china , for that matter ? -- and he manages again to pull of a few nice bits of black comedy . woods , playing crow with snarling relish and a serious bad attitude , gets most of the choice lines , all of which are either unprintable or incredibly offensive or both . carpenter's sense of the horrific usually involves a kind of self-aware outrageousness , turning his displays of blood-spraying special effects into absurdist cinematic goofs too purely escapist to get worked up over . unfortunately , vampires keeps upsetting its delicate balance of humor and horror by taking frequent detours into mean-spiritedness . it's one thing to play with notions of political incorrectness ; it's quite another to get off on it . even if you grant carpenter and screenwriter don jakoby the slack they seem to be searching for -- it's okay that a woman is stripped and smacked around because she's a vampire-in-waiting , and it's okay that a catholic priest participates in a human sacrifice because another priest is a stand-up guy -- the tone simply gets nastier than it needs to be . everyone is too unpleasant too often . the thing about vampires is that when carpenter rolls up his sleeves and dives into genre action , it's a lot of fun . in fact , if he had rolled with the tone of the first 25 minutes , he might have had a minor classic on his hands . there's not enough interest in characterization here to make the casual brutality of crow and montoya somehow psychologically appropriate . psychology's got virtually nothing to do with john carpenter's vampires , a slice of halloween mayhem that works wonderfully when it lets the good times roll . for a vampire movie without a " message , " it offers some mixed messages it could do without . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
so much for adam sandler , " normal " guy . while still fairly silly in its own way , the wedding singer was a somewhat more mature , somewhat more clever vehicle for sandler , and his first attempt at actual screen acting . in the waterboy , sandler is once again in infantile , silly-voiced rare form , the kind of character that strikes unholy terror in a critic's heart . it would be a gross exaggeration to call the waterboy a smart film , but it's funny in ways i didn't quite expect . the opening minutes of the waterboy don't hold out much hope for anything beyond 12-year-old comic sensibilities . sight gags predominate , from a football hitting bobby in the head , to pratfalls over a water cooler , to sandler motoring about on a riding lawn mower . a few giggles leak out of the predictabe sophomorism , while sandler's stuttering , soft-spoken variation on cajun man threatens to wear out his welcome very early on . sandler starts getting more endearingly innocent rather than acting like an oblivious moron . and the sight gags start getting funnier , perhaps as much related to a build-up of good will as to any change in approach . the incongruous presence of bates and winker ( the latter sporting decidedly un-fonzie-esque love handles ) certainly helps , but there's something about the writing in the waterboy that kept sneaking up on me , delivering a left-field laugh at times when i was expecting an obvious bit of slapstick idiocy . many people probably associate sandler with moron comedy in the ernest/pauly shore/carrot top vein , perhaps without having seen any of his films . he and frequent writing partner tim herlihy are considerably more sly than that . they've learned a few lessons in grown-up comedy from the wedding singer , and bring that sensibility to the lower common denominator audience targeted with the waterboy . they certainly miss the target plenty of times -- rob schneider's extended cameo gets more insufferable every time he appears -- but they also don't fire at the same stupid target over and over again . between the lethargic opening and the who-cares romance between sandler and bad girl fairuza balk , the waterboy offers goofy entertainment . it appears sandler doesn't have to be " normal " to be funny . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : richard lagravenese . director : richard lagravenese . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , drug use , brief nudity ) running time : 93 minutes . no , it's not the plot for an episode of " ally mcbeal , " though it sure seems like it at times . writer and first-time director richard lagravenese sets up living out loud as a wistful comedy about adults reaching a point in their lives where they wonder if it's too late to make up for their bad decisions . at least initially , it appears that living out loud is going to balance the stories of its two main characters , and that's when the film is at its best . devito's performance may be his best screen work to date , finding the romanticism at the heart of pat's irresponsibility . playing a decent guy is one of an actor's toughest challenges , but devito makes pat a genuinely decent guy who's also an interesting guy . with queen latifah added to the mix as a singer with unique relationship issues , there's an earthy counter-point for hunter's nervous energy . the importance of that counter-point is only truly evident when it's gone . at 93 minutes , living out loud feels strangely incomplete , perhaps because pat vanishes into the background in the final half of the film and judith takes over completely . unfortunately , a little of judith goes a long way . while it's easy to sympathize with her situation , it's much harder to sympathize with her , because -- to put it bluntly -- she grows annoying to spend time with . holly hunter is a very talented actress , but here she acts with mannerisms instead of finding the character's emotional center . she plays judith like an alien investigating the world -- an interesting choice for a character in existential crisis , but one that underlines things rather than letting them unfold . in nearly every scene , you can see hunter's acting muscles bulging and flexing . living out loud still manages to be somewhat satisfying , largely thanks to devito and lagravenese . for a writer making his first venture into directing , lagravenese shows a solid cinematic sensibility , though he does also let the camera linger on people delivering dialogue . it's wonderful to find a writer actually writing for grown-ups , and some of his tart lines and absurdist fantasy situations are fun in bits and pieces , but ultimately living out loud is a frustrating experience . all that's missing is a computer-generated baby dancing to " hooked on a feeling .

screenplay : david marconi . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 127 minutes . director tony scott presents what sometimes seems like a documentary on electronic surveillance in enemy of the state . it's a great button-pushing premise for a millenial-angst-heavy information age , full of shadowy government operations and technological voyeurism of every shape and form . the first time a chase scene spills over with surveillance details , it's effective and alarming . the second time , you start to notice that it drags scenes out much longer than they need to be . the third , fourth and fifth times , you wonder why the omniscient gadgetry is beginning to seem more cool than scary . is this a movie about people oppressed by electronics , or a commercial for electronics ? fortunately , the human angle is in the capable hands of will smith . in his first purely starring role -- no buddy cop , no aliens -- smith continues to show the charisma of a star . he's a more effective hounded everyman than you might expect , cracking wise when it serves the moment while generally handling his predicament with intelligence and resolve . hackman arrives fairly late in the film to provide some requisite bonding moments , but mostly the weight of enemy of the state falls squarely on smith's shoulders . he proves more than capable of handling it . he also gets to work with an action/thriller script considerably more coherent than average . the resolution is a rushed disappointment -- mixing in a dopey mob sub-plot just when the table-turning pleasures of dean and brill watching the watchmen had been so promising -- but for nearly two hours it's pretty a effective story . with scott keeping the pacing steady and intense , all the script needs to do is avoid situations so obviously stupid that you feel insulted . marconi's script may not be impressive , but it's unobtrusive , which is one of the higher compliments you can pay an action/thriller script in 1998 . still , there's the matter of all those gee-whiz shots of satellite cams , computer extrapolations and general manipulation of technology . sure it's unsettling to consider that the only privacy you may have is inside your head , but it's most unsettling if we connect with a character connecting with that reality the hard way . will smith provides that humanity almost in spite of scott's inventory of spy gear . the director takes the edge off the edgy concept , turning in a solid thriller that hypes us up when it should be freaking us out . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
it's really rather a slick conceit when you stop to think about it -- telling the tale of the early years of the reign of queen elizabeth i ( cate blanchett ) with the virgin queen turned into michael corleone . it's all played as grand opera , with the initially uncertain monarch surrounded by advisors of every possible motivation . screenwriter michael hirst and director shekhar kapur manage to keep all these balls in the air quite deftly , moving back and forth between the machinations of various factions while keeping all the players clearly defined . ultimately , however , elizabeth is more a well-crafted plot structure than a great tragic drama . as solid as most of the cast members are , they aren't asked to do much more than furrow their brows and skulk . at least it's all quite a spectacle to behold . the radiant blanchett makes a wonderful elizabeth , though her chemistry with joseph fiennes isn't nearly as invigorating as it was with brother ralph in oscar and lucinda . it's a consistently engaging film , but one which never crosses over into being truly captivating . while aiming for the epic sweep of a godfather film , the film-makers seem to have forgotten that coppola created an epic of relationships , not just political alliances . elizabeth is that rare film that would have been much better if it had been much longer . if it had offered the chance to feel the personalities of history as well as watch them , it would have been an offer you couldn't refuse . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
jane horrocks delivers a show-stopping stage performance in little voice , the kind worthy of the divas she honors . the most astonishing element of horrocks' performance is that she gets no assistance from the original vocalists . the actress truly can do frighteningly dead-on recreations of garland , dietrich , holliday , monroe and half a dozen others , and its a wonder to behold . the showcase for both horrocks and her character is a performance at a run-down cabaret , set up by mari's current flame , small-time talent scout ray say ( michael caine ) . in a live theater setting , you can imagine horrocks' musical numbers being positively electrifying . even on-screen her transformation from minnie mouse to mighty mouth is grand theater at its finest , and the renditions of standards like " get happy " and " i wanna be loved by you " are extremely appealing . it doesn't take long , however , to realize that little voice is built entirely around horrocks' admittedly impressive party trick . as flawed as ray and mari are , they deserve better than to vanish after receiving a comeuppance . it's frustrating watching them reduced to impediments to l . v . 's ability finally to spread her wings ( and it's not as though the bird metaphor isn't beaten to an ugly death ) . it's all the more disappointing because , for most of its running time , little voice doesn't seem headed that way at all . its eccentric characters , while stagey , all have their goofy appeal , particularly jim broadbent as the nightclub's cheesy owner/emcee . director mark herman develops his small-town atmosphere nicely , and his adapted screenplay keeps the humor fairly consistent . it's actually nearly half an hour into the film before l . v . breaks into song for the first time , allowing ample time to build the significance of the characters and their relationships . then comes l . v . 's big debut , and it starts to seem that everyone else was just part of the warm-up act . l . v . emerges from her shell , she sings and she changes , and about as abruptly as you can imagine , the credits begin to roll . little voice is largely diverting in its way , and horrocks is truly wonderful , but eventually it's somewhat disappointing . i didn't expect to leave the theater feeling that an ensemble story had been turned into a one-woman show of judymania . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
i'll admit that i didn't rent the original psycho last night so i could make my shot-by-shot comparison with a fresh memory . i'm fairly certain hitchcock didn't make it explicit that master bates was masturbating while watching marion crane disrobe , the opening helicopter shot was definitely new , and i can't recall near-subliminal shots of gathering storm clouds edited into the legendary " shower scene . " otherwise , everything appeared pretty consistent with my recollection . director gus van sant -- for reasons he has given anywhere from " why not remake a good film instead of a bad film ? " to just plain " why not ? " -- had indeed taken one of american cinema's most iconic horror films , dipped it in color , and served it up whole to a new generation of movie-goers . the metronomic repetition of " why " is a bit futile at this point , but i'm willing to hazard my own guess as to the answer : van sant wanted to remind viewers what a brilliant director alfred hitchcock was , and what a brilliant example of direction psycho was in particular . i hope viewers ( and critics ) don't fold their arms in indignation so tightly against their chests that they fail to recognize how incredibly suspenseful and tautly paced the first hour of this psycho is . heretical though it may seem to say so , the first half of this psycho is better than the original , because heche's interpretation of marion is better than janet leigh's . the staging -- hitch's ominous angles , bernard herrmann's chilling score -- masterfully builds the tension , but it also allows us watch heche's mind work , and she's as fiercely intelligent an actress as we have today . while the narrative is focused on marion's flight , it really flies . there's nothing exactly wrong with vaughn's performance , which is edgy and scary . towering over every other actor in the piece , his good looks untamed by a bad haircut , vaughn is far too physically intimidating to play the meek , sexually repressed basket case . he throws the entire second half of the film out of whack , leaving the audience with nothing to do but watch van sant and his cast play out the rest of the film . there are any number of reasons why a psycho nearly 40 years removed from the well-known original can't work quite as well . the shower scene is now a film-school standby as minutely dissected as the zapruder film , not a viscerally shocking surprise ; familiarity with the true nature of norman's " mother " makes some of his dialogue unintentionally humorous . but there's no question that it does still work as an example of building terror through film-making skill . it also shows that the success of particular choices may be built around the casting . the best choice with anthony perkins as norman does not equal the best choice with vince vaughn as norman -- it's chaos theory at its finest applied to the art of directing . this incarnation of psycho isn't a forgery of a great work of art . it's more like a photo of a great work in an art history textbook -- a bit flat , but intriguing enough to make you want to get a better look at the real thing . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : michael piller . director : jonathan frakes . mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , violence ) running time : 101 minutes . by now , every " star trek " fan deserving of the name is familiar with the " odd-even " rule for the feature films . the second , fourth , sixth and eighth films in the series have been the most entertaining ; the first , third , fifth and seventh , not so much . star trek : insurrection , the latest biannual return of the " next generation " cast , marks the ninth big-screen journey into the trek universe , inspiring a combination of trepidation and hope . could this finally be the adventure which would break the odd-number jinx ? well , not exactly . star trek : insurrection is an average story , competently told , energized primarily by the chance to mingle once again with the characters from the " next generation " television series . it seems that radiation on the ba'ku planet possesses a " fountain of youth " quality which makes it incredibly valuable , particularly to the genetically deteriorating son'a . star trek : insurrection , like most of the films in the series , is clearly designed to appeal to the trek faithful first , and to a broader audience second . that's one of the qualities which makes insurrection feel as fragmented as it does . over the course of a 100 minute film , trying to give seven characters enough to do to keep them happy leads to plenty of punch lines but not enough focus . stewart has the presence to make virtually anything he does feel commanding , but there's always a sense that he should have _more_ to do . just as he was always the best thing about the " next generation " series , he's the bext thing about the " next generation " films , whether playing the fool in a ceremonial headdress or radiating moral courage . stewart as picard is almost always going to be a good enough reason to watch a trek film , while watching him step back for the good of the ensemble will always be a bit disappointing . there are other good reasons to see this particular film , including some sharply-staged action sequences ( frakes showed a similar facility in 1996's first contact ) and plenty of belly laughs . there are also other reasons to be disappointed , including a wasted villain in f . murray abraham and a resolution which you may miss if you blink . altogether it feels a bit small for the big screen , more like a solid episode of the series ( complete with obvious allegory ) than a film . perhaps there aren't that many great ideas for trek features to go around , and maybe that's why the heirs to gene roddenberry's vision manage to come up with a really good one only once every four years . if they decided not to make a movie every two years , and waited until that really good idea was ready , they could eliminate that " odd-even " problem once and for all . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
down in the delta , a paean to the importance of family ties , stays such a course of earnestness and muted conflict that it's hard to work up much emotion about the people involved . the first act of down in the delta gets it off to a rocky start , presenting the inner city background with all the urgency of a generic studio back-lot . it's important to the film's themes that the city feel chaotic , a fragmented collection of people from fragmented homes , but it feels false right down to the crack-house apartment where loretta goes to get high ; even the always-reliable woodard appears adrift in some mediocre tv-drama episode . director maya angelou almost seems afraid of getting her hands dirty , as though the story's more uplifting message will be sullied by showing inner city life at its worst . down in the delta gets much stronger when the setting shifts south , and not just because the location feels more genuine . al freeman jr . radiates patriarchal gravity and moral strength as uncle earl , his keen eyes providing an added intelligence to every word of wisdom from his lips . screenwriter myron goble occasionally pushes too hard on these themes , stumbling over the vague estrangement of earl's son will ( wesley snipes ) , but freeman is always there to bring them back into focus . you never doubt for a moment that earl is the kind of man who can straighten out the lives of others not by lecturing to them , but by showing them the right way . down in the delta is the kind of film you'll probably walk out of with a good feeling , even though you may not necessarily have enjoyed it all that much . the key dramatic points prove to be exceedingly tame stuff , adding to the impression that the film is just cruising along on the momentum of its good intentions . usually films of this kind struggle by becoming too strident ; this one struggles by being not nearly strident enough . freeman alone makes this film worth watching , guiding both viewers and other characters to an understanding of what can be accomplished through a sense of shared responsibility . still , it should have been easier to be more supportive of a film with as many valuable things to say . down in the delta's soft-spoken drama is more likely to move you to respectful nods than to social action . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
director : bill condon . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , nudity , adult themes , sexual situations ) running time : 105 minutes . ian mckellen -- who has already won two year-end critics' awards as of this writing -- has a sinfully great time in gods and monsters . growling innuendo and wrapping his lips around a cigar that's not just a cigar , mckellen fashions whale early on as a dirty old man with little left to embrace but his own lasciviousness . there's no question that mckellen's work is a great time . . . great acting , not necessarily . in every other way the characters are completely dissimilar -- hurt played a timid professor who had lived his entire life as a straight husband , while mckellen takes on a flamboyant artist utterly at ease with his lifestyle . hurt's was the more difficult role , one in which a small man confronted upheaval and potential humiliation ; mckellen got a part full of punch lines and haunted recollections , the stuff actors turn into audition monologues . james whale isn't a role that requires a great performance . it's a role that requires an _entertaining_ performance . and entertaining it is , particularly in service of whale's intriguing biography . writer/director bill condon makes it evident that whale's affinity for creating screen monsters was born of sympathy , one outcast giving voice and soul to other outcasts . he even makes the sly suggestion that whale was also the father of camp , creating intentionally humorous films from horror stories as a sop to his own amused sensibilities . mckellen makes whale far too inventive to be pathetic , yet also shows him fighting with the shadow of his former self . but there's another character gobbling up chunks of screen time , and that's brendan fraser as the wrong-side-of-the-tracks gardener . it's a solid enough performance by fraser , but there's something trite about the entire structure of clay's friendship with whale , nearly as trite as lynn redgrave's fussy german housekeeper . it reaches the point where the story actually appears to be about clay , which is a big mistake . mckellen's performance may not be perfect , but it's still the best thing about gods and monsters . it's not incredibly touching , and it's not incredibly profound . it is , however , quite a lot of fun for a while . there are worse places to cast your lot than with the year's second best performance as an older gay man trying to woo a young heterosexual . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
it's difficult to explain how 85 minutes of effortless charm could be neutralized by one scene without giving away the ending of waking ned devine . as a film critic i almost always champion films that take narrative risks , avoiding the plague of the obvious . waking ned devine takes just such a risk , but the result feels like a particularly nasty bait-and-switch . where many films err with gratuitous sentimentality , this one errs with a gratuitous lack of sentimentality . the most frustrating thing is that so much of it is so entertaining . the sequence in which jackie and michael try to set up the deception , caught off-guard by mr . kelly's early arrival , shows director kirk jones to have a rare sort of comic timing . farce rarely works on film the way it works on a stage , but waking ned devine fires on every cylinder -- game actors in a great comic situation guided by a talented director . initially , the whole business seems to be little more than a distraction , an excuse for gags about odor and fruity soaps . and it is here , friends , that waking ned devine takes its left turn into black comedy and bleak morality . plenty of viewers will walk away from waking ned devine believing they have seen a feel-good film with a happy ending , but it is an entirely contrary reaction which blunted my enthusiasm . i laughed and laughed and laughed through much of the film . then i gasped . then i fumed . waking ned devine sheds its sympathy and its sense of good humor for what , in retrospect , feels like a cheap shock and a toast to situational ethics . 85 minutes of effortless charm counts for a lot . if only one scene didn't make it count for so much less . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
producers : robert michael geisler & john roberdeau and grant hill . director : terrence malick . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , brief nudity , adult themes ) running time : 168 minutes . the announcement that the thin red line would mark terrence malick's return to the director's chair after a twenty year absence was greeted as the cinematic equivalent of j . d . salinger popping open his smith-corona to give it another go . this was , after all , the hermit-genius of great american movie-making , whose only two previous films -- badlands and days of heaven -- were spoken of in tones of reverence . yet try as i might , i couldn't work up the same enthusiasm . as adept as malick was at crafting stunning visuals , narrative seemed to be an afterthought to him , something to be cobbled together with voice-over narration . good films , yes , and profoundly beautiful ones , but not profound ones . malick reaches for profundity once again in the thin red line ; the result is another good , great-looking tone poem where deep thoughts stand in the way of genuine drama . it's instantly clear that malick intends to take the thin red line in a very different direction from jones' novel . jones , while he frequently found his way into the heads of his characters , was equally concerned with providing a vivid sense of the physical -- the oppressive heat and humidity , the boots full of water , and the insect attacks that challenged the men on guadalcanal before a single shot was fired . for long stretches of the thin red line , malick seems to forget that these characters have bodies at all . the incessant koan-like philosophizing becomes aggravating enough , but it's even more frustrating that every one of the men , from the law school-educated staros to kentucky-bred farm boy witt , thinks in the same college-sophomore-on-a- double-bong-hit , my-fingernail-could-be-a-whole-nother-universe terms . with only a couple of notable exceptions -- bell's obsessive love for his wife , and tall's careerist self-loathing -- malick's internal monologues turn the characters into an indistinct jumble of existential angst . ironically , the thin red line is at its best when it does get down and dirty , following the company's assault on a well-defended japanese hill position . it's a superb piece of kinetic war film-making , the camera bursting through tall grass as soldiers are cut down during a suicidal head-on attack . there's more poetry and insight as the men discover what battle will make of them than there is in an hour's worth of navel-gazing and heavy-handed juxtapositions of war ( " bad " ) and nature ( " good " ) . there's little question that the thin red line is an aesthetic wonder , shot by john toll in fickle available light and edited into a wartime koyaanisqatsi . and it all might have worked much better if malick had let viewers draw their own messages from the images , rather than letting a soldier inform us that " war don't ennoble men . . . it even that tactic might have worked better if the voices had been distinctive , or if there were some exploration of esprit de corps which connected these men to one another . each character in the thin red line is living too squarely inside his own head to connect much with anyone else . that sentiment applies to terrence malick as well , who returns from his two decade sabbatical for three hours of stunningly photographed , overwrought introspection . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
if it's december or january , it must be time for " triumph over illness/handicap " films . into this crowded field comes the theory of flight , a quirky comedy-drama of romantic friendship starring kenneth branagh as richard hawkins , an artist so flighty that he actually does try to take flight . . . right off the roof of a building . cue soaring music and inspirational message . well , not exactly . thus unfolds a singularly odd sort of film , at once a dark comedy , an unconventional love story and , yes , a triumph over illness/handicap film . the strange thing about the theory of flight is that it's not always clear whose triumph over a handicap will be the focus of the film . as the narrative progresses , it becomes ever more clear that richard is the real protagonist of the piece , the character who is supposed to learn and change through this experience . unfortunately , he's also the character who is least interesting , and makes the least sense . there's something emotionally amiss with this fellow , that's for certain ; exactly what that something is , not so much . kenneth branagh ( apparently still suffering side effects from channeling woody allen in celebrity ) is all neurotic discomfort and goofy twitches . the character's intense desire to follow through on the bank robbery falls somewhere between melodramatic affectation and sincere-though-misguided expression of resolve , when only one or the other would truly clarify things . jane is a superb piece of characterization , never merely the self-pitying , hard-on-the-outside-soft-on-the-inside person with a handicap that has become such a cinematic cliche . though it's a challenging bit of physical acting for bonham carter to wrap her mouth around jane's slurred speech and adopt the distinctive movements , her finest moment is a silent one -- a pleading glance at richard as her voice synthesizer plays her recorded request . it's the clash between our interest in those two characters which prevents the theory of flight from soaring to the highest possible level . while richard's awakening to his own self-indulgence may be the point , it's still tedious watching him indulge himself when watching jane is so much more interesting . perhaps the problem is that there is too much high-concept to this tale , too many silly little bits of business to distract from genuine interaction between the two principal characters . it's hard for a love story to be great when you want one of the lovers to end up happy , and the other just to end up an adult . you have to commend the theory of flight for taking a slightly different flight plan towards soaring inspiration . it just can't quite get there on only one good wing . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
director : paul schrader . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 114 minutes . schrader forgot those things while adapting russell banks' affliction . working with all the elements for a raw dramatic masterwork , he appears unclear how to tell the story through to its conclusion . and in a fit of panic , he turns the final minutes of the film into a mess of ham-fisted plot summary and perplexing epilogue . it's a crying shame , because the set-up for affliction is so utterly compelling . the heart , soul and twisted guts of affliction lie in nick nolte's performance as wade , as beaten-down a human being as the screen has ever seen without turning him into a " lovable loser . " initially , the narration is simply florid and unnecessary ; later , it begins to repeat entire scenes just completed , as though afraid we might have just walked in from the lobby and missed something . finally , the narration becomes absolutely insufferable , summing up every theme from the previous two hours in a few tidy sentences that makes you wonder why you spent your time with wade instead of his self-appointed shrink . that narration is part of an attrocious conclusion that nearly ruins the film , tagging on explanations of much that has gone before and some that comes after . either schrader ran out of money to show us all this significant material , or he ran out of ideas regarding how to do it . perhaps such a gaping hole in the resolution of the protagonist's story should have ruined the film , but there's too much else that works in affliction . cinematographer paul sarossy , who captured russell banks' winter mindscapes previously in the sweet hereafter , captures a sense of chilly isolation , and the supporting cast -- notably coburn's casually emasculating turn as pop -- is solid top to bottom . there's an ache at the core of affliction as painful as the rotting tooth that , in a shakespearean display of psychic corruption manifested through physical corruption , torments wade through much of the film . there will also be an ache in the head of many viewers , as schrader spends the film's critical final minutes beating them with a moral to the story that anyone able to add single-digit numbers should comprehend unassisted . it may have worked for travis bickle , but here schrader's use of narration nearly trumps nolte's triumph . it's enough to make an edgy critic ask , " are you _still_ talkin' to me ?

screenplay : andrew kevin walker . producers : judy hofflund , gavin polone and joel schumacher . director : joel schumacher . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , violence , nudity ) running time : 121 minutes . i don't think i want to know what andrew kevin walker dreams about . as to joel schumacher's dreams , i think i can venture a pretty good guess . it would seem that the creative sensibilities of these two men couldn't be farther apart , which is one of the reasons 8mm feels like an edgy , intriguing missed opportunity . every time walker tries to drive the narrative into the realm of the unnerving , schumacher drags it back into the merely kinky . the premise for 8mm involves that most enduring of pornographic urban legends , the snuff film . cage is a great choice for a character like tom welles -- the capacity for lunatic action always seems to hide just behind his placid features -- but the character himself is something of a puzzle . if that question had been answered more effectively , 8mm might have struck a more resonant chord . as it stands , it's still a pretty gripping little thriller at times . the first hour pokes along at something of a crawl , which somehow works more often than it doesn't , perhaps because it's indicative of welles' tenacity . the supporting performances are solid , with joaquin phoenix making a savvy sidekick for welles , and peter stormare seething sleaze as a porn film director . the deliberate pacing eventually gives way to some tense showdowns as the film builds to its climax , including a search for a killer in which the driving sound of thrash metal music suddenly becomes the eerie metronome of the runout groove . 8mm is rarely a bore , and often finds the slick energy of the most effective dark action films . it's too bad that slickness works against 8mm nearly as often as it works for it . the bleak triumph of seven came not primarily through walker's fairly straightforward serial killer script , but through director david fincher's brilliantly subliminal direction ; the violence lurked at the edges of the frame , where our minds put gruesome pieces together . joel schumacher is a more grandiose sort of filmmaker , one who has no problem thrusting the details of an s&m film into the dead center of the screen . his version of the smoky basements where the hardcore deviants lurk is too literal , and indeed there's something about tom welles' entire journey that is too literal . the director isn't exactly trying to titillate the audience , but he's not helping the writer's study of how one man responds to the destruction of innocence . it may be enough that 8mm is just a decently constructed thriller . it's just not a gut-rattler , more the sort of thing you get when the director of batman & robin tries to do apocalyptic menace . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : pamela gray . director : tony goldwyn . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , nudity , profanity , adult themes , drug use ) running time : 105 minutes . a walk on the moon is a coming-of-age film , which may lead you to expect the fetishizing of adolescent sexual experimentation ; it's set during 1969's summer of love -- and at woodstock , no less -- which may lead you to expect even more " wonder years " -esque navel-gazing than usual . there are some pleasant surprises in a walk on the moon , actor tony goldwyn's directing debut , but the most pleasant may be that it's mature . taking a unique perspective on that singularly revolutionizing american summer , it's a simple , occasionally corny story with enough wisdom to realize that comings-of-age don't happen exclusively to teenagers . this summer seems certain to be something different , however . pearl's story is a particularly interesting one to set during a time of social upheaval . though gray occasionally turns her subtext into overly melodramatic text ( alison : " you had your chance to be the kid ! " pearl : " no , i didn't ! " ) , a walk on the moon generally lets diane lane's solid performance bring out pearl's conflicts . goldwyn also does a nice job of creating his 1960s catskills milieu as a distinct , amusing time and place . the portrayals do occasionally drift into the stereotypical , notably tovah feldshuh as marty's predictably iron-willed , oy-spouting mother , but the characters still maintain a sense of individuality even within their own world . when the throng of counterculture kids descends on this world for the generation-defining concert -- including a quick skinny-dip in the camp's private lake -- it provides a well-realized picture of the new freedom that calls to pearl . the only reason a walk on the moon feels awkward is that it fumbles the sub-plot involving alison's own adventures . they take a half-hearted middle ground when one of the two extremes -- focusing entirely on pearl or making the two stories equally significant -- would have been genuinely effective . fortunately , when a walk on the moon sticks with pearl's growth -- including getting to know who her husband _really_ is for the first time -- it's an appealing character study . from its atmosphere to its acting , it's a nicely grown-up story of growing up , not just physically but emotionally . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : marc lawrence , based on the original screenplay by neil simon . producers : robert evans , robert w . cort , david madden and teri schwartz . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , sexual situations , drug use ) running time : 88 minutes . the out-of-towners is the sort of film i generally greet with a generous helping of pooh-poohing . it's a remake ( of a neil simon-penned 1970 original which i have never seen ) , it's a vehicle to re-unite two stars of a previous film ( steve martin and goldie hawn , from 1992's housesitter ) , and it's a broad farce cloaked in shallow sentimentality . the out-of-towners often feels like it's working awfully hard to extract its guffaws , yet it still manages to extract its fair share . the comic energy of the three lead performers -- including the incomparable john cleese -- makes this silly trifle something moderately satisfying . it shouldn't be a surprise that the out-of-towners feels derivative , and not just because it's a remake . nearly every element in the film is designed to have the comfort of the familiar , from the pairing of the two stars , to martin's fuming in a planes , trains & automobiles scenario , to hawn's earnest ditziness , to cleese's resurrection of basil fawlty and python-esque cross-dressing . while the script by marc lawrence ( writer of forces of nature , who appears unusually fond of thwarted travel plans as an aphrodisiac ) pauses occasionally so henry and nancy can muse about the nature of their marriage , it's mostly concerned with set-ups for slapstick situations and tirades . at times , those situations and tirades feel forced ; you can practically see hawn and martin screaming to the audience for whoops and applause when they go on their respective rants against someone who gets their goat . at plenty of others , the actors give the old-fashioned farce a kick it rarely gets on screen . even more wonderful is cleese , a comic treasure too rarely seen . he may be able to do smiling misanthropes like his character here in his sleep , but he still sends a charge through the out-of-towners every moment he's on screen . cleese's scenes are reason alone for comedy fans to spend an hour and a half with this film . i do wish the out-of-towners had shown more restraint with its characters , subjecting them to a bit more frustration and a bit less abject humiliation . it's not a subtle film by any stretch of the imagination , but there was enough humor to be found in the performers that we didn't need to see martin taking a hallucinogenic trip with his pants around his ankles . you may find a lot of the out-of-towners familiar and foolish ; you may also find yourself laughing at it in spite of yourself . there's something to be said for the way talented professionals can take predictable material and wring something fresh and funny from it . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : ron peer and joel cohen & alec sokolow . director : roland joffe . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , adult themes , violence ) running time : 97 minutes . goodbye lover is the kind of nihilistic entertainment that gives you a few giggles while watching it , then leaves you feeling dirty for not loathing the whole enterprise . the reason nothing is what it appears to be is that goodbye lover is a film about twisty-turny plotting . . . and , essentially , that's _all_ it's about . it's the kind of stuff that usually makes a film interesting to watch thanks to its unpredictability , but goodbye lover becomes strangely predictable in its unpredictability . it's so instantly obvious that it's a film about hidden agendas that it becomes a matter of waiting until the next character's obviously hidden agenda is revealed . there's not much fun in the zigs and zags the story takes because every 20 minutes or so you know it's going to be time for the next zig or zag , and the next permutation in a series of unholy alliances . there's still something over-the-top goofy about goodbye lover which makes it possible to slip into its sociopathic world . the performance is only so-so , but the character is such a wild blend of madonna and whore that she's enjoyable to watch . ellen degeneres gets most of the prime punch lines as the embittered det . in fact , goodbye lover is so gleeful in its complete absence of humanity that it may take you a while after it's over before you feel the need to shower its decadence right off of yourself . it's too self-aware of its lack of real characters to inspire too much head-wagging , but it's still one of those films that finds it cool to set up the only person with an ounce of optimism as an object of ridicule . there's just enough residual cheesiness to keep the film in the realm of the surreal , with just enough bleak attitude to blunt its surreal appeal . it's not a thriller so much as it is an ultra-black comedy , where part of the joke is on you for leaving your moral outrage at the door . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : jacques fieschi , based on the novel by yukio mishima . director : benoit jacquot . film stories of improbable obsession are always tricky because they're so . . . well , so improbable . in a novel , it's easier to delve into tangled psychology through interior monologue or prose -- to understand , for instance , why a middle-aged man destroys his life for a teenager called lolita . there is also the secondary problem of giving a face to the object of desire , creating the possibility that the obsession just won't make any sense . a film about irrational passions has to immerse a viewer in that irrationality , even as it gives you some small sense that the irrationality is based on something understandable . their relationship twists and turns into something neither one can quite identify , though both need it desperately . exactly why they need it is not entirely clear . dominique is a more perplexing case . jacquot's direction , however , keeps us too distanced from dominique's obsession for it to make sense as anything more profound than a middle-aged fling . though the narrative toys with the provocative notion that the childless dominique is acting out a maternal fantasy as much as a sexual one , the script is too timid to attack that subtext . the school of flesh's academic detachment makes it difficult to feel her pain , whatever it might be . the school of flesh is not the first film to assert an unlikely man's attractiveness to women -- the entire woody allen oeuvre comes to mind -- but that doesn't make it any easier to accept this particular example . though martinez certainly isn't ugly , it's unlikely he'd be anyone's paradigm of masculine beauty ; he most closely resembles a slightly more swarthy joaquin phoenix . quentin's animal magnetism is central to the school of flesh's premise , yet i didn't notice enough magnetism to erase a computer disk . the school of flesh still manages to be somewhat engaging , simply because the relationship dynamics are effectively portrayed . it's rather touching watching quentin try to make dominique admit she'd discard him if he were ugly ; it's amusing watching dominique struggle to balance her desire for quentin with her embarrassment to be with him in public settings . both central characters are intriguing enough to follow , but it's hard to watch them both degrade themselves when it's not clear enough why they're doing it . obsession makes for great drama if the " why " is as important as the " what .

perhaps it's an indication of how far we have come , but gay coming-of-age films are becoming as formula-bound and potentially trite as straight coming-of-age films . have been there , and we have done that . to paraphrase my colleague mike d'angelo , we have to ask ourselves whether we would care about the people or the situation if the central romantic entaglements were heterosexual , and often the answer is no . gay or straight , " i was never the same after that summer " films often go nowhere new or interesting . edge of seventeen does try to take us somewhere new , exploring an angle most gay-themed films only view as an afterthought : how friends and family respond to a startling coming-out . in some ways , edge of seventeen is quite a conventional independent film examining gay subject matter . fortunately , even those scenes are sparked by the unaffected , appealing work of stafford in the lead role . his goofy innocence and teen-jim carrey grin generate surprising sympathy in eric's predicament as he begins exploring his sexuality in secret . the technical credits may be predictably shaky and the supporting performances uneven ( gabrych is somewhat wooden as eric's first love ) , but edge of seventeen manages to hold some interest in its story even when it's not revolutionary . . . and it is amusing to hear the bronski beat again . the really good news in edge of seventeen also turns out , ultimately , to be the bad news . the film's best two best performances emerge when stafford and director david moreton begin to address the confusion of those who don't know how to react when a loved one announces that he's gay . as sensitively as the filmmakers handle eric's various experimentations , none of them bear quite the emotional impact of the responses of these two women to eric's sexual orientation . in general , edge of seventeen feels neither revelatory nor redundant , merely unfolding with a simple honesty that makes it feel blandly familiar . the strength of two young performers -- particularly holmes , an actress to watch for -- elevates the film a bit above its like-themed kin , but not as much as a different focus might have done . if he had run with that unique angle , he might have been on to a really good film instead of a slightly-above-average story of how someone was never the same after that summer . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : mike figgis . director : mike figgis . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , sexual situations , violence , adult themes ) running time : 101 minutes . is the loss of sexual innocence , mike figgis' experimental non-linear tone poem , pretentious ? of course it is -- you've got to have a healthy streak of pretentiousness in you to break free from conventional narrative structure and make something so distinct that it's occasionally confounding . perhaps a better question is whether the loss of sexual innocence is nothing _but_ pretentious . even more so than in most films , the answer to that question will be an eye-of-the-beholder proposition . some will see little more than insufferable , gratuitous , iconoclastic noodling . others will see a film that grips you with many of its images even as it keeps you at an artistic arm's length . though there is no structured " story " to the loss of sexual innocence , there is a focal point in the character of nic , seen at various formative stages of his life . what may appear from that description to be a fragmented film actually feels surprisingly cohesive . figgis maintains a consistent tone for his various images , creating a collection of cinematic short stories as thematically connected as hemingway's _a moveable feast_ . the piano music of schumann and chopin trades places with figgis' own compositions , accentuating some magical cinematography by benoit delhomme . if you allow yourself to get lost in the loss of sexual innocence , and avoid succumbing to the temptation to figure out what everything " means , " it can wash over your resistance to its unconventionality . and , to be frank , some of it is just plain weird . instead of giving us a view of an inner life , the scenes play out like a parody of dream images , full of dissonant music and shifting realities like a years-too-late outtake from " twin peaks . " most baffling and annoying to some will be the garden of eden sequences , which conspicuously match a transluscently nordic eve with a strikingly black adam , both of whom are fully nude in every scene . there's nothing particularly revelatory about figgis' account of the fall but his interracial first parents , nothing visually compelling in his unblinking staredown with innocence personified . that's the level on which the loss of sexual innocence is bound to set to itching those who can't stand it when their art looks this in-your-face art-y . there are times when figgis' efforts grow wearying in their lack of basic resonance with the viewer's experiences . there are also times when he hits the nail spectacularly on the head , and times when the film works on an almost symphonic level . mike figgis wants to use the cinema the way only cinema can be used , and without question he does so . the extent to which this mixed bag of mourning and memory succeeds is a matter for _extremely_ subjective analysis . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : oliver parker , based on the play by oscar wilde . director : oliver parker . mpaa rating : pg ( mild profanity , adult themes ) running time : 96 minutes . an ideal husband is so determinedly droll that it's likely to leave your cheeks aching from a sustained 96 minute smirk . that shouldn't be a tremendous shock considering we're talking about a play by oscar wilde , whose penchant for the tres bon mot was matched only by his curious desire to cobble them together into plots . he was smart enough to craft his stories into a crowd-pleasing romantic form , but he was generally less interested in emotional insight than he was in a witty turn of phrase . in the mouths of actors who know how to use them , his epigrams can make you forget that the narrative you're watching is fairly forgettable . there are many such actors in an ideal husband , enough to give the tale some devilish fun . it's a noble idea , though the time isn't particularly well-spent . parker wants us to feel for them , while i suspect wilde is more interested in making them look a bit foolish . playing the characters with too much sincerity may be too " heavy " a reading of the material . fortunately , parker still has plenty of juicy wilde-ian dialogue to distribute . many actors have opted to play wilde with an eyebrow arched into the flight path passenger jets , as though we all must know they view life itself as a grand joke . everett smartly opts for a refined weariness , the cynicism of a man who doesn't take much pleasure in his cynicism . it's a choice that makes his later romance with mabel ( played with beautiful intelligence by driver ) feel less like a plot device than it has any right to . it's true that a little droll can go an awfully long way , and that an ideal husband hardly offers a riveting portrait of scandal and redemption . mostly it's a comedy of manners , one of wilde's forrays into the difference between our public and private faces ( a subject with which he was well acquainted ) . though parker's pacing lags between gags , there is just enough surprisingly modern satire -- and just enough rupert everett -- to maintain interest . the chuckles may rarely turn into belly laughs , but then again , that never was wilde's style . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
in my review of john sayles' 1996 film lone star , i wrote that my initial frustration with the film must have meant that i missed something . such was my confidence in sayles' storytelling that i was convinced i could find the unifying thematic thread if i just pondered long enough . in that particular case , i was right . sayles' new film limbo presented me with the same initial frustration , and the same determination to find the one piece that would turn the merely intriguing into the truly brilliant . and it just wasn't there . for the first hour , there are plenty of reasons to believe limbo could be the latest thematically rich cinematic sayles novel . here , alaska has at least two faces : the raw , blank-slate wilderness that provides escape and opportunity for new beginnings , and the tourist attraction that provides a sanitized version of that wilderness . sayles offers plenty of local color with his supporting characters , but it's the way those characters interact with the place that gives limbo weight . for half the film , limbo sets a tentative romance against a backdrop of civilization trying to claim one of the few remaining frontiers , even as residents who should know better keep searching for a predictability that just isn't there . i suppose you could see the second half as sayles' attempt to show just how far civilization has to go , if you were feeling particularly generous . even worse , the links to the first half's portrait of alaska at a cultural crossroads become tenuous at best . the second half is solid enough , but it's a jarring shift . instead of a novel , sayles has written two short stories slammed together in an uncomfortable fit . john sayles' films are always comparative pleasures in the bigger picture of filmmaking , with their smart dialogue and attention to human detail . sayles has also become a more visually interesting director with every film , turning in at least one hypnotically beautiful sequence of joe returning to fishing ( another triumph for cinematographer haskell wexler ) . he can say fascinating things both with his dialogue and his camera . in limbo , all those fascinating things just don't add up to a fascinating , unified story . limbo isn't a disappointment because he doesn't say enough , as in the ambiguous final shot . it's a disappointment because he tries to say too much . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
director : spike lee . i see spike lee working . i have a pretty good idea what he was up to with summer of sam . it would be a tale of how paranoia can amplify the xenophobia that already exists in so many people . it would be both ambitious and intimate , both a period piece and a piece of who we still are . it would be an important film . i see spike lee working , and i saw summer of sam working . . . up to a point . for a while , the stories of lee's two main characters are promising enough that summer of sam keeps you watching . leguizamo is particularly strong in his role ( will someone _please_ put this guy's talent to good use ? ) , but both characters work in juxtaposition to the son of sam -- they're anti-social people who happen to functionally anti-socials . though the period production design comes and goes , there's still a strong sense of this particular time and place in new york . we see 1977 as a more intense period in the life of the city , when the thin connecting thread of rooting for the yankees was always ready to snap into violence . there are lots of big issues moving through summer of sam , and lee is ready to make sure we always know it . lee even opens with an extended crane shot that serves as a big flashing red light that the director wants touch of evil/boogie nights respect for his project . lee may be talented , but his pure id approach to directing leads to some baffling decisions . no decision in summer of sam is more baffling -- or more harmful to the film -- than lee's portrayal of berkowitz himself . it was a risky enough maneuver introducing berkowitz as a character at all rather than leaving him as a bogeyman haunting the periphery of the film ; it was even riskier to show him freaking out in his apartment . that scene turns a killer's demented rampage into absurdist comedy , making you wonder what the hell lee was thinking . at times it gels into a gripping film . at other times , you can see lee working . . . and you can see him working far too hard . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
it's easy enough to adopt the head-shaking perspective that the muppets just ain't what they used to be . certainly the death of jim henson left a void in the muppet universe , but it's only fitting that the show has gone on . " the muppet show's " setting as an old-time vaudeville revue wasn't just a goofy conceit ; it exemplified the whole muppet philosophy . sure , the scattershot jokes and variety numbers could be groaners , but they were delivered with such a pure desire to please that it almost didn't matter . the muppets were -- and continue to be -- entertainment from a bygone era , where you rarely had to target kids exclusively because virtually all entertainment was " family entertainment . " muppets from space is a broad , silly , fairly charming piece of muppet capering based on a 20-year-old running gag : exactly what is gonzo ( dave goelz ) anyway ? the premise sets up jokes targeted at just about every " aliens among us " movie of the last 25 years . sly pop culture references and slapstick carry most of the humor , but there's also the simple pleasure of the company of familiar characters . when kermit , fozzie and miss piggy lead a mission to rescue gonzo , the history of those characters somehow makes every simple joke that much funnier . it's also true that muppets from space has an inconsistent tone and a higher-than-usual ratio of duds to chuckles . the use of a musical score full of 70s soul classics like " brick house " and " celebration " feels forced , since the muppets are anything but funky . and as hard as the post-henson muppet gang has worked to make gonzo the new protagonist , he just doesn't have the warmth and appeal of kermit , who's now relegated to a sort of elder statesman role . muppets from space can keep you smiling , but it rarely hits the high points of classic anarchic muppet wit . still , there's enough subtly subversive humor in muppets from space -- as well as enough wild sight gags -- to make you glad the muppets are still around . the film's best , most cultural crusader-unfriendly joke finds gonzo admitting to his pals that " i guess i've always had alien tendencies . . . this just seems natural to me . " those who have fretted for years that bert and ernie were actually lovers may furrow their brows at such alternative lifestyle innuendo , but it's a perfect nod to the kind of unconventional family the muppets have always been . then again , that's the kind of bond theater people often form , and the muppets are nothing if not true theater people . okay , not _people_ exactly . . . just entertainers who remind you that it's a good thing for the show to go on . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
it's tough to knock a funny film for being not nearly as funny as it could have been -- or thinks it is -- but that's ultimately the problem with drop dead gorgeous . it would be easy enough to call drop dead gorgeous a second-rate gloss on michael ritchie's smile , or a wannabe waiting for guffman , or a half-hearted the positively true adventures of the alleged texas cheerleader-murdering mom ( also , not coincidentally , directed by michael ritchie ) . such criticisms don't do justice to the number of belly laughs this film provides . by the time the talent portion of the competition rolls around -- complete with dog impressions and monologues from soylent green -- drop dead gorgeous has provided enough humor to avoid being buried by comparative criticism . the thing about those comparitive criticisms is that you'd also be right . as scripted by lona williams -- herself a former minnesota beauty contest participant -- the film takes on too many targets to skewer any of them with maximum effectiveness . the peek at pageant contestants finds only the occasional insight , opting instead for broad caricatures and even broader gags . in fact , director michael patrick jann almost always opts for over-the-top , making the documentary set-up seem completely inappropriate . it's impossible to get caught up in drop dead gorgeous's verisimilitude when the action arbitrarily switches to rapid-fire , multiple-angle edits the likes of which i've never seen in any documentary . it's that aggravating refusal to look for genuine humor that makes drop dead gorgeous so frustrating . when it's funny , it's quite entertaining , but there's always the suspicion that it could have been hilarious with a bit of care . every joke made in drop dead gorgeous made me think of a joke missed ; every raucous chuckle called to mind an even better sly snicker . it's like a vaudeville act that will do anything to please the crowd , only it's a vaudeville act that thinks it's a wicked satire . you'll laugh , you'll sigh , you'll think about the better films covering similar subject matter . this may be one of the least satisfying entertaining films of recent years . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
director : kinka usher . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , mild profanity , adult humor ) running time : 117 minutes . of all the reasons to be frustrated by a film , i'll take the one mystery men provides : it's just too clever and original for its own damned good . the super-hero action film has become such a predictable package of action sequences , limp quips and bland characterizations that it was screaming for a satirical treament . to fill this need , along comes mystery men , spinning out a dozen different ways to turn the genre on its ear . . . which turns out to be at least a half-dozen too many . as busily directed by television commercial auteur kinka usher , mystery men rarely sits still long enough for any one of its sharp ideas to turn into inspired comedy . the concept , based on characters appearing in dark horse comics , offers plenty of potential . mystery men works best from the outset by turning its super-heroes into analogs for contemporary athletes . every so often , mystery men nails the absurdity of its premise so well that the comedy is blissfully perfect . it's just not often enough . as the film winds its way through two hours , its comic highlights are nearly matched by the unexplored sub-plots . lost in the shuffle of too many characters are the team's two over-eager tag-alongs , the geeky spleen and earnest invisible boy ( whose " powers " may be nothing more than a major case of teenage existential angst ) . neil cuthbert's script spends too much time on the sphinx's initially amusing yoda-like training , and too little on kinnear's splendidly smug captain amazing . rush's cassanova frankenstein hardly gets a moment to develop a distinct personality , treating his teutonic accent as sufficient evidence of his villainy . mystery men wants to make every possible gag about super-heroes in one film , but it's off on the next set-up before you get a chance to appreciate the last punch line . thankfully , there are just enough quirky pleasures in mystery men to counteract its hyperactivity . a cast like stiller , garofalo , macy and azaria guarantees more oddball enjoyment than most films could deliver , but they could have been part of a cult classic . it's ironic that a parody of summer movie overkill is guilty of some of the same sins . you can't swing for the fences every time , especially if you're a minor leaguer trying to make it to " the show . " sometimes , you've gotta take one for the team . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : andrew fleming and sheryl longin . director : andrew fleming . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , drug use , adult themes , adult humor ) running time : 94 minutes . this may be a first in my six years as a film critic : i'm going to give the bulk of the credit for a film's success to the casting director . the film is dick , a political/historical satire with a sporadically amusing script and competent enough direction -- in short , the stuff of fairly average entertainment . if dick pushes over the edge of average-ness , it's because the cast dives into the material with such gusto that the film finds sparks of inspired comedy . casting director pam dixon mickelson has stocked dick with such a wealth of talent that it's fun just watching them stroll into the shot . the premise is silly high-concept stuff , centered around two high school best friends in washington d . c . circa 1972 -- simple-minded arlene lorenzo ( michelle williams ) and even more simple-minded betsy jobs ( kirsten dunst ) . the gag is pretty thin to begin with , and it's not even particularly original . it's all good for a few knowing chuckles , but once you tune into the pattern , you can see virtually every joke coming from several minutes away . what you can't necessarily see coming is the appeal of the performances . the key players in the administration are all played with zest by a wonderful comic cast -- hedaya as a tragically unhip nixon , harry shearer as a paranoid g . gordon liddy , breuer as the guilt-stricken john dean , saul rubinek as an insecure henry kissinger . more entertaining still are ferrell and mcculloch as woodward and bernstein , playing the two reporters as feuding glory hounds with a relationship somewhere between sibling rivals and closeted lovers . and in the middle of this who's who of sketch comedy alumni , michelle williams and kirsten dunst have tremendous fun with their ditzy characters . dunst may be the more accomplished actress of the two , but it's williams who gets the juicier part of a teen who develops a secret crush on nixon . there's nothing quite as incongruously funny as arlene's fantasy of a scowling dick riding across a beach on a white stallion . it would have been nice if andrew fleming and sheryl longin's script had found more scenes to match that one for sheer goofiness value . too often it gets a bit lazy , opting for yet another historical coulda-been or one of many comic uses of the name " dick . " dick hits a few dead spots , but whenever it starts to lag it gets a jolt from the energetic cast . remember the name pam dixon mickelson if you happen to be casting a comedy any time soon . it's nice to have someone who can gather an all-star team for the comedic equivalent of slow-pitch softball . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : carl v . dupre . director : adam rifkin . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , drug use , adult themes , nudity , violence , sexual situations ) running time : 95 minutes . by any objective standard -- assuming the term isn't meaningless as it applies to film criticism -- detroit rock city is pretty inexcusable stuff . the humor sticks fairly consistently to drugs , alcohol , and other undesirable teen behavior . the four principal characters have little or no personality , and aren't terribly sympathetic . it's a frantically paced effort , the infantile gags thrown around with a " quantity beats quality " mentality . a sensible adult human being clearly would be well-advised to hurl himself as far from this film as possible . there are far worse models for a film of this kind . detroit rock city is a dumb film , but it's a dumb film with such high energy and such a shamelessly low-brow sensibility that it feels like exactly the kind of film american pie wanted to be . teenage viewers may be content to snigger at the sex , drugs and rock 'n' roll gags , but the cartoonish delivery of those gags makes them more fun than they have any right to be . then again , i viewed detroit rock city through some fairly rose-tinted spectacles . though sporadically guffaw-inducing as a teen sex farce , it's far more appealing as a pure nostalgia trip for a 30-something ex-headbanger . the soundtrack , though heavy on the kiss tunes , also delivers blue oyster cult , cheap trick , thin lizzy and the aforementioned ramones , not to mention the occasional disco selection . the 70's icons -- 8-track tapes , stretch armstrong action figures and farrah fawcett posters among them -- set just the right atmosphere . it's filled with throwaway kiss references only a true fan could love , like trip's ironic , pre- " i was made for lovin' you " insistence that " kiss would never do some bull * * * * disco song . " in all the ways that count , you really did have to be there . it would be easy enough to begin and end with the idea that i was bored and/or repulsed by detroit rock city , annoyed by the projectile vomiting humor and the limp dialogue . i could rightly acknowledge my frustration with set-ups designed mostly to work teenage boys into a lather of lust or disgust . and i could note that while the performers work hard to be appealing , there's just not much appealing about the characters . when it comes right down to it , the four teens are just types , representations of everyone who wanted to go to a kiss concert so bad they could taste the flashpot smoke . . . guys like me , for instance . detroit rock city isn't a good film , but it's a film i couldn't resist . as hard as it is under the best of circumstances to watch a film objectively , it's even harder when you're watching the story of your life . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : m . night shyamalan . director : m . night shyamalan . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , brief nudity ) running time : 110 minutes . [warning : the very nature of this review may involve plot spoilers for viewers who have not yet seen the film . ] of all the benefits i have received from being a film critic , i may value innocence the most . it may seem an odd choice of words in a profession more often associated with cynicism , but it applies nonetheless . while the onslaught of studio publicity is impossible to avoid completely , the ability to attend press screenings serves as something of a buffer against expectations . it was impossible for me to react to the blair witch hype since i had written my review six months before its release ; i never needed to guard against becoming aware of key crying game-esque plot points . it was possible for my viewing experience to remain relative untainted , subject only to pre-conceived notions for which i could have no one but myself to blame . it took the release of the sixth sense for me to realize how much that innocence can matter . reviews and discussions meticulously avoided revealing the specific nature of the ending , but by then the damage had been done . i considered everything i knew about the film , and made an educated guess regarding what would be revealed in its closing moments . then i finally caught up with the film , and watched with my " can i out-guess the writer " glasses on . within twenty minutes , it was obvious that i had guessed correctly . i'm not going to suggest that it was particularly clever of me to figure it out . i will suggest that i probably wouldn't have been testing my cleverness if i hadn't known there was something to be figured out . the simple knowledge that there was a plot point to be sussed out set me to sussing . and i spent as much of the film nodding to myself at the clues i recognized as i did trying to get caught up in the story . the nature of the film made such behavior both a blessing and a curse . writer/director m . night shyamalan's pacing is so agonizingly deliberate that i was delighted to have something else on which to train my attention . conversely , i was able to give bruce willis's monotonous performance a bit more benefit of the doubt , and admire the craft which allowed shyamalan's little trick to seem plausible . the only constant to draw me from my reverie was osment , a sublimely effective child actor whose performance alone is enough to recommend the sixth sense . children in jeopardy are usually a narrative cheat , but osment's reactions to his situation are always more compelling than shyamalan's few moments of thriller gimmickry . the irony is that my connection with cole's plight was consistently undercut by my awareness that the film's payoff would focus on someone else . perhaps my long-standing aversion to physician-heal-thyself psychologist/psychiatrist characters ( coincidentally sparked by another willis film , the ghastly color of night ) turned me off to malcolm as an equal player in the story . perhaps the supernaturally comforting closing shot reminded me too much of ghost . or perhaps i never bought the entire arc of malcolm's story from the outset . it's hard for me to know whether it was the film itself or my constant view of its wires which left me unimpressed . the success of the sixth sense suggests that it has struck an emotional chord in many viewers . for me , the only chords it could strike were technical . there was a not-particularly-inspired gag often used by titanic detractors during its theatrical run , something along the lines of " what's the point , you know the boat's going to sink . " most of the time , it's even true . next time , i hope i don't go into a film knowing whether or not the boat is going to sink . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
yes , it's true -- stir of echoes features a child who sees dead people . it includes in its metaphysics the notion that disgruntled spirits cause chilly temperatures in the human world . it is at least partially a tale of a wrongful death made right . depending on where you fall in the old glass half-full/half-empty argument , stir of echoes is the beneficiary of either extraordinarily good timing or extraordinarily bad timing . maybe comparisons with mega-success the sixth sense will doom it to obscurity . or maybe a spillover effect , with movie-goers still hungry for supernatural subject matter , will present it with an audience it might not otherwise have had . for my money , viewers can't go far wrong either way . if they go , they'll be moderately satisfied ; if they don't go , they won't be missing all that much . it's awfully easy to dwell on the similarities between stir of echoes and the sixth sense , weighing in simply with whether the former is better or worse than the latter . it would be easier to ignore those similarities if the whole film didn't feel overly familiar . that doesn't change the way stir of echoes is likely to be viewed today : a mish-mash of familiar elements . that's not to say that stir of echoes isn't also a reasonably effective thriller in its own conventional way . david koepp , who helmed the unsettling and little-seen trigger effect , has a knack for crafting a scene that gets under your skin without resorting to too many shock cuts . he also draws nice work from a solid cast , particularly erbe adding a few shadings to the thankless wife role . koepp's direction may get a little showy -- jittery time-lapse shots of ghosts , funky business in the " theater " of tom's hypnotic trance -- but it does its job manufacturing the creeps . it ain't deep , but it's scary enough . unfortunately for stir of echoes , it's less effective than it could be because koepp seems to think it _is_ deep . the subtext of joe six-pack tom seeing his new gift as a shot at finally doing something extraordinary comes and goes , and it's hard to see anything voluntary in his character arc . bacon's performance suffers from this erratic motivation -- he's reasonably convincing both in his terror and in his determination , but the two never come together . by the time koepp trots out an extended flashback of a crime in progress , his melodrama has bogged down the chills . ironically , that's yet another way stir of echoes is like the sixth sense : it's a moderately clever genre diversion that wants us to believe it's something more . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : david o . russell . director : david o . russell . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 111 minutes . it was all night-vision and smart-bombs , desert shields and protections of sovereignty -- a just war waged against a power-mad dictator . there's more than a little irony to the fact that three kings is just as visually striking as the gulf war , and nearly as shaky in its substance . sgt . special forces capt . archie gates ( george clooney ) also learns of the map , but believes there's far more to be had than cell phones and rolexes -- specifically , bunkers filled with millions in gold bullion . as a moderately revisionist history lesson , there's no question that three kings both engages and enlightens . provocative moral dilemmas abound in three kings , which should be the stuff of compelling drama . somehow , it just isn't . the messages are similar to those familiar from anti-war films like paths of glory , m * a * s * h and platoon -- war is even more hellish when policy has little to do with humanity -- yet the characters are not nearly as strong . he can also create plenty of urgency with his stylistic flourishes , of which plenty abound . three kings is a genuinely eye-catching piece of work in which russell makes bold choices to drive home a point , from the graphic internal images of a wounded body to the slow-motion punctuation of bullet wounds as video game warfare tears through real flesh . unfortunately , the same impulse to drive a point home leads to scenes in which a scene described in dialogue is simultaneously portrayed on screen . in retrospect , i'm not sure why i still admired three kings as much as i did . it's certainly an unconventional film , zig-zagging between dark comedy and raw drama with surprising effectiveness . every once in a while , russell will do one of those little things that remind you how invigorating cinema can be . there's just not enough to shake the sense that three kings is too enamored of its sense of historical importance . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : ed stone , phil reeves and mark illsley . director : mark illsley . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity ) running time : 98 minutes . it is entirely likely that few viewers will think of happy , texas as an instantly dated comedy . they'll laugh along with the broad humor , letting the premise take them along on all its wacky misunderstandings and complications . they'll roar like the audience member in front of me at the incongruous situations . and while there are plenty of things that are worth a chuckle in happy , texas , there is this one glaring issue that made it impossible for me to surrender completely to its zaniness . you see , in happy , texas , homosexuality itself is the punch line . it's a superbly cast feature-length episode of " three's company . " naturally , harry and wayne's role-playing leads to confusion and awkward moments . some of those moments are indeed very funny , particularly wayne's spastic first attempts at choreography and his brusque manner with the children ; others are ridiculously trite , like the number of occasions in which harry and wayne are caught in what appears to others to be a tender moment . when the film builds towards a will-they-or-won't-they involving harry and jo , the more appropriate question given the slapdash efforts at building harry's character arc , is why-should-we-care . the reason nothing has any resonance , or even much humanity to the belly laughs , is that happy , texas seems entirely content to be a sit-com . instead , you can feel the audience responding giddily to the mere idea of one man touching another , to the sight of a gay bar , to chappy and harry slow dancing . the wonderfully talented macy invests chappy with far more warmth and dignity than the character deserves , but there's something disconcerting about the whole enterprise . i was left watching a fish-out-of-water comedy in which the land animals weren't in on the jokes at the fishes' expense . at least by that point the film has surrendered to its lowbrow sensibilities , making for a raucous comedy with little subtlety . the talent in the cast keeps sparking happy , texas to comic high notes -- macy , as already noted , is utterly charming ; zahn is a delightfully high-strung and bug-eyed -- yet those notes rarely blend into a happy tune . i can't imagine the film played that way on the page with this many gifted actors interested , but happy , texas offers the same situations john ritter turned into laugh-track gold 20 years ago . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : alan zweibel and jessie nelson . director : rob reiner . it is a wonderfully affecting moment , beautifully performed by pfeiffer with all the love and frustration that makes up a marriage . it's also a moment that is a complete cheat . theoretically , the story of us is the story of how easy it is , in the middle of all the white noise and tension of everyday life , to lose track of why you fell in love with someone in the first place . unfortunately , it's such a fragmented narrative that it's just as easy for the _audience_ to lose track of why they fell in love in the first place . the script by alan zweibel and jessie nelson sprinkles flashbacks through the summer of the jordan's separation -- a peek at their meeting and first date here , an interrupted dalliance on the butcher block there -- but there aren't nearly enough of them . the story of us spends virtually all its time showing us the relationship already in trouble , making it incredibly difficult to appreciate what made the relationship good in the first place . we're asked to invest ourselves emotionally in the success or failure of the jordans' marriage without getting enough evidence that it should succeed . it's even more frustrating to realize that the story of us is so solid at its core that it could have been wonderful . the film is not always a pleasant experience , showing off some extremely unfair fighting between its protagonists and the wrenching moments when emotional damage seems beyond repair . willis and pfeiffer deftly turn their post-separation scenes into awkward shuffles between longing and despair ; where most films treat divorce either as all-acrimony or all-indifference , this one captures how much people want it all to work out . but at only 92 minutes , the story of us feels bereft of context . somewhere on the cutting room floor is the arc of a relationshp from affection to simple coexistence to a blur of petty bickering . if only more of the so-called humor had found its way to the same floor . wilson rants about how men never change the toilet paper roll , a gag that hasn't gotten any fresher since it was generated by bad stand-up comics 20 years ago . reiner waxes philosophical about how " there is no ass , just the fleshy tops of your legs . " reiser spends five minutes degrading an idea for a book about ben's grandparents , inspiring only stony silence from the audience . reiner and his writers keep trying so hard to lighten the mood they only end up breaking it , with little to show for their efforts but a few half-hearted chuckles . it's easy to see the comedy as part of reiner's attempt to create a companion piece to his 1989 gem when harry met sally . with its direct addresses to the camera and hairdo-change time lapses , the story of us does sometimes feel like when harry left sally . yet while this film was unlikely to be as purely entertaining , it could have been far more resonant . some of the individual scenes in the story of us are heartbreaking , and a few are truly charming . they just never quite add up to the story of them in a way that provides real catharsis . it's easy to understand why those snippets would move katie to tears ; after all , she lived those moments . the story of us could have moved us all if only we'd been allowed to live them , too . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
director : martin scorsese . if the opening minutes of bringing out the dead start to look very familiar , you're not alone -- even martin scorsese agrees with you . " there's a correlation to taxi driver , there's no doubt , " scorsese comments in the press notes , which admission can only inspire a sarcastic , " no , really ? " for a while , you suspect the film should be called ambulance driver . scorsese ultimately takes bringing out the dead somewhere quite different , which is both a blessing and a disappointment . much of the film is spent on the day-to-day -- or , in this case , night-to-night -- life of the paramedics , and on that level it's often fascinating and brutally hilarious . even the trips into the our lady of perpetual mercy emergency room -- a barely-controlled bedlam that would send even the " er " cast screaming for the hills -- pound home the nightmare of the job . when scorsese and cinematographer robert richardson keep their eyes trained on the kinetic , frenetic world of pierce and his cohorts , bringing out the dead has the darkly comic vibe of m * a * s * h , providing entertaining ( if occasionally unnerving ) insight into a violent world where the only sane response is to go a little insane . there is , however , a backbone to this story , if not an exceptionally strong one . cage delivers a performance that is alternately wild-eyed and catatonic , a frustrating pastiche of previous cage roles instead of a distinct character of its own . scorsese and schrader really miss the mark in the film's final minutes , when frank's epiphany becomes a depressingly obvious combination of glinda-the-good-witch dialogue and purifying white light . it's all well and good that scorsese and shrader claim they've " a little mellower now , " and that 25 years after taxi driver they've opted for something a bit less bleakly pessimistic . there's plenty of visual gusto to bringing out the dead , and there are plenty of wildly entertaining episodes to keep you watching . it's just hard not to wish for a personality half as intensely memorable as bickle to pull it all together . whenever frank's introspections take center stage , you need to keep rousing yourself to ask , " are you talkin' to me ?

director : jon turtletaub . you'd think disney could mail it in by now . " underdog makes good " comedies have been a staple of the studio's live-action repertoire from the absent-minded professor to gus to the mighty ducks . that a significant portion of their audience wouldn't notice if they * did * mail it in makes it all the more impressive that they don't . cool runnings carries on a tradition of formula comedies exuding good-natured energy , and entertaining more than they have any right to . anyone who has ever seen a disney sports film , or almost any sports film for that matter , can tell you more or less exactly what to expect . there will be a hissable , cartoonish villain who questions our heroes' mettle ( do you think he'll get his comeuppance ? ) . no one goes to these films to be overwhelmed by the originality of the story . it's all about positive feeling , and cool runnings delivers it . the slapstick training runs are lively , enough so that the youngsters in my audience were screaming with delight . the bobsled footage is superb , and the olympic village atmosphere is exciting . jamaica is disney-fied into an idealized , colorful paradise replete with grinning waifs and free of most signs of poverty , but it's brightly filmed and after all , this isn't a film which offers much in the way of social commentary . leon is a bit stiff but still appealing as the determined team leader . malik yuba glowers and grumbles effectively as yul , and rawle e . lewis' junior is jittery and expressive . doug e . doug gets the comic relief role as sanka , and proves to be a winning presence . in the past , candy's name in the credits has been almost as sure a sign of a comedy i'll hate as mickey rourke's has been of a drama i'll hate . here candy plays the straight man instead of the buffoon , and plays it well . it doesn't take much imagination to buy candy as a has-been * anything * , but he's more than just serviceable . he plays blitzer surprisingly understated , even when giving the obligatory inspirational speeches , and allows the rest of the cast to carry most of the comedy . i could spend plenty of time nitpicking about what cool runnings didn't do , or should have done . the real story behind the formation of the team is far less " hollywood , " and that's not the only historical fact with which the film plays fast and loose . but for my money , the most important factor was that i left the theater smiling and feeling uplifted . it's a film about success coming from hard work and determination , and it's a film i would be glad to take a family to see . that's a rarity , and it's worth praise on its own level . 
screenplay : neil gaiman , adapted from the screenplay by hayao miyazaki . director : hayao miyazaki . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 136 minutes . somehow , somewhere , this whole " anime " wave has left me behind . sure , the japanese animation style is distinctive , but it strikes me that the form has not progressed radically in the 30 years since " speed racer . " though the backgrounds may have become richer , there's still a vaguely anglicized blandness to the character design , a strange lack of fluidity to the acrobatic movements . when the japanese smash princess mononoke made its way to our shores , it was spoken of as the future of animation . i was skeptical that it would bring anything that wasn't already the past of anime . from an animation standpoint , i still think that's true , though princess mononoke does have some striking imagery . the real revelation in the film is the depth and complexity of its mythology and storytelling , which manage to overcome the problems with the human story . in case there is any confusion on the subject , let's be clear that princess mononoke is a film for adults . it also maintains an adult tone in the set-up of its mystical world , with gods who can be petulant , violent and even just plain stupid ( a cosmology far more in keeping with most ancient civilizations' mythologies than disney's benign pantheisms ) . most impressive , miyazaki keeps his story free of the didacticism so common in films with environmental themes . rare is the tale that suggests industry could be a co-existing entity in nature , rather than an inherent evil . princess mononoke is so engrossing as both legend and lesson that you wish it could treat its characters with more care . the line readings by the english actors are flat and constricted , performances set to a stopwatch of mouth movements instead of to the needs of the scene . and then there's the dialogue , which generally ranges from the annoyingly literalist ( characters seem incapable of looking at a thing without calling out its name ) to the purely giggle-inducing ( i don't believe i'll ever embrace unreservedly a film that includes the line , " forest spirit , we give you back your head " ) . princess mononoke at times appears to be an animated variation on this year's more ballyhooed version of mythopoetics over substance , the phantom menace . still , there is something compelling about the look of princess mononoke , more so than i was expecting . the design of the supernatural characters is always intriguing , from the writhing worm-bodies of the demons to the pillsbury doughboy-cum-tiki-idol sprites called the kodamas ; the battlefields are arresting in their gore-spattered silence . indeed , silence plays an unexpectedly effective role in this epic film , giving it a sense of reverence . there's just the problem of those darned people , whose homogeneity in word and countenance hinders an otherwise stellar effort . anime may be more or less what it used to be , but at least the storytelling behind it is growing up . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
starring : jeremy irons , john lone . director : david cronenberg . i approached the film version of m . butterfly with something of a " show me " attitude . i'd had the good fortune to see a sensational production of the play by northern california's theatreworks company , with an amazing lead performance by mark capri as gallimard , and i felt that any other version would have to be pretty good to impress me . i also questioned the choice of david cronenberg , whose previous efforts had all been horror films , as director . it therefore comes as a pleasant surprise that cronenberg's m . butterfly maintains a real faithfulness to the basic themes of david henry hwang's tony award-winning play , although it loses a great deal from the absence of the stage version's brechtian devices . it's useless to argue that the story is implausible , based as it is on a real event ; m . butterfly is itself an attempt to explain how it could have happened . hwang's conclusion is that the boursicot/gallimard story is inextricably tied to the perception westerners hold of the east , that of a culture of subservience . consequently , they think of all asians as feminized , making gallimard's assumption of song's gender purely cultural . hwang and cronenberg convey that sense of western sexual/political arrogance in lines which draw knowing chuckles , such as gallimard's assurance to his superior that the vietnamese would " submit to any show of strength " by the americans . it's an interesting theme well-explored . where i felt m . butterfly was less successful was in portraying the complexities of gallimard's character . in the play , he speaks directly to the audience , a device which allows for some ironic observations of his state of mind . the film's more conventional narrative approach makes gallimard less pathetic than he should be . without this aspect of his personality evident , his vulnerability to the deception doesn't make as much sense . there should be a clear sense that psychologically , he * needs * song to be a woman , and it's not quite there . such an emphasis on gallimard's psychology would also have gone far toward making john lone a credible choice as song . lone's voice has an eerie , detached quality which i liked for its mysterious allure , but the fact is that he just looks too masculine , and an eight foot high close-up doesn't exactly promote illusion . irons is a much better choice as gallimard . m . butterfly is a fascinating story , and its screen telling is more than fair to the stage spirit . i only wish hwang had been allowed to keep the focus on the internal . it's a good film that could have been a very good one . 
screenplay : david o'malley . director : carl reiner . never underestimate the power of expectations . in the wake of hot shots ! part deux , loaded weapon 1 and robin hood : men in tights , i viewed yet another genre parody as cruel and inhuman punishment , and awaited fatal instinct with utter dread . then , much to my astonishment , it didn't stink . oh , make no mistake : fatal instinct isn't particularly good . i simply laughed much more than i expected to . how's that for damning with faint praise ? the " plot " of fatal instinct is a pastiche of elements from contemporary sexual thrillers and classic film noir . the naked gun ) demonstrated sucessful application of a fundamental rule for the form : keep the gags coming so fast that you don't have time to notice the lousy ones . fatal instinct owes its successes , small as they may be , to adherence to this principal . there are plenty of duds in fatal instinct , but the pacing is lively enough that they don't sit there waiting for an audience reaction that's never going to come . director carl reiner hasn't shown a consistent talent for comic pacing in his feature film career ; for every where's poppa ? or all of me , there has been a summer school or sibling rivalry . fortunately , the carl reiner who helped steve martin's early parodies click is at work here . he keeps everything moving , avoiding the error that sank men in tights . those zaz classics had one other important thing going for them , namely well-known dramatic actors like leslie nielsen and lloyd bridges playing a brilliant deadpan mockery of their own b-movie roles . armand assante is a better dramatic actor than nielsen or bridges , but he too turns in a fine spoof of one of the lowlights on his resume , the dopey mike hammer tale i , the jury . he seems to have a great deal of fun mocking the image of the sullen detective , and pulls off some surprisingly deft physical comedy . perhaps half my enjoyment of fatal instinct came from appreciating the career subtext of these two performances . before it seems as though i have nothing but kind words for fatal instinct , there is one major thing lacking : originality . its primary satirical targets are basic instinct , fatal attraction and cape fear , each of which has been done in other recent films or tv's " the simpsons . " granted , the scripts were in production simultaneously , but much of the freshness is still lost . there are also some tedious " lotsies , " those sequences of progressively sillier events a la o . j . simpson's ill-fated boat investigation at the beginning of the naked gun . there was a moment near the climax when i was waiting for an almost too-obvious gag which * still * would have been funny , but screenwriter david o'malley missed his opportunity . in retrospect , i almost feel guilty about some of the places i laughed . it's hard to explain how a line like , " i'll try to help you , miss cain , if i'm able , " can seem funny , but it did . i don't know ; maybe they were expecting too much . 
mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 183 minutes . in a way , you've got to admire frank darabont's chutzpah . another stephen king period piece adaptation . as if a successful rookie director didn't face enough of a challenge from high expectations , darabont practically threw audiences and critics a dare : " go ahead -- say 'it's no shawshank . ' " his incredibly nervy choice almost works . . . almost . you're sure to see plenty of gripes about the green mile that focus on its three-hour-plus running time . it's a common and understandable complaint in a year when 150+ minute running times are becoming standard in " prestige films . " however , the problem with the green mile isn't simply that it's long , but the way that it is long . darabont's meticulous attention to relating every event in the novel borders on fetishistic , including encounters ( like the one that permits a reunion between hanks and gump cast-mate gary sinise ) that serve too little narrative purpose . the green mile is never a bore during its three hours ; indeed , it consistently keeps you watching . this just isn't a story that builds to anything compelling enough to warrant such epic length . darabont's adaptation doesn't show enough screenwriting creativity in transferring the story to a cinematic context . too often , it feels like a methodical transcription . darabont does have a way with actors , and that carries the green mile a long way . michael clarke duncan is a shy and sympathetic coffey , his occasional moments of childlike wonder an effective balance against his moments of anguish . and any film with bonnie hunt is doing something right . in the shawshank redemption , the soulfulness of morgan freeman's performance grounded the film whenever darabont got too operatic . that quality is missing from hanks . though his character also isn't as complex as red , his performance at times feels too mannered . i kept imagining david morse -- who plays edgecombe's right-hand man " brutal " howell -- in the lead role , and suspecting the green mile would have been a better film with morse's dramatic presence . watching hanks emoting with a sothern accent just kept reminding me of forrest gump . with edgecombe serving as a less-than-engrossing narrator , it's too easy to notice the aforementioned operatic qualities : tearful goodbyes , battles between good and evil , more exploding light bulbs than i've seen since the natural . there is no denying that the green mile is a well-crafted film , and that coffey becomes an extremely affecting character . it just takes a long time to get there , a long time that could have been shortened in a more efficient screenplay . darabont is a talented director , and a pretty good writer . he's also earned the right to be less slavishly devoted to his source material . while we wait for his next effort -- and i don't think there are any more stephen king prison stories sitting around waiting to be made -- we can only applaud him for taking a unique risk . and we can say , with a tinge of regret , " it's no shawshank .

screenplay : john hamilton and david reckziegel . the subject of the experiment : male attitudes about women , sex and relationships . without the star power , but that wouldn't be entirely fair to this canadian battle-of-the-sexes comedy . true , it covers some familiar territory in the realm of contemporary sexual politics , but it adds enough twists and fresh characters to stay interesting . more to the point , he's someone who thinks he's figured out everyone else but doesn't have the first clue about himself . dinsmore does a fine job with jimmy , combining charm , arrogance , intelligence and uncertainty into a coherent character . the scenes with his male friends rang somewhat false , thanks largely to a performance by burke lawrence that begins and ends as a swaggering caricature . fortunately , these scenes are infrequent and less critical , allowing dinsmore to shine where he's needed most . the larger flaw in myth is an excessively stagy quality , as though it had been intended originally as a play . many scenes , particularly those involving the conversations between jimmy and jane , are a bit claustrophobic , and even the lighting design suggests stage roots . the script often lays it on rather thick , using speeches to get points across with little subtlety , sometimes the same point more than once . but to its credit , the myth of the male orgasm plays fair with both sexes' attitudes , avoiding a " women good , men bad " level of simplicity . both jimmy and jane learn something , and the film's most appealing message may be the need to get past assumptions and generalizations in the formation of honest relationships . the broad , theatrical acting styles and blatant politics may not be for every taste , but i found the myth of the male orgasm to be a clever and occasionally insightful take on the collision of changing roles with centuries-old perceptions . 
screenplay : amy schor & vicki polon . director : anthony minghella . sometimes , it's all about state of mind . either you're ready to enjoy a certain kind of movie , or you're not . i can envision a different set of circumstances under which i might have walked away from mr . wonderful with eyes rolling and a groan of " puh-leez . " but i didn't . instead , i found it to be a warm and charming lightweight romance , full of appealing performances and well-directed moments of tiny heartbreak . nothing about that premise screams originality . feuding exes who still carry a torch have been fodder for most daytime and nighttime soaps for ever . the relative success of mr . wonderful is attributable almost entirely to the cast . dillon is an extremely likable lug ; sciorra has the tense charm of a woman just discovering herself . their scenes together work to perfection because they manage to be thoroughly convincing as two people who have know each other , as lee notes , " practically since i was born . " they shift naturally between civil conversation and petty bickering , creating a genuine sense of history between them , and it's extremely entertaining to watch . it was the frequency of moments like that one which ultimately won me over to caring about these characters . parker has one of the most expressive mouths in films , and she uses it to show more different shades of emotion than she has lines . i also enjoyed david barry gray , who has an endearing puppy-dog energy about him as gus's best friend pope . this is not to say that all of the characters worked all the time . vincent d'onofrio only gets three scenes to develop what ends up being a rather important character , and consequently seems to try a bit too hard to make dominic angelic . and yes , dillon does have some overplayed moments , making gus's " hidden emotions " far too obvious for anyone with half a brain , or even a notochord . director anthony minghella , who gave us the low-key supernatural romance truly , madly , deeply , seems to have a knack for finding slices of real emotion without resorting to schmaltz . i was genuinely touched by a small moment involving a woman waiting for a blind date from a personals ad , as well as a brief conversation between rita and lee . however , these same moments also made me wonder whether mr . wonderful had missed an opportunity to be a more wide-ranging examination of everyone's search for a mr . or mr . wonderful , and what people are willing to do or give up for that chance . as it stands , the focus on the specific still held my attention . mr . wonderful is no work of art , but it's gentle and affirming and it caught me on a good day . kindly check in your cynicism at the door . 
screenplay : john logan and oliver stone . director : oliver stone . in any given sunday , oliver stone may have found the ideal subject for his unique brand of cinematic storytelling . coaches send in the x's and o's , but it's the kinetic fury of what goes on in the huddle and at the line of scrimmage that comes alive . if any given sunday had stayed on the field , focused on the intensity of games , it might have been a classic sports movie . stone , however , has bigger issues on his mind -- as he inevitably , agonizingly always seems to . he wants to do all this despite the fact that he has too much ground to cover to give any of his themes more than a superficial gloss . it's not enough in 1999 to intone breathlessly that pro sports is corrupted and corrupting . you must be prepared to tell a human story that feels human . he's a director who just can't help underlining everything he puts on screen so the themes are tattooed on our foreheads . will be showing ben-hur in the background . when characters are feuding , there are shots of gathering storm clouds . any time any given sunday is focused on the lives of its characters off the field , you keep hoping for an opportunity to discover something real about them . stone , unfortunately , keeps steamrolling forward with split-second edits and changes in film stock , never offering a viewer the chance to contemplate what the story is about . stone's message : it's about exactly what i'm gonna tell you it's about , and i'm gonna tell you over and over and over again . all this is true , yet there are still those masterful game sequences . for stone , the '90s have been all about experimentations in multimedia assault . any given sunday takes a game that feels almost languid in its pacing on television and shows us the cranked-up energy of all the participants . coaches make frantic sideline adjustments , and players look for an opponent's slightest giveaway of his intentions . >from the you-are-there field level camera work to the twists on predictable sports movie heroics , stone plants you inside the game . and that's the only time he shows much interest in getting inside anything . any given sunday is stone's grandiose attempt to make football a metaphor for all of human existence , when he could have settled for a perfectly splendid film about football as a metaphor for football . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
director : alan parker . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , brief nudity , sexual situations ) running time : 145 minutes . i have not read the much-loved memoir by frank mccourt on which angela's ashes is based , but every indication is that the film re-creates mccourt's limerick of the 1930s and 1940s magnificently . it's a life of almost inhuman squalor , compounded by the effects of unemployment and alcoholism . it's the kind of life you might not believe existed if someone hadn't committed his life story to the page . as a snapshot of existence in this particular time and place , alan parker's adaptation of angela's ashes is exemplary . as a compelling story , it's not half as effective . things are not much better there , as malachy is rarely able to find work , and drinks what little money he manages to earn . biographical stories can be tricky to pull off dramatically , since it's easy to portray them as a series of stand-alone episodes rather than part of a thematically consistent story . that's the problem that plagues angela's ashes in parker's attempt to maintain the integrity of mccourt's tales . this is a film composed almost entirely of vignettes : frank's first communion , frank's work on the coal heap , frank's visit with some classmates to see his first naked girls , etc . some of them amuse , and some of them are touching , but few of them resonate the way it seems they should . instead , it plays as just one more vignette in a life of first communion , work on the coal heap and seeing naked girls . the one place angela's ashes does resonate -- if all too briefly -- is in the portrayal of frank's father . carlyle's performance , combining a strange pride and sincere intentions with a pathetic sickness of the soul , is one of the best things about angela's ashes ( emily watson , by comparison , has little to do but smoke and look determined ) . the wrenching moments in which malachy disappoints his family -- particularly when frank tries to balance his disappointment with his love for his father -- give the film its emotional weight . when malachy leaves the narrative , it never quite has as much to say . i can imagine that device giving his experiences more immediacy , something to sustain the story beyond mere sympathy for young frank's plight . as a film , angela's ashes works mostly as a period record , with production designer geoffrey kirkland , costume designer consolata boyle and cinematographer michael seresin working their technical magic on a somber , straightforward script . too much of it is admirable without necessarily being engaging , serving as a mere litany of childhood miseries . without the father/son angle that had served the film so well , angela's ashes drifts into two and a half hours of variations on a grim , grimy theme . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
after the smash romantic thriller ghost and the suspense mystery jacob's ladder , rubin had already staked his claim to status as master of metaphysical melodrama . now comes his feature directorial debut , my life , which again ventures into issues of life and death . the results are extremely mixed . when my life scores , it scores big ; when it misses , it misses big . to his credit , rubin avoids the glycerine-soaked excesses that plagued ghost . this isn't a big-screen version of a " disease of the week " tv-movie ; it's a contemplative , almost spiritual story buoyed by the small but crucial role of the healer played by haing s . ngor . ngor projects a serenity which permeates the film , the effect of his splendid scenes with keaton lingering long after the scenes themself end . in fact , my life may be surprisingly over-subtle when it requires a moment of real catharsis . too much of bob's struggle is kept beneath the surface , and as a result i was left with a truckload of questions about who bob jones really was . by far , the best thing about my life is michael keaton . those who remember his impressive performance in clean and sober know that keaton can be a fine dramatic actor when he has good material , and my life provides him with some fine moments . the best are those which play to his cocky comic sensibility . there is real charm to the scenes of bob's videotaped instructions to his yet-to-be-born son on such vital issues as shaving , basketball and entering a room . when it comes to the more serious elements , keaton doesn't have as much to work with . my life is supposed to be about a change in bob jones' life , but we don't get a clear enough picture of who he was before his illness to make it evident that there has been a change . rubin ignores the basic dramatic rule of " show , don't tell " by having another character say that bob " isn't exactly an example of an examined life . " that's a quality i just don't feel i * saw * . my life also caught me just as i had reached my breaking point in terms of tolerating saintly cinematic wives/girlfriends with no discernible personalities of their own . nicole kidman's gail is a complete blank , spending far too much of the time radiating dangerously high levels of understanding . i was left completely untouched by the crucial love story because i never believed that there were two human beings involved . instead , i saw one human being and one porcelain figurine with lots of hair . kidman's one genuine moment , a very funny line in the middle of gail's labor pains , was shocking because it was the first time gail seemed to be made of flesh . the fact that it's bob's story doesn't mean that gail can't be well-written , and she is not . in spite of my distaste for the love story , i was ready to be far more positive in my recommendation of my life until its final fifteen minutes . after a solid opening , alternately entertaining and introspective , my life just peters out . bruce joel rubin the auteur didn't have enough other people pushing him to flesh out his characters or fill in the holes in an otherwise affecting story . 
screenplay : david howard and robert gordon . mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , violence ) running time : 102 minutes . i can say without reservation that galaxy quest boasts the best mainstream " high concept " of 1999 . i started chuckling the moment i heard about a film in which the cast members of a beloved television science-fiction series -- a decade removed from any career except appearing at conventions and ribbon-cuttings -- were mistaken by an alien race for real fighters for interplanetary justice . i saw it as a wonderful opportunity both to needle the phenomenon of " star trek " fandom and to embrace its fundamental optimism . if handled properly , it could be a fun and funny adventure into the way our popular entertainments can help define our world , and define the performers who create them . i was so engaged by the concept of galaxy quest that , even as the film was unfolding , i kept cutting it slack . it's also something of a missed opportunity ( or , more specifically , a series of missed opportunities ) . screenwriters david howard and robert gordon drop in plenty of goodies for those in the " star trek " know , yet they're often more content to rely on insider gags than to flesh those gags out . a story with the potential to focus on how the actors come to terms with their legacy ultimately becomes just another comic adventure , less about the people than about the premise . oh , but that premise does make for some entertaining viewing . most of the best jokes showcase an internal logic that should be the envy of every science-fiction film : because the thermians designed the real ship after the television ship , it follows all of the show's rules . though the humor does tend towards the " insider , " at least it's insider in a generally clever way , finding amusement even in the captain's tendency to lose his shirt during every fight scene . galaxy quest is far too lively and good-natured to deserve harsh criticism ; in a season full of prestige-hungry oscar wannabes , it's nice to see a film interested primarily in putting a smile on your face . the smiles , unfortunately , don't turn into full-fledged laughs often enough . the situations beg to have the absurdity level turned up just a notch ; the characters beg to be given more personality . " high concept " is most often used by critics as a derogatory term , but that didn't have to be the case for galaxy quest . though it may send you out of the theater chuckling , it could have taken its concept even higher . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
disney has been responsible for plenty of icons of childhood over the past 60 years , but if my son's wardrobe and stuffed animal collection are any indication , no libretto has been kinder to uncle walt's place over the years than the works of a . a . milne . kids adore these characters beyond measure , as befits characters based on a real child's own beloved playthings . the tigger movie is by no stretch of the imagination an embarrassing chapter in disney's relationship with the pooh gang ; indeed , it's light and generally pleasant . it just seems a shame for these characters to be wasted on filler between disney's _real_ animated films . the talent involved in the creation of the tigger movie offered plenty of hope that it could be plenty entertaining . many longtime voice participants in the pooh universe , including original piglet john fiedler , lend their gifts to the story , providing a sense of continuity from earlier stories . even more promising was the participation of veteran disney songwriters richard and robert sherman , the legendary brother tandem behind hummable hits like " the bear necessities , " " everybody wants to be a cat , " " supercalifragilisticexpialidocious " and even the original " the wonderful thing about tiggers . " this was not the sort of interest you'd expect to find in a cheap knock-off . and the tigger movie isn't a cheap knock-off . it just never feels particularly inspired , or particularly true to milne's amiable tales . yet that's the sort of lesson-mongering one would never associate with pooh and company . one also wouldn't expect a story that needed to be spiced up with a climactic avalanche to give it a sense of drama . one certainly wouldn't expect that the shermans' song contributions would be such a lackluster lot , with even the most obvious effort to create a catchy standard -- the pop culture-filled production number " round my family tree " -- falling short . for a disney film , it sure feels a lot more like one of the more half-hearted attempts to mimic a disney film . in all fairness , it should be clear that the tigger movie seemed to delight it's target audience of kindergarteners . there are even some enjoyable moments to delight those of us who are slightly older kids , including the perfectly pitched pessimism of eeyore ( peter cullen ) and tigger's colorful way with a malaprop . it's a cute film in its way , but there are those of us who expect more from disney when some of its most beloved characters are plopped into a new film . the bar is set a little bit higher , because it's too easy to fall back on the audience's good will towards those characters without insuring the vehicle is as tuneful , playful and easy-going as pooh-bear himself . the tigger movie isn't bad . it just doesn't feel particularly deserving of its stars . call me a sentimentalist , but i like to think of pooh as more than just a marketable brand-name . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
i mean no disrespect to the burgeoning bhutanese film industry when i suggest that being selected as the bhutanese representative for the best foreign language film oscar doesn't automatically qualify as an impressive achievement . it's understandable that the cup would warrant some unique attention on this basis . the question is whether anyone would be paying much attention to the cup if it didn't happen to offer a unique cultural perspective . it's always tough to say , but i'm guessing not . there are certainly some charms in this fact-based bit of whimsy , set in 1998 at a tibetan buddhist monastery-in-exile . there's no denying that the cup may be worth seeing simply for its sociology lesson . american films with tibetan buddhist themes -- seven years in tibet and kundun -- have often seemed to be so concerned with telling the story of an important political issue that the personal side has been lost . it is certainly refreshing to see a story in which tibetan people are seen as people , and not merely as martyrs . and then one moves past that humanizing appeal , and doesn't find a whole lot more . writer/director khyentse norbu understands his people , but he has a lot to learn about structuring a narrative . even at only 93 minutes , the cup drags along towards the monks' eventual efforts to gather enough money to rent the television and satellite dish , then try to get the whole apparatus working . it's worth a few chuckles to see the monks trying to navigate the technology ; it's considerably less entertaining watching the film meander , dabbling in the crowd-pleasing qualities of shadow puppets and a sort of " gift of the magi " sub-plot involving orgyen and a younger monk's beloved keepsake . the pacing of the cup may be perfectly representative of the culture from which it originates , just as the story itself may be perfectly representative . i find myself leaning towards a recommendation simply because it showed me something i didn't know before , which is one of the reasons i love film in the first place . there's just not much substance to the cup worth getting enthusiastic over , unless the mere notion of tibetan monks playing pranks and watching soccer is enough of a hilarious incongruity to carry your viewing experience . the amateur cast and rookie director can't make the film soar on its own terms . or about making bhutan's first oscar contender . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
wildly flawed though it may be , wonder boys has one thing going for it you just can't take away : a dead dog . call me a sick puppy if you must -- in a cinematic environment where you can litter a landscape with human corpses but god forbid the plucky pooch doesn't make it to the final reel intact , it's refreshing to find a film with the nerve to off fido . you learn something about a film-maker's willingness to take you somewhere different via these small touches , and they're the kind of small touches wonder boys sends spilling all over the screen . and so on . if there had been something more cohesive at the center of wonder boys , it could have been one of those minor classics of tics and quirks like the freshman . instead , it's a rambling , shambling , often endearing mess of a movie about a pittsburgh english professor named grady tripp ( michael douglas ) . the aforementioned oddball touches probably give you a good sense for wonder boys' unconventional tone , but the film's unconventionality actually goes a bit beyond that . confidential ) and screenwriter steve kloves ( awol from the big screen since flesh and bone in 1993 ) give the story a pacing that can best be described as unhurried . it's almost as though the filmmakers treat everything as though it's seen through the eyes of tripp , whose fondness for the ganja cannot be overstated . douglas , who has never been shy about taking on characters with an unpleasant side , gives a good-natured performance as a guy who becomes ever-more-dilapidated over the course of the film . all those moments in such a leisurely , unpretentious package should have added up to first-class fun , but somehow wonder boys never quite gets there . more to the point , it doesn't leave you with the impression that first-class fun was the object in the first place . suddenly you're left with the sensation that wonder boys was really about a 50-year-old adolescent just learning how to grow up , which leaves you wondering why development of tripp's character was so haphazzard . it's one thing to enjoy a casual story about the exploits of a casual character . it's a bit more frustrating when you realize something serious was supposed to come out of it . it's particularly frustrating when nothing about the first 90 minutes of the film suggests any of the characters were meant to be taken seriously . that's not to say it's not enjoyable to spend time with them ; downey , mcdormand and maguire all craft convincing characters . there's just not enough weight to wonder boys for it to support a moral to the story . it's possible to spend most of wonder boys grinning at its nonchalance , its goofiness and its small pleasures . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay/director : oliver stone . the problem with oliver stone , in my humble opinion , has always been that he just doesn't know when to shut up . i have long been a detractor of stone's , but that opinion hasn't been a result of his visual style ; each of his films can boast at least one moment of real flair . unfortunately , stone's tendency towards the pedantic often obscures those elements of his films which do work . heaven and earth , stone's third foray into the vietnam war , is much the same . every once in a while , when he lets his camera do the talking , you can see the potential for greatness , but the talky , over-narrated script blunts the film's power . conflicts with both the v . c . visually , there are several sequences worthy of an oliver stone highlight reel . cinematographer robert richardson's opening shots of ky la are rich and beautiful , including a particularly striking image of an orange-robed buddhist monk walking through tall green grass . there is an intense sequence involving le ly's torture at the hands of the southern government which had the entire audience gasping and squirming . perhaps most notable is the whimsical portrayal of le ly's first encounters with american consumer culture , including a slow-motion walk to an overstuffed refrigerator and the preparation of a dinner entirely from frozen and canned foods . stone has a keen directorial eye , and heaven and earth is usually interesting to watch . would that stone's ear were so keen . heaven and earth's primary responsibility is to pull the viewer into le ly's suffering , but that never really happened for me . there is very little in the narration which could not have been demonstrated visually , and it acts as a distancing mechanism , providing a retrospective voice which doesn't allow the trials of a teenage girl to seem like they're happening to a teenage girl . it's sloppy screenwriting on stone's part , and all the more disappointing because he's so much better at showing than he is at telling . where we should be focusing on harrowing images , instead we get speeches . newcomer hiep thi le has to carry the two and a half hour film , and essentially she's up to the task . as with most novices , her biggest problems are with scenes requiring big emotions , but those problems are not distracting . le displays le ly's strength and determination admirably , as well as her conviction that karma from a past life is responsible for her current troubles . conchata ferrell is also notable in a scene-stealing turn as le ly's gabby american sister-in-law . butler is only sketchily developed , appearing late in the film and never developing fully enough to make his later actions understandable . still , stone is a fine director of actors , and his cast is basically strong . stone's intention with heaven and earth was clearly to show us that as much as we in america think we suffered as a result of the vietnam war , vietnam suffered more . there are glimpses of that suffering , but it should have been a much easier point to bring across . le ly experiences more suffering than most lifetimes , but it never seemed quite real . elements of heaven and earth carry undeniable impact , but when it was money time he should have descended from his soapbox and let his camera do the talking . 
screenplay : martin sherman . director : waris hussein . in retrospect , my responses to the summer house seem very confusing . i did laugh at this lightweight british comedy ; in fact , i laughed quite a lot . at the same time , i found myself wondering why i wasn't enjoying it more . the summer house is full of quotable one-liners , spirited performances and good intentions . it also never quite adds up to a satisfying film . at just under 80 minutes , the summer house leaves some characters sketched in only the broadest of strokes , and burdens the humor with an unnecessarily dark and cumbersome story structure . the small problem in this scenario : margaret not only doesn't love syl , she doesn't even like him . nearly everything that works in the summer house is thanks to moreau and plowright . moreau is mischievous and full of energy , bordering on over-the-top but just managing to keep the reins on lili . these two fine actresses are extremely entertaining , and the summer house might be considered worth seeing simply for their performances . the characters surrounding them aren't quite so worthy of attention . although ostensibly the centerpiece of the story , margaret is really very poorly defined . david threlfall , who resembles monty python's eric idle while playing one of his unctuous game show host characters , really hasn't got much to do but leer and be slightly off-putting , and his character makes the situation much more ridiculous than it needs to be . even julie walters , a very good actress , is wasted in the role of margaret's mother . there was clearly a great deal of time spent giving these characters funny things to say , but not nearly as much making them real . even more distracting than the absence of real characters is the absence of a coherent plot . the summer house is comprised largely of snippets of witty conversation , funny in their own right but never moving towards anything . the details of margaret's affair are revealed in distracting flashbacks , and the entire issue of the marriage seems sometimes to be in the way of the characters quipping . there are also some disturbing undercurrents--intimations of child abuse , an unexplained violent death--which seem grossly out of place and entirely unnecessary . ultimately , i can give the summer house a mild recommendation because of the laughs it provides , but i was disappointed by the unrealized potential for something a bit more human . 
i don't think any american filmmaker in my lifetime has had his personal life as closely associated with his films as woody allen . the compulsively auto-analytical allen created a classic film persona , but he also created a monster : a body of work constantly being read for clues about its creator . at first , it may sound like another apologia for the artist as world-class clod , a la deconstructing harry , but there's actually something more going on in the character of emmet ray . if he's not the best there is at his art , he may not be able to justify his self-imposed isolation from emotional connection . i'm coming to believe that sean penn may be the most talented american actor alive . penn does so many things right as emmet that it suddenly becomes evident that allen doesn't quite know how to handle it when an actor can make his script seem irrelevant . the light-hearted structure , with jazz scholars commenting talking-head style on emmet's misadventures , becomes jarring and distracting as emmet's story unfolds . episodes like emmet's attempt to con an amateur talent contest or his role in a botched hold-up ( told in three possible variations ) feel like forced attempts at giving the film a woody allen sensibility . only when allen holds penn unexpectedly in the dead center of a reaction shot -- a crucial exchange with another character where you'd usually expect a cutaway -- does it appear the director understands what he has working for him . samantha morton has also received plenty of praise for her role as a mute laundress with whom emmet has a lengthy relationship , and it's certainly an impressive physical performance . it's also clear how much morton is contributing to the story when she leaves the story , only to be replaced as primary romantic interest by the gratingly mannered uma thurman . but this is a jazz odyssey that works thanks to a stunning lead performance of a fascinating character , in spite of a structure always on the verge of sabotaging that character . you might suspect that the notoriously private allen was using sweet and lowdown as a first attempt to really open himself up emotionally on screen , but found it so awkward that he had to keep telling jokes . or maybe he's just an imperfect filmmaker who cast a great actor in an imperfect film . naaaaahhhh . . . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : peter steinfeld . producers : al corley , bart rosenblatt and eugene musso . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 95 minutes . at one point in drowning mona -- one of the strangest , most frustrating films i've ever been able to sort of recommend as a critic -- small-town cop wyatt rash ( danny devito ) conducts an interview after the suspicious death of town witch mona dearly ( bette midler ) . that can't possibly read as funny as it plays , but it's typical of the throwaway gags that kept me chuckling constantly through an utterly pointless plot . through flashbacks we see a variety of antagonizing incidents , many of which may have happened in a completely different way . the goal would seem to be a broad , dark comedy combining devito's twisted sensibilities , midler at her most obnoxious and a well-known everybodydunnit : throw the ruthless people from the orient express . only the broad , dark comedy is far and away the least interesting thing about drowning mona . at its best , it's a showcase for the sort of giddy , utterly unexpected moments ( by screenwriter peter steinfeld ) that can make a devotee of great film writing swoon . and so on . actually , and so on and on and on . steinfeld is clearly a clever fellow , but he also doesn't quite know when to quit , or how to keep the tone jaunty . there are trite scenes involving an alcoholic catholic priest , shoulda-been-but-not-quite gags involving a man's use of the " wheel of fortune " board game as foreplay and a misguided scene apparently intended to make mona a sympathetic loser ( instead of the cackling cartoon better suited to the story ) . by the time the final half hour rolls to a close -- including a forced bit with a lesbian kiss and tracey walter becoming the film's town loony ex machina -- drowning mona has lost a lot of the bounce in its step , tossing out much of the subversive humor for chases and exposition ( and far too much screen time for neve campbell ) . still , there are those great bits of business that make too much of drowning mona too much oddball fun to dismiss completely . plenty of those bits of business would have worked just as well in any other story , which makes it a shame that it had to be a wacky farce . crank drowning mona down a notch or five , yank some of the bigger stars out of the film and make it a sly low-budget film ( which has been director nick gomez's milieu ) , and you might have really had something . you have something anyway , something as smart and weird as it is big and dumb . maybe it's only a certain kind of viewer who will enjoy sitting through the big , dumb stuff to get to big , dumb jeff sarcastically tapping his thumb and forefinger together , taunting bobby by playing " the world's smallest tambourine .

starring : stockard channing , will smith , donald sutherland . screenplay : john guare . director : fred schepisi . there are few greater cinematic challenges than adapting a stage play for the screen . the two media are so different -- one primarily of words , the other of images -- that some plays just don't lend themselves to a film rendering . for every amadeus , a play which was opened up into a grand period drams , there is one a few good men , too talky and stagy to succeed fully . that is the problem i fear many viewers could have with six degrees of separation . thematically , john guare's play is quite rich , as it is in character . however , its rapid-fire dialogue and exaggerated acting will strike those unfamiliar with live theater as too stylized and unrealistic . the characters at the heart of six degrees are marvelously intricate , tying together an examination of the vagaries of fortune . where this theme could have come off as a liberal social manifesto , six degrees treads lightly , making the obsession of the kitteredges and their cronies with finding the man who had duped them comic but clear in its message : their world is threatened if just * anyone * can appear to be one of them . the snag in six degrees is that even with its clever editing , even with its location photography , it still feels far too much like a stage play . don't misunderstand , i love live theater . it is just that acting styles and narrative choices which work when a performance is in real time by actual size human beings one hundred feet away don't work when those same human beings are twenty feet high . will smith's genteel paul poitier persona seems too forced and phony for anyone to accept , even the star-struck kitteredges , and the problem is that he's giving a big , broad performance much better suited to the stage . as a result , although i was intrigued with what six degrees had to say , the staginess of the production didn't allow me to get caught up in it . to be fair , not all of the performances have that quality . donald sutherland does an extremely sharp reading of flanders , never permitting him to appear stupid , which it would have been exceedingly easy to do . his sense of outrage grows as his facade crumbles , and he conveys that tension with subtlety and style . six degrees of separation provides some very funny human comedy in an extremely well-constructed story . it's also a story which works much better on stage . 
screenplay : jack bernstein , tom shadyac & jim carrey . director : tom shadyac . as many individual elements as i might analyze with any given film , my gut reaction almost always comes down to one crucial issue : did the film do what it was trying to do ? if it was a thriller , did it keep me in suspense ? if it was a romance , did i respond emotionally ? and if it was a comedy , did i laugh ? of all the film types , comedy is perhaps the most difficult to analyze ; either it works , or it doesn't . which brings me to this confession : i laughed at ace ventura : pet detective . god help me , i laughed quite a bit . comedian jim carrey's unique persona won me over in spite of a great deal of stupidity and some sluggish pacing . vanity projects are a dime a dozen these days , but they all apply a very similar logic , namely that if you let the star do what he or she does best , and if that star's audience is large enough , you'll have a success . i'm not sure whether the latter condition is true of carrey , but it is true that he's allowed to do what he does best . it has been a long time since i've seen a physical comedian who looks as comfortable on screen as carrey . his elastic features recall early jerry lewis , while his spindly frame and geeky self- confidence show traces of pee-wee herman . when the comedy is purely physical , the laughs are really big . the opening sequence features ace disguised as a parcel deliveryman gleefully shattering the contents of his package to simulate a shipping mishap . ace ventura boasts some of the most amusing slapstick in recent years this side of the zucker-abrahams-zucker films . it's considerably more erratic in its success when it comes to verbal gags . in fact , ace ventura is almost self-congratulatory in its political incorrectness , using homophobia and sexism as punch lines . the film drags between visual set pieces , rescued only by carrey's goofy delivery . part of the problem is that screenwriters carrey , tom shadyac and jack bernstein frequently seem unclear as to when enough is enough . ace's trademark mocking cackle , borrowed from carrey's fire marshall bill character from " in living color , " is funny once but not three times . a more telling example involves the theme song from the crying game , used perfectly once but then used again so that it just seems derivative . finally , one piece of advice for filmmakers : if you must use dan marino for a cameo , please don't give him too many lines . an isotoner glove commercial is about all i can take . there would seem to be little point to commenting on the supporting players in ace ventura , since for all practical purposes they serve as scenery with sag cards . she has a fun , over-the-top part much like her role in fatal instinct , but wisely she avoids trying to steal scenes from carrey . it just wouldn't work . in ace ventura , jim carrey establishes himself as a first-rate screen clown , one i hope to see again . 
keeping the faith is not a feature length version of the old joke about a priest and a rabbi walking into a bar . . . not exactly , anyway . the set-up finds director/co-star edward norton exploiting exactly that concept as his character -- new york catholic priest brian finn -- relates the film's story to an incredulous barkeep . there's a lot of ground to be covered in a romantic comedy that also introduces questions of faith , cultural and religious melting pots and balancing career and personal goals . and keeping the faith seems intent on covering every last square foot of it . screenwriter stuart blumberg dashes madly back and forth between themes , while norton dashes madly back and forth between tones ( how else to describe a sentimental romance that also includes slapstick dips in holy water fonts and the surreal inclusion of " heroes of the torah " trading cards ? ) . oh , and somewhere along the way they're supposed to fit in a love story . it's no wonder norton felt the need to have a lightweight film clock in at two hours plus . thank heaven that keeping the faith is often quite funny in its fragmented , scattershot way . blumberg's script is ripe with good dialogue , and a couple of solidly crafted set pieces ( including a jewish american princess date from hell ) . stiller continues to build a body of comic screen work that measures up to any of his contemporaries , giving zing to jake's self-deprecating manner . there are eye-catching bit parts , including ken leung in a very funny scene as a karaoke machine salesman . and there's jenna elfman , who has never particularly impressed me in the past except as a ball of energy . here she's a completely convincing object of desire ( even if norton lingers on her close-ups a bit too lovingly ) , luminous , intelligent and driven . as one part of a romantic pairing , she's a tough act to match . the match , as it turns out , becomes one of keeping the faith's bigger problems . the premise is sound enough , but stiller never looks comfortable as a romantic lead . in fact , there's more plausible chemistry between elfman and norton , and not just because both actors are blonde -- the pairing we're expected to root for just doesn't seem like a particularly good combination of personalities . how much more interesting -- and daring -- keeping the faith might have been if the film had suggested anna was merely sublimating her desire for brian with jake , making for much tougher choices at the film's conclusion . that's probably too much to ask from a film that , at its core , is a fairly fluffy hollywood confection . it's certainly a pleasant enough diversion , good for more than enough chuckles to make it worth a look , but it's surprisingly timid for a film that tries to cover so many thematic elements . it's also a lot warmer 'n' fuzzier than you'd expect from the cinematic equivalent of " a priest and a rabbi walk into a bar . . .

screenplay : paul mayersberg . director : mike hodges . mpaa rating : unrated ( could be r for sexual situations , nudity , profanity , adult themes and violence ) running time : 91 minutes . good noir-ish thrillers are so few and far between that it almost breaks my heart when one with so much going for it stumbles so badly down the stretch . from the outset , croupier looks like it has all the classic film noir elements . owen's laconic performance as jack is perfectly pitched ; he's got that campbell scott deadpan thing going , which is particularly appropriate since he's a dead ringer for scott . and paul mayersberg's script offers a potent combination of sly dialogue , effective characterizations and intriguing introduction to the world of the croupier . only it doesn't . it's hard to imagine a more anti-climactic climax to a thriller than the one offered up by croupier . it suddenly becomes evident that mayersberg is going to wrap things up far too quickly to make the film's conclusion satisfying . a manipulative plot is exposed , but jack doesn't seem particularly concerned by it . a character appears to confess a secret love that makes you wonder what film you just wandered into . a film like croupier absolutely demands a big payoff -- either realization that the protagonist has been suckered into being the victim , or a big smile as he ends up the victor . croupier can't manage to provide either one . it's almost as though mayersberg got stuck on the film he was writing and pasted on the end of another film entirely . it's a testimony to how well croupier works for 90% of its running time that the train wreck of a conclusion can't derail the whole film . there are some memorable scenes -- jack's expert manipulation of a poker game , for instance -- and some provocatively enigmatic holes in jack's back-story . there are also so many missed opportunities that you just want to shake mayersberg for his sloppiness . i'd also recommend leaving the theater at that point . any ending you can come up with in your head is better than the one that ended up on the screen . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : sofia coppola , based on the novel by jeffrey eugenides . director : sofia coppola . all right , admit it : the credits " written and directed by sofia coppola " don't exactly set the heart racing in anticipation of artistic triumph . your defining image of sofia coppola probably involves her single-handedly making the godfather part iii painful to watch . or maybe you go back farther , to her script credit on the lifeless " life with zoe " segment of new york stories . if so , then consider this ( perhaps faint ) praise for the virgin suicides : sofia shows more visual flair in her directorial debut than papa francis has managed to show in the last 20 years or so . if only she had managed a bit more story sense . stylistically , coppola does plenty to keep the film interesting . there are few gimmicks she's unwilling to employ : slow-motion , split screens , odd angles . she also crafts one extremely effective sequence at a homecoming dance that captures every nuance of adolescent romantic fumbling . her approach shows coppola understands that the virgin suicides is not a simple narrative , but a flashback remembrance of pubescent fantasy . the girls are representations of idealized visions by the story's collective male narrator ( given voice by giovanni ribisi ) , not fully-realized characters -- and that's fine . sounds good on paper , doesn't it ? it's true that coppola gives the virgin suicides just the right atmosphere , but she never manages to latch onto anything that would give the story focus or momentum . her biggest mistake is making arbitrary use of the novel's structure as a remembrance told from a distance of many years , much of it through imperfectly recalled interviews with key players . it's a great scene -- effectively demonstrating the lasting effect the lisbon girls had on those around them -- but it also serves to show how much better the film would have been with more moments like it . the tale's young male observers also disappear for long stretches , allowing the film to drift into trite suburban family drama . on the page , the virgin suicides was hypnotic and mysterious ; on the screen , it's a collection of eye-catching individual moments that too rarely coalesce into something more profound . in a cinematic climate where films about adolescents usually bear little resemblance to reality , it's refreshing to find a film-maker interested in capturing the tangled emotions of that time . sofia coppola is working from a fundamentally strong source , and she has put together a cast and crew that make the virgin suicides worth watching ( and worth listening to , with its sublimely kitschy soundtrack of period tunes by elo , styx and heart ) . when it latches on to those moments of wonder at the emerging adulthood of the opposite sex -- one boy's wide-eyed discovery of feminine hygiene products in the lisbon bathroom , for instance -- it's dead on target . unfortunately , there's also too much of the mundane in coppola's adaptation . if she develops as much instinct for storytelling as she does for directing , sofia coppola could be a film-maker to watch for . and there's a prospect i'll bet you never expected . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : gina prince-bythewood . director : gina prince-bythewood . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 120 minutes . love for the game of basketball -- and for women's basketball in particular -- fills virtually every frame of gina price-bythewood's love and basketball . she even does something i never expected to see in a sports film , something that sent this hoops purist into a rapture : she has her heroine win a big game not by taking the last shot , but by taking an offensive foul . she knows them well enough that it makes up for the sluggish narrative to which she attaches them . there's a nice scene in which the two 11-year-olds go from first kiss to knock-down brawl in the space of a few seconds , neatly summarizing the competitiveness that will sabotage their mutual attraction . it takes a special performance to lend credibility to wild swings of emotion . lathan nails every twist in monica's life journey . in theory , the film follows the careers of both quincy and monica equally , but it's always evident where price-bythewood's heart is . quincy's character is far less interesting from the outset , since he's already a high school star . nearly every time quincy or his family are drawn into the story , there's a palpable loss of energy , a more predictable arc to the drama . making it a story with two equal protagonists repeatedly makes it evident that price-bythewood doesn't understand quincy nearly as well as she understands monica . by the time the film draws to a close after two hours , you may feel as though it has gone into at least one overtime . gina price-bythewood builds a sense of the epic into the relationship between quincy and monica , but there's always the sense that it would have been much more effective as a smaller , more intimate story . it's a very good film when it focuses on one woman's attempt to create a happy personal life that also includes the game she loves ; it's pretty mediocre when it tries ineffectively to give equal time to the men . it may be my long-standing affinity for women's basketball talking , but i wanted a film about the one character in which the filmmaker clearly had the most emotional investment . women finally have a basketball league of their own ; it shouldn't have been too much to ask to give them a basketball movie of their own . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
now that we have dispensed with the obvious , can we ponder for a moment the mystery of why she continues to pull down roles in films with edge and attitude , since she appears to have little of either ? and in austin powers : the spy who shagged me , even competence eluded her . i can only guess that graham gives killer auditions . on screen , she melts into the art direction whenever she's not serving the function of well , you get the picture . lisa krueger's committed is a goofy , quirky sort-of romantic comedy that offers some pleasant character-based amusement . the fact that it's not more is only partly graham's fault . krueger may even have intended the film as a commentary on the way society looks at people with passionate commitments . there's something intriguing about the way it is assumed someone who will fight to the end for a marriage must be a bit nuts , just as it is assumed fervent believers in anything must be a bit nuts . actually , committed only teases with subtext , since it's not much of a commentary on anything . that doesn't mean it's not entertaining in a sporadic , out-of-left-field sort of way . whenever committed seems to have been lurching along far too long in search of a good scene , it finds one that delivers unexpected laughs ( patricia velasquez as an utterly indifferent restaurant waitress ; alfonso arau in a too-rare screen appearance as a kindly mexican medicine man ) . neil's full-aura massage of joline is one of the sexiest screen scenes ever in which no one lays a body part on anyone else . i wish it all felt like it added up to more , but there's a huge hole at the center of committed . unfortunately , she appears to spend all her acting energy on the work of yanking joline from the jaws of caricature . committed is one of those films in which the things going on around the main character end up far more interesting than anything happening to the main character herself . perhaps that's the way krueger wrote it , retreating to the same isn't-this-all-terribly-indie mannerisms that shackled krueger's previous effort manny & lo . or perhaps everything around joline just seems more interesting because graham doesn't have the presence to command the narrative's focus . i kept wanting to see more edge in joline's connubial stalking , and realizing there was no way i'd ever get it . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : toby emmerich . producers : bill carraro & toby emmerich and hawk koch & gregory hoblit . director : gregory hoblit . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , violence , profanity ) running time : 118 minutes . just when i thought i'd seen every possible spin on the serial killer thriller , here comes frequency to show that there is something new under the sun . time-travel tales are inevitably head-scratching affairs if you ponder them for too long , and frequency is no exception . it's an utterly preposterous conceit , of course , but it actually works . caviezel never once smirks at the material , resulting in a performance full of convincingly pent-up emotion . director gregory hoblit's staging of john's new montage of memory is surprisingly affecting ; caviezel's work as a man re-discovering his father is better than you have any reason to expect in a genre film . now , did i mention that this all turns into a serial killer thriller at some point ? hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich might have chosen to explore the ramifications of continuing to mess with history , but that would be a bit too philosophically deep . frequency is a genuinely snappy piece of film-making , far and away the liveliest work from hoblit ( who got bogged down in the grim subject matter of primal fear and fallen ) , even when you're inspired to a round of " yeah , right . " there's no question that much of frequency is smart and entertaining , but it's also a fragmented piece of work . for the first half of the film , it's a fantasy with a strong human side , anchored by an unconventional but convincing father-son relationship . in the second hour , it shifts dramatically to a creep-show , with the sinister killer popping up at terribly inconvenient times . that makes for some crowd-pleasing chases and struggles , but a terribly rote plot progression . though there are still some well-crafted scenes -- andre braugher gets a particularly good one as a cop friend of frank's watching a world series prediction come true -- character ceases to matter for all practical purposes . the strange thing is that it probably wouldn't have felt nearly as overwrought if frequency had stuck with the tone of its first half . the shift from character piece to thriller is jarring enough ; the attempt to shift back to character piece feels like an unearned piece of manipulation . it's easy to recommend frequency for the things it does right in each of its incarnations , but the recommendation can't be too enthusiastic when those incarnations are so incongruous . i think there's a reason we've never seen this sort of serial killer thriller before : it's awfully hard to make a serial killer thriller a tear-jerker as well . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
producers : conchita airoldi , julie taymor and jody patton . director : julie taymor . mpaa rating : r ( violence , sexual situations , nudity , adult themes ) running time : 162 minutes . i'm not saying that there's absolutely nothing julie taymor isn't willing to try in her feature film debut titus , but at some point during the production i'm fairly certain i saw a kitchen sink fly through the frame . it came somewhere between the roman soldiers marching in traditional costume and political rivals riding in motorcades , between the swing band playing at an emperor's wedding feast and the swing of a camera around a freeze-frame tableau of death a la the matrix . there's no telling from one minute to the next where or when we are , or what cinematic device will make a cameo appearance . virtually from the first frame , titus unfolds as over two and a half hours of blood , bombast and auteurial audacity . i'm having a hard time putting my finger on exactly why titus actually left me marginally impressed instead of bored by the director's " hey , check out what i can do " style . sure , it's shakespeare ; it's also the play t . s . eliot called " one of the stupidest and most uninspired plays ever written . " big mistake . without a sense that there's some sort of cultural lesson to be taken away from the gruesome events , they simply become gruesome events . i'd never read titus andronicus nor seen any production before this one , and i can't say i'm terribly eager to see it again . yet while titus is far from a gripping story , it's still a pretty decent piece of theater . taymor's roots are on broadway ( she directed the stage production of the lion king ) , but that doesn't mean she can't make use of a camera . at times , titus almost seems to be the work of a director who isn't sure if she'll ever get the chance to make a film again , so she leaves everything she's got on the screen . it's hard to imagine so grim a tale given more energy through sheer force of a director's imagination . it would be a cruel misuse of the word " entertaining " to say that titus qualifies . it's well-acted enough -- cumming in particular is a delight as the foppish saturninus -- but not a showcase for master thespianism . in fact , anthony hopkins' best moment may be a ghoulish reference to his renown as cinema's most famous cannibal . i didn't enjoy all that much of titus , but i found myself admiring taymor's choices even when i didn't understand them , or even agree with them . simply put , titus is a display of film-making nerve -- the spectacle of a novice movie director deciding to pick shakespeare for her first work , and one of shakespeare's least respected works at that , then molding it into something consistently watchable . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : joel coen , ethan coen & sam raimi . director : joel coen . the coen brothers are : a ) a pair of intellectual dilettante/pop cannibals whose films lack any kind of soul . b ) a pair of brilliant visual stylists who manipulate genre into something completely original . your choice will probably tell you all you need to know about how you would react to the hudsucker proxy . coen brothers fans will revel in their delightfully off-center perspective and their twisted sense of humor ; their detractors will grouse over their cold mechanics and inaccessibility . and both sides will be correct . fortunately , there is more that dazzles than there is that distracts . that buffoon is norville barnes . however , norville has at least one trick up his sleeve . many of those off-putting elements which have limited the coens' appeal are still in place . director joel is given to wild , manic set pieces and near constant camera movement , which often seem to yell , " look at me , i'm a director ! " fans of vintage cinema note that their spins on established genres read like film school projects : make a " film noir , " make a gangster film . the hudsucker proxy clearly owes most of its inspiration to frank capra's meet john doe , with nods to sturges and hawks along the way . at a certain point , however , homage gives way to parody ; jennifer jason leigh's clipped katherine hepburn/barbara stanwyck delivery is cute for a while but eventually becomes annoying , while paul newman simply seems cartoonish as the snarling , cigar-chomping wheeler dealer . but perhaps most disappointing is the character of norville , whom the coens and co-scripter sam raimi didn't seem to have any interest in making interesting . there's almost a mockery of capra's everyman heroes , who were simple but always imbued with common sense . consequently , it's hard to care about anything except what is on the surface . of course , there is plenty more going on on the surface of a coen brothers film than any dozen other films put together . dennis gassner's production design is part gotham city , part brazil , but stunningly evocative in its own right , while carter burwell provides a fantastic and diverse score . however , it is with two magnificent visual pieces that hudsucker makes its mark . there are dozens of individually memorable moments , lines and scenes , which makes it all the more frustrating that they aren't supported by a memorable story . with triumphant films like miller's crossing and barton fink , the coens have established themselves as among the most original filmmakers of their generation . still , it has only been on rare occasions that they have appeared as concerned with creating characters as they have with framing shots . the hudsucker proxy is worth seeing for its quirky invention , but it's hard not to wish that so much talent could come with a little more heart . 
in a way , it has been a sad thing watching woody allen grow as an artist . i recall watching allen as bumbling would-be thief virgil starkwell in take the money and run as a youth every time it appeared on local television ; i remember the raucous laughter inspired by peeks at the naughtier everything you always wanted to know about sex and sleeper . in my heart i longed for allen to return to arrested adolescence in something besides his romantic life , to a brand of comedy even solid films like manhattan murder mystery and bullets over broadway didn't provide . in my heart , i longed for allen to become virgil starkwell once again . i suppose i couldn't have asked for more convincing proof than small time crooks that virgil starkwell is , in fact , dead . the abrupt shift in plot from caper comedy to fish-out-of-water comedy takes some adjusting , but it neither makes the film nor ruins it . as with most of allen's comedies of the last decade , there are just enough lively gags to remind you why it's still worth looking forward to his films , and just enough dead spots to remind you that he's just not the same . no shift in allen's sensibility has been more damaging to his sense of humor than the ever-increasing level of condescension in his films . there's one delightful moment in small time crooks that nearly re-captures that vibe -- allen trying to slip away unobtrusively at a posh party -- but more often the joke is on someone else . while elaine may is amusing as frenchie's brain-dead cousin , she's also a walking punch line for ray's sense of superiority . when the film gradually becomes a lesson in being careful what you wish for in case you actually get it , it's ray's world of simple pleasures that's held up as the ideal . i'd still rather watch any one of allen's last dozen films ( celebrity notably excepted ) than the majority of what turns up on the local multiplex screen . unfortunately , you keep getting the sense that he knows it , that he's grown so enamored of his ability to impress that he forgets what an incredible gift he has simply to make us laugh . there's a sequence in small time crooks in which the film's characters are interviewed by " 60 minutes' " steve kroft for a newsmagazine story . there's some funny stuff in that sequence , but it kept reminding me of the documentary style of take the money and run . in small time crooks , it's almost as though allen is trying to appease those aliens from stardust memories who cracked wise about enjoying his " early , funny " films . yet even when he's turning out a passably entertaining comedy , it's clear he just doesn't have any virgil starkwell left in him . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
mpaa rating : unrated running time : 45 minutes . these were basketball fans -- how could they not appreciate a tale of the greatest basketball player yet to walk the earth ? it is testimony to the astonishing appeal of michael jordan that even those partisans who should despise him still can't help admiring him . he is the sort of larger-than-life figure it seems was born for a big screen documentary -- and in a very limited sense , that's true . the early moments of the film touch on pieces that added to his mystique . there's the pounding theme of the alan parsons project's " mammagamma " that made chicago bull player introductions a spectacle unto itself . and there's a montage of jordan's legacy of ridiculous , physics-defying shots . he's such an unearthly presence in the film that i began to believe he could change history -- even though i knew chicago had lost one of the playoff games featured , i was still surprised that the last-second shot jordan took to win the game didn't actually go in . if all one was looking for from michael jordan to the max was a sense of his legend writ two stories high , i suppose you could say it was an unqualified success . but there's such an emphasis on jordan's inhuman will to win that his humanity isn't often in evidence . sure , there are scenes of jordan fooling around with kids at a basketball camp , and an effective sequence capturing the ever-present crush of fans that made his every movement a running of the gauntlet . there's just not much sense of what makes jordan tick . even when the player himself speaks , it's primarily in the well-rehearsed platitudes of a professional athlete : " i never doubted myself ; " " you have to pursue your dream ; " etc . it's a shock when we see jordan getting misty-eyed while discussing his relationship with his father , because it's such an unusually unguarded moment . it may be unreasonable to expect a piercingly insightful documentary in this particular format . imax presentations have carved out visions of the awe-inspiring as their unique dominion , and jordan certainly fits that description . instead of taking viewers into the center of real-time basketball games -- in effect , allowing them to be on the court with the legend -- kempf and stern use slow-motion for most of their game shots . they don't even bother to maintain chronology within individual games ( one disadvantage of the big screen is that you can see the scoreboard in virtually every shot , making it obvious when the film has jumped back a quarter or two just for the sake of a cool image ) . michael jordan to the max is all about its star power , the kind that even appeals to a theater full of jazz fans who would wish for a different kind of changed history . as a big-screen experience , it's all about keeping a hero larger than life . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
starring : denis leary , judy davis , kevin spacey . screenplay : richard lagravenese and marie weiss . good scripts are so rare in hollywood that it should be a felony when one gets wasted . sometimes it's dreadful miscasting ; sometimes it's a director without an ounce of vision . the dilemma in which i find myself in such cases is how to temper my response to the things the film failed to do with acknowledgment of its strengths . last year's true romance was one of those films , and the ref is another . there are a lot of laughs in the ref , more than most recent comedies have provided , yet i found it consistently and infuriatingly falling short of the comic plateau it might have achieved in more skilled directorial hands . the script for the ref , by richard lagravenese ( the fisher king ) and marie weiss , is full of comic and dramatic potential , only some of which ever makes it to the screen . comic denis leary gets the lead billing in his first starring role , but it is the sparring of spacey and davis which carries the film . their acid-filled tirades in the film's first half hour are extremely funny , and the two characters are surprisingly well-rounded . but the ref never makes the leap to the outrageous . leary and his director ted demme , who collaborated on a series of promo spots for mtv a couple of years ago which popularized leary's ranting , chain-smoking stand-up persona , seem too concerned here with separating leary from that persona . consequently , he plays a number of scenes far too low-key , and in fact fades into the background almost completely in the last half hour . a number of early verbal confrontations are exceptionally well-written , as all three of the principal characters make their case , and it is to the credit of lagravenese and weiss that at various times all three appear to be completely right and completely wrong . insults fly , and leary merely stands around looking exasperated . there are too many funny things going on in the ref for it to be a complete failure . i found the town's ill-prepared police force and its disgusted chief to be a hilarious subplot , and their handling of a piece of videotaped evidence is a winner . spacey and davis exchange some of the most caustic dialogue since the war of the roses , a style i always enjoy . 
screenplay : david koepp and steven koepp . director : ron howard . after establishing himself with gentle mass-market fantasies and taking a break for an overstuffed comedy , this man got the bug to be taken seriously as a director ; the results tended to be as notable for their excesses as their successes . sound like i'm describing steven spielberg ? not surprising . ron howard's career as a director has often seemed too consciously patterned after spielberg's ( although there are clearly worse models ) , and has represented much that is best and worst about his much more successful colleague's work . the paper is one of these films . it's a bit too busy and precocious for its own good , but still has enough of a charming throwback quality that i was willing to forgive many of its flaws . the paper is delivered with an energy that matches the barely controlled chaos of the newsroom , and that energy is nearly enough to sell the film all by itself . the go-go pacing echoes newspaper films of past decades , the same films the current the hudsucker proxy parodies . indeed , while there is a decidedly 90's spin to the proceedings ( no film of the 40's would ask if its hero were spending too little time with his wife ) , the paper still features such standbys as the gruff editor , the wet-behind-the-ears reporter ( here a photographer ) , and an ethical dilemma . there is nothing daringly original about the way the paper serves up these elements , but the setting itself is so lively and the cast generally so engaging that the lack of originality doesn't assault you . keaton , in his third collaboration with howard , delivers a solid protagonist even though the role demands little of his considerable talents . less successful are close and duvall , but that certainly isn't the fault of the two talented actors . as a result , it seems like we're getting snippets from an entirely different movie . bernie's story is just filling up minutes . it's too bad , because a resolution connected to bernie's family troubles would have been much more effective than the one we get . that resolution includes a bar scene which suffers from extremely sloppy editing leading into not one but two medical crises . it seems like a ron howard film isn't complete without someone dying or nearly dying , as though he doesn't trust any conclusion not based on the biggest possible emotion . what had been a taut , energetic film about priorities and the thrill of reporting bogs down seriously in the final fifteen minutes . it's not quite enough to sabotage the paper's strengths completely , but it does show once again that ron howard the " serious director " too often equates serious with saccharine . 
supervising director : hendel butoy . mpaa rating : g running time : 74 minutes . even today , 20 years after i first saw the original fantasia and 60 years after its premiere , i'm still not sure whether the entire concept is audaciously praiseworthy or pretentiously misguided . on the one hand , it could be seen as a sincere effort to bring kids to the castor oil of the classics , with a little eye candy as sweetener . more cynically , it could be seen as an attempt to persuade parents to take kids to a cartoon because it's really " good for them " -sort of like extolling pizza as nutritionally sound because it includes all four food groups . yet another possibility is that it's an intriguing case study in individual interpretation of an artistic work -- with all the peaks and valleys that concept entails . there's the sense that fantasia/2000's creative team felt obliged to maintain a balance between the experimental and the whimsical , when the experimental pieces are the ones that leave the strongest impression . most dazzling of all is butoy's computer-animated " pines of rome , " in which the image of whales soaring into the sky almost returns the literal meaning to the word " breathtaking ; " that moment alone made me wish i'd had the chance to experience the film in its imax incarnation from earlier this year . it's a wondrous piece of work that creates its own world , a feat the " firebird suite " segment comes close to matching ( though there's more than a little princess mononoke to the imagery ) . there is also an undeniable energy to the " rhapsody in blue " segment , directed by eric goldberg ( aladdin ) with a clockwork story sense and an obvious affection for the artists who inspired both the look and the sound . when fantasia/2000 really lets its creative talent loose to explore the unfamiliar , the results are impressive . with " pomp , " there's the greater problem of the music's undeniable connection to a specific context : graduation ceremonies . in fact , there's something just a bit off about all of the segments connected to instantly recognizable music-the grandiose abstractions of beethoven's fifth , the duck tales-goes-genesis " pomp , " even the generally satisfying " rhapsody in blue . " it may have been part of the fantasia plan to say , " look , here's another way to look at a piece of music you may have pigeonholed previously , " but it doesn't always work . a magical mickey defined " the sorcerer's apprentice " in the first fantasia ; an antediluvian donald just makes you wonder why all these animals are graduating from the ark . admittedly , a couple of them are good for laughs ( steve martin and penn & teller , to be specific ) . the rest are an overly reverential bore . it's a curious decision , because if there's one thing the rest of fantasia/200 is not , it's reverential . even when it flounders , it usually flounders because an experiment fails , not because someone was unwilling to experiment . and that's the faint damnation with which i ultimately praise the film : it doesn't always work , but even when it doesn't work , it's in ways that make it obvious someone was still trying . this fantasia inclines me to the perspective that it should be seen as a showcase for pure inspiration , a way to see how fine art can in turn inspire more fine art . this version is an uneven realization of that vision . i'll still be looking forward to fantasia/2060 . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay/director : andrew fleming . i think " the wonder years " may be to blame . there was a time when i didn't take particular notice of voiceover narration one way or the other ; it was just another part of a movie . now i'm not sure whether it is the content of the narration or my perception that has changed , but it seems lately that hearing narration at the beggining of a film is enough to make me suspicious . there comes with some narration a pretentiousness that can weigh down a simple story or pummel an audience over the head with a moral . threesome has all the elements to be a successful lighthearted character romp , but many of its strengths are obscured by the moments it takes itself far too seriously . threesome is set up almost as a three-character stage play wherein other characters exist only to make observations on the behavior of the three principal characters , and those characters are established with widely varying degrees of success . stuart is probably the most interesting and fully-rounded character , one who bears many of the marks of a stereotypical college jerk but responds to his roommate's sexual orientation with minimal sturm und drang . stephen baldwin is surprisingly charming in the role , spewing forth sexual single-entendre with an infectious enthusiasm . still , there comes a point where his heaviness is a bit much for an audience to take . alex is part sex kitten , part basket case , and several other parts of several other characters , and it's difficult for anyone to strike the right tone with such a character . what did work strike a chord with me was the interaction between the three characters , which was extremely reminiscent of relationships i knew . the dialogue , while tending toward the unrealistic , is still frequently funny , and i found myself basically engaged in the lives of these three people as long as they weren't navel-gazing about how hard it all was . and it is on the level of its self-consciousness that threesome falls somewhat flat . what could have been a lively and fairly entertaining look at a slightly different kind of romantic triangle instead becomes a film that tries far too hard to be * about * something . the narration , which comes retrospectively from eddy , is filled with descriptions that could just as easily have been provided visually , and with pseudo-profound pronouncements about that wrong turn that becomes the best part of a trip . there are a couple of three-way love scenes which are handled deftly , but much of andrew fleming's direction is leaden . it appears as though he wasn't quite clear that he had a decent little comedy on his hands ; it wasn't really necessary to try to turn it into an earth-shaking drama . 
screenplay : iain softley , stephen ward & michael thomas . director : iain softley . from the phrasing of that question , it would appear that at least one change from the original lineup of the beatles is assumed to be part of the popular consciousness . it is an intriguing and atmospheric study of a complicated romantic triangle , but it lacks solid performances across the board to back up ian hart's dynamic work as john lennon . although of whom is not entirely clear . director and co-writer iain softley has a unique perspective from which to tell the story of the beatles' rise from ragged cover band to international icons , so backbeat never becomes simply an " early years " bio-pic . it does boast some clever music numbers which highlight the band's frustration with their seedy environs , and an exciting sense of place . this theme is highlighted in one of the film's best sequences , when stu plays hooky from a recording session to spend the day with astrid , as softley cross-cuts between the ever rowdier session and stu's idyllic encounter . still , backbeat could have been much , much stronger with some better acting in two of the three lead performances . it's certainly not the fault of ian hart , who has cornered the market on playing a homoeroticized lennon after this film and 1991's the hours and times . whereas in most films a line like , " we're going to be too big for our own bloody good " would come off as silly historical revisionism , it seems plausible coming from hart's cynical visionary . his brilliance is emphasized , unfortunately , by the blandness of co-stars stephen dorff and sheryl lee . dorff's stu is always a bit too low-key , even when he's doing his painting , so as a dramatic character he never becomes all that interesting . she doesn't inject enough life into her performance to make it clear why everyone seems so fascinated by her . and sadly , americans dorff and lee are both saddled with uncomfortable accents . backbeat needs to feed off the conflict in this central triangle , but there's not enough spark to their interaction , and the film often plays like the commitments on quaaludes . as long as the music is playing , backbeat is quite good . if only more of that energy could have carried off stage . 
screenplay : peter greenaway . producers : kees kasander . director : peter greenaway . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , sexual situations , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 120 minutes . in 8-1/2 women , peter greenaway makes a film , and several completely nude men and women appear . . . but i repeat myself . greenaway's sensibilities have never shied away from provocative issues or images , specifically where the human body is concerned . yes indeed , peter greenaway loves putting naked people on the screen . in 8-1/2 women , lead actor john standing's genitalia get so much screen time , they probably should have gotten third billing in the credits . the question with greenaway has always been whether there is much to his exercises in conspicuous kink besides the conspicuous kink itself . by the time 8-1/2 women winds to its conclusion , it's hard to imagine a sexual fetish or taboo that's been left unexplored or undiscussed . there's even the ghastly sight of amanda plummer in neck brace and the kind of garish make-up usually associated with the emcee in cabaret . don't mistake this , however , for a film designed to arouse anything but curiosity . the episodes appear and disappear as though the whole enterprise were simply a fashion show for perversity , with scarcely a hint of eroticism to get in the way . as flesh-baring free-for-alls go , this one is pretty flaccid stuff . in a way , however , that absence of sexual intensity is what the film is all about . in a reflexive gag based on a reflexive film , greenaway has his two main characters comment on fellini's 8-1/2 , with philip wondering " how many film-makers . . . make films simply to act out their sexual fantasies , " to which storey replies , " all of them , i suppose . " in his typically skewed fashion , greenaway has made an intentionally un-titillating cautionary tale . if only greenaway's films felt as much like stories of real people as they felt like lessons . there's no question that greenaway is a superb film stylist ; he crafts powerful compositions like the interchanging medium- and close-range shot of the father and son conversing by the indoor pool , ripples reflecting off the walls . his films too often lack real emotional resonance , however , and 8-1/2 women is no exception . there are isolated moments when philip's grief seems more central to the story than the director's aesthetics , and there's a surprisingly funny scene in which one female servant discusses her failed " try-out " for the harem with a co-worker . more often , 8-1/2 women is another case of greenaway giving his audience lots to look at , a bit less to think about and virtually nothing to feel . he's a maker of intriguing but only fitfully satisfying films that happen to include lots of penises and breasts . he may be cinema's foremost purveyor of art-core porn . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " .

director : jenniphr goodman . yes , it's another independent film about hyperarticulate-yet- underemployed guys in need of a lot of growing up . first dates beware : this may get you into deeper discussion than you'd like . the result is a love story that's as smart and entertaining as it is utterly predictable and instantly forgettable . that humbling occurs during a climax that takes contrived to a new level , a genuinely clumsly conclusion to an otherwise generally satisfying story . it's testimony to the effectiveness of the tao of steve's punch lines -- instantly quote-worthy though they're not -- that the film overcomes its erratic pacing and limp climax . and it probably helps to be an alum of the school of hyperarticulate-yet- underemployed guys to appreciate the minor charms of a film that's equally comfortable tossing off references to kierkegaard and " the bugaloos .

screenplay : ken kaufman and howard klausner . producers : andrew lazar and clint eastwood . director : clint eastwood . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 130 minutes . space cowboys will be greeted with enthusiasm in a certain demographic group simply because it dares to suggest that americans over the age of 60 exist . that's a fairly revolutionary notion in pop culture , most of which is targeted at an audience that still gets graded in " nap-time " and " scissors . " it's also a rare opportunity for veteran actors to get work in major roles , so you can't blame anyone involved for being enthusiastic about the project , especially given its themes . it's fun to watch a film like space cowboys -- and probably even more fun for those viewers in the stars' peer group -- because the film itself could be an example of what its protagonists are trying to demonstrate : sometimes , wisdom and experience trump washboard abs . clint eastwood has been around the block a few times in hollywood , so you'd think that his experience would teach him the difference between a good idea and a good script . there's more than a little bit of grumpy old astronauts to space cowboys , with screenwriters ken kaufman and howard klausner taking advantage of time-worn senior citizen incongruities . it's cheap humor , but it's still amusing because the performers seem dignified even when they're doing silly things , and because everyone seems to be having so much fun doing it . in any other outer space adventure , the hour-plus wait for the astronauts to get off the ground would be excruciating . it's bad enough that once the daedalus mission is underway , the good humor and cameraderie of the training center sequences vanishes , leaving nothing but crisis resolution-based plotting . worse still is the mission itself , a ridiculous " surprise " that would have been evident even if eastwood hadn't filmed certain characters with ominous slow-zoom close-ups to signal their soon-to-be-revealed villainy . eastwood doesn't even seem interested in the entire third act , racing through the events at such a frantic pace ( particularly for the usually meandering director ) that you may wonder if he was running out of film . more likely , he understands that once the entertaining interplay between the actors gives way to shaky-cam explosions , there's not much reason to wait before sprinting toward the credits . space cowboys builds up enough good will through its first 80 minutes to carry it over the massive hump of its lame conclusion . eastwood is still one of the most uniquely evocative visual film-makers around -- a director generally willing to linger where other directors would cut -- which generally makes his films worth experiencing . his style also makes him a uniquely appropriate choice for a film about characters that have reached the point in life where they'd rather amble than run . space cowboys ambles right along with eastwood , jones , sutherland and garner , right up to the point where they amble into the conclusion of a generic summer action film . this kind of veteran acting talent deserves better . wisdom and experience should tell someone like clint eastwood that there's plenty of kids' stuff out there without trying to make him and his co-stars part of it . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : andrew w . marlowe . director : paul verhoeven . mpaa rating : r ( violence , gore , profanity , nudity , adult themes ) running time : 114 minutes . hollow man follows in the fine tradition of james whale's 1933 version of the invisible man , in which claude rains loses his mind and goes on a murderous rampage . we understand this instinctively to be realistic because it's in the dna of every heterosexual adolescent male to define invisibility as the power to walk into the girls' locker room with impunity . hell yes we'd engage in a little mischief if no one could see us ; even the best of us might find it hard to resist the temptation . power corrupts , and so on and so forth . hollow man could have been a provocative examination of what that temptation would do to one of the best of us . the invisibility serum works on caine , but the reversal serum is not so successful , stranding caine in his invisible state . a bunch of techno-babble sets up the notion that the subjects of caine's serum are " out of phase with the visible universe " blah blah blah , and disappear from the outside in , one layer at a time . in fact , hollow man is awash in nifty visual tricks cleverly implemented : the thermal view of a full frontal bacon ; a scene of caine vomiting up invisible food in silent answer to that age-old question ; bacon's ghostly visage appearing in water , smoke and a tossed bag of blood . as effects-heavy thrillers go , this one at least makes every moment of technological gee-whizzery genuinely worth a gee-whiz . what it lacks , in essence , is anything that can be called a story . there's a vacant spot in the center of the film even before caine vanishes , because there's nothing remotely sympathetic about him from the outset . while we can still see him , he's an obnoxious sort who makes off-color jokes and mocks the vivisection of his lab animals . there's no character arc to sebastian caine ; hollow man merely presents the fairly self-evident answer to the question , " what would happen if you granted omnipotence to a cruel , self-absorbed bastard with a god complex ? " the script doesn't even give a character arc to its ostensible protagonist , shue's dr . mckay . perhaps she too could have been tempted , or learned something about scientific hubris . ultimately , it's nothing but a technically proficient mad slasher movie . make that a fairly diverting , technically proficient mad slasher movie , at least during its high-energy third act . the film turns from a gloss on cronenberg's the fly to a gloss on both alien and aliens ( though i actually enjoyed the nod to westworld , with josh brolin following in papa james' footsteps in a cat-and-mouse game involving thermal perception ) . the final 20 minutes becomes a frantic and generally entertaining hack-n-slash through the supporting cast members , leading up to an appropriately ridiculous climax . it's too bad verhoeven and screenwriter andrew w . marlowe weren't interested in putting some meat on hollow man's bones . even with all its visceral appeal , it could have been so much more interesting to watch the story of the guy who wants to walk into the girls' locker room with impunity , instead of the guy who wants to walk into the girls' locker room and blow it up . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : ronald bass and al franken . director : luis mandoki . this is the contradiction of when a man loves a woman : as impressed as i was with most of its parts , i kept coming up with better ways to piece them together . it's that rare film that pulls very few punches in its examination of a family in crisis , but there is a schizophrenia in the perspective . there are some extremely effective performances , but director luis mandoki shows us far too much from the perspective of the alcoholic character . but that might be even harder than it first appears , as the lack of social lubricant exposes cracks in michael and alice's relationship , and the time comes for hard decisions . he doesn't respect alice , and a couple of great scenes demonstrate how he treats her like one of his children . ryan is solid as the fragile and frightened alice , and plays a very restrained drunk . she also makes a believable transition after her detox , leading into a fine bit of acting in a counseling session . the big showdown between michael and alice is completely raw and very compelling , and garcia and ryan have tremendous chemistry . i felt this was essentially the story of the family's response to and discovery of the extent of alice's problem , and not the story of alice and her recovery . consequently , i wasn't bothered by the slickness of the production , because it fit with michael's lack of awareness of what was going on beneath the surface . but then mandoki and screenwriters ronald bass and al franken seem to want it both ways , showing us alice sneaking into the street for a drink , or in the middle of a case of the dt's . a focus on michael would have mad this a very different film from most films about substance abuse , but when a man loves a woman retreats into the obvious . it was moments like her last scene with garcia which finally brought me to tears , and convinced me that there should have been more family moments . the original title of when a man loves a woman was significant other , but it really should have been significant others . 
director : richard donner . one might expect from that list that maverick is a good-looking , good- sounding , good-natured production , and it is . and little more . maverick is pleasant , but it never really takes off , opting to replace a solid narrative with a series of sketches of widely varying quality . gibson plays bret maverick , a roguish gambler much better at playing cards than he is at playing hero . some of these moments are quite entertaining , particularly an encounter with a group of indians with whom maverick enjoys a special rapport . gibson and foster are also quite good together , generating a lot of smiles simply from the spark of their interaction . gibson in particular is perfectly cast as maverick , a sly but ultimately big- hearted fellow with a gift for avoiding danger . there is enough charm and energy in his performance to carry maverick over many of its rough spots . it's a shame that maverick misfires nearly as often as it hits . it's a peculiar mixture of missed opportunities , overkill and necessary but unfortunate editing decisions ( which whittled this once two and a half hour film to a still over-long 2 : 05 ) . when he produces a $100 bill and asks for change , you expect a slick con , but again maverick doesn't quite follow through . once the actor is unmasked , the joke should be over , but it's milked for more than it's worth in a way that made me think , " all right , i get the joke . " maverick is full of these fits and starts , making it hard for me to like it as much as i wanted to . maverick concludes with a number of plot turns reminiscent of the sting , and didn't necessarily find them predictable , i didn't really find them all that interesting , either . by the time it hits the final fifteen minutes , maverick finds itself in serious danger of overstaying its welcome , ending with far less energy than it begins . still , maverick is what summer movies are generally meant to be : big , light entertainment . as frequently as it pulled its comedic punches , maverick still had enough dopey fun to be worth a matinee look . but if the inevitable sequel rolls around , i hope gibson , donner and company learn their lesson and start with a script from which they don't need to cut so much . 
how whimsical and amusing does a film need to be before it ceases to matter that it lacks a center -- not just that its center is slight , but that it has no center whatsoever ? such a question plagued me at the end of saving grace , a comedy with that uniquely british quirky appeal . it was a pleasant enough experience for most of its running time , but what in the world was the point ? there are certain kinds of comedies that can get away with a complete lack of an identifiably human character arc . this doesn't seem like it should be one of them . how does one reconcile 90 minutes of grins with the nagging impression that the script was in some ways terribly sloppy ? perhaps the best course of action is simply to roll with it . from the outset , saving grace seems to have nearly every element in place for a wonderfully entertaining piece of middle-brow humor . blethyn anchors the film with a performance that's more restrained than recent outings like little voice , effectively playing incongruous moments like her attempts to sell her product on the streets of london while dressed like the queen mum . perhaps most refreshing , there's an unapologetic quality to the film's just-say-yes story line . it's all quite a bit of silly fun for those with no moral objections , until saving grace winds to its conclusion and it becomes evident that there's something missing -- namely , a third act . but saving grace doesn't bother with developing its characters . grace doesn't appear to grow or learn much of anything , and matthew's change of heart is tacked on almost as an afterthought . there's no sense of consequence anchoring anything that goes on in saving grace , like the unemployed full monty crew's search for a renewed sense of their manhood . it all begins to seem like little more than an excuse on which to hang a bunch of jokes about giggle fits . it would feel like a complete violation of grace's character , if not for the fact that grace's character isn't developed carefully enough for there to be that much violation . such carelessness should be enough to sink a frothy enterprise like saving grace , but somehow it doesn't quite . too many of the quirks work , and too many of the giggle fits inspire similar reactions from the audience . it's no masterwork of comic craftsmanship , but it does the job of taking you somewhere goofy and free of responsibility even though you know it's not particularly good for you . and maybe that's a fitting quality for a film about unapologetic pot smokers . ninety minutes of grins sounds about right . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : billy crystal and lowell ganz & babaloo mandel . director : paul weiland . it's a hard life being a sequel . it must be something like being the younger sibling of someone incredibly successful : the self-imposed pressure to deal with the mystique of the predecessor ; inevitable and unforgiving comparisons ; some level or another of disappointment . we , as viewers and critics alike , have tremendous difficulty separating the roman numeral from the name that precedes it , even when the sequel might be a perfectly decent film in its own right . city slickers was a lively , funny film with a dose of warm fuzziness ; city slickers 2 : the legend of curly's gold is less lively , less funny and a bit more heavy-handed in its emotion . for all that , it's still got more laughs than any other comedy out right now , and a dose of high-spirited action besides . one is that avarice isn't nearly as endearing a motivation as self-discovery . there is a lack of depth to much of the humor as a result , and even the fraternal conflict between mitch and glen can't pick up the slack . he indulges billy crystal's worst tendencies toward hamming it up with borscht belt shtick , and daniel stern goes bug-eyed at the slightest provocation . there was an irony and a light touch to ron underwood's direction of the original , a touch weiland doesn't seem to have . however , city slickers 2 is consciously a very different kind of film than its predecessor . it's a big , broad , silly adventure and on that level it succeeds . jack palance is again a delightful presence , amd makes duke a bit nastier yet also more accessible than the crusty curly . no one plays a sadsack quite like lovitz , who outshines his co-stars with his oddball inferiority complex and impromptu renderings of soliloquies from the godfather films . the action sequences , while a bit too familiar , are still well-staged , and the script by crystal and city slickers veterans lowell ganz and babaloo mandel is full of funny lines . they may not always add up to a huge payoff , but they keep coming and there aren't many duds . city slickers 2 centers its character growth on the value of friends and family , but most of the time the emotion seems forced . ganz and mandel seem to require a saccharine center to their comedic confections , and the result is an even greater likelihood of an unfavorable comparison to city slickers . had crystal insisted on a pure romp , he might have scored big . as it stands , city slickers 2 : the legend of curly's gold is a sunny , funny comedy at least as worthwhile as comedy/western competitor maverick . . . and right now , that might be the more valuable comparison . 
screenplay : jim herzfeld and john hamburg . producers : nance tenenbaum , jay roach , jane rosenthal and robert deniro . director : jay roach . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , drug references ) running time : 105 minutes . it just strikes me as an absurdity of the highest order to pump up jay roach for his powers oeuvre . they were mike myers films , plain and simple , and pretending otherwise is like giving tom shadyac credit for the success of ace ventura , or dennis dugan for big daddy . to his credit , roach knew enough to mostly get out of myers' way , showing he understands how to take advantage of a gifted comic performer's strengths . let's not forget , however , that this is also the director of mystery , alaska -- not exactly the second coming of preston sturges . in meet the parents , roach gets to oversee yet another gifted comic performer , and once again the film is primarily effective to the extent that it gets out of that performer's way . there's more of an undercurrent of hostility to stiller's on-screen persona , but he still makes has an uncanny ability to make his characters' frustrations and awkward situations hilarious . meet the parents gives stiller plenty of opportunities to squirm -- notably when he concocts an impromptu recollection about milking the family cat -- and his discomfort is almost always good for a laugh . if you're a ben stiller fan , you'll probably be a meet the parents fan . unfortunately , stiller does have to struggle against an inconsistent script and flaccid direction . though meet the parents is at least subtle enough to avoid make greg's antagonist an out-and-out villain , it's still primarily a film of broad individual gags . the situations grow more elaborate , and the set pieces more convoluted , but there's no natural build-up to the comedy . roach's direction misses the right rhythm both for individual scenes ( notably the domino effect after greg unwittingly lets the byrnes' cat out of the house ) and for the film as a whole . there's never any sense that meet the parents is building to a humorous crescendo so much as it is doling out punch lines and pratfalls at regular intervals . every possible situation comes to the expected worst-case scenario for greg , and the characters come to the expected epiphanies at the expected times . that the film works in spite of the people behind the camera says a lot for the people in front of the camera . the supporting players support effectively ; owen wilson , even underused as he is here , still adds an off-beat edge to every scene he's in . meet the parents is one of those films where most of the laughs come from waiting for the protagonist's next humiliation , and often such films are as nerve-wracking as they are amusing . stiller is simply so funny when he's sweating -- and so determined not to be a victim even as he's being victimized -- that the amusement manages to emerge triumphant . it's a shame that he's working with a workmanlike director who cuts off scenes before they've reached their zenith , but it's often the fate of brilliant comics that they can't find brilliant directors to work with . even when the performers' gifts manage to emerge , the reverse is rarely true . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
i can't imagine a thoughtful movie lover watching one without realizing that director tony barbieri -- a first-time filmmaker -- is in complete command of visual storytelling . he does things veteran directors by the score would shun out of simple fear , though they are likely the best choices for the moment . he embraces a distinctive rhythm , and lets his camera say things his characters can't say . this is neither a flash-for-flash's-sake technical show-off , nor a man content to point his lens at people while they exchange glib dialogue . one is a coming-out party for a director to watch . i'd love to report that barbieri's eye and his narrative restraint make one a must-see film , but it's possible to take narrative restraint to an extreme . the first thing anyone is likely to notice about one is that it doesn't look or move like a typical film . barbieri tells the story of these lingering characters in lingering takes , with performances pitched at a level of quiet resignation . his preferred composition places his camera outside a doorway , with only one of the two characters involved in the scene visible at any time . it's a device he uses perhaps to excess , but he captures effectively the tension between people occupying the same room while living in different worlds . barbieri even makes the subtly audacious choice in one scene to slowly blur the characters in a scene , pulling the focus to an object in the foreground so gradually you may just think your eyes are playing tricks on you . at virtually every moment , i was fascinated by the prospect of what barbieri might do next . the narrative itself , unfortunately , is not nearly so fascinating . it's not that the characters are not compelling ; barbieri and cairns have crafted a pair of enigmatic , lived-in roles in charlie and nick . one simply suffers from a near-crippling case of " the muteds . " virtually every emotion and every confrontation isn't just writ small , it's writ to the point that you need a microscope to see it . barbieri may have been aiming for a style that feels real , but he seems scared to death of anything that could be perceived as an emotional high point . he observes and observes and observes -- skillfully , to be sure , but from such a distance that the characters threaten to disappear at any moment . in his zeal to make one feel real , barbieri doesn't allow it to feel at all . even with such a mega-subdued story , one is still strangely watchable . the naturalistic performances are good ; the arc of the two main characters consistently interesting . but it's really about barbieri's knack for using his camera to create a mood . there are many skills that make up a great director : facility with actors , pacing , and yes , setting up the right shot for the right moment . i can't wait for the film he makes when he masters the other two . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : ryan rowe & ed solomon and john august . producers : drew barrymore , nancy juvonen and leonard goldberg . director : mcg . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , violence , adult humor ) running time : 92 minutes . charlie's angels is the sort of marvelously out-of-control hollywood contraption that can turn any critic into joe bob briggs . drew barrymore's cleavage . big-ass explosions . more of drew barrymore's cleavage . tom green extended cameo . and one pygmy nuthatch . by any reasonable filmmaking standard , charlie's angels is a mess , a bizarre attempt to mix '70s cheesecake with '00s computer-enhanced james bond-ian action . it's infuriating not to be able to shred it to ribbons for being the geek-boy wet dream it clearly was meant to be , but there's just too much wild amusement here to dismiss . in fact , their mission is to induce endocrine overload in viewers who can't get enough of hot chicks doing spinning kicks through the air while wearing curve-hugging clothing . there's no point getting too cerebral about charlie's angels . in fact , if you do decide to see it , it would be wise to check under your seat as you leave to make sure your mind hasn't leaked out of your ear into a puddle on the floor . sure , there are the requisite self-aware nudges to show that it knows not to be taken seriously -- a reference to t . j . hooker : the movie , a gag about overwrought action film acting , etc . -- but it still keeps up a frantic pace so you won't notice how awkwardly made it is . certain action sequences are chopped short , character-building sub-plots stall the film in place and the tone shifts abruptly from moment to moment . whatever 21st century spin the folks involved might want to put on this version of charlie's angels , it's still all about the t&a -- whether it stands for technique & attitude , or bears the cruder , more common meaning . but damned if it still isn't more fun than mission : impossible 2 , or the world is not enough , or virtually any other recent high-tech caper you'd care to name . part of it is how unabashedly over-the-top it all is , from the physics-defying fight sequences to the megaton explosions . part of it is the way the comic relief actually provides comedy , including bill murrays' inimitable bill murray-ness and cameron diaz getting into her ditzy side . part of it is the strange appeal of watching a film that lets women be the james bonds ( including the unapologetic casual sex ) , and comes up with better villains than the bond series has had for some time ( dig that crispin glover ! ) . and yes , a whole lot of it is how it pulls off the neat trick of sending up the series' hair-flipping jiggle appeal while still taking advantage of it . do all the pieces of charlie's angels add up to slick movie-making ? no . in fact , rookie feature film director mcg clearly has a lot to learn about elements beyond slow-motion and near-subliminal edits . he does , however , have a game cast , a competent script , some awesome fight choreography and a willingness to turn anything into a joke . this ain't art , but it ain't the kind of tediously predictable big-budget garbage you usually find at your multiplex , either . this is movie-making heavy on the drew barrymore-hangin'-out-a-window-while-nekkid-fu . scott says check it out . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
starring : zbigniew zamachowski , julie delpy , janusz gajos . screenplay : krzysztof kieslowski and krzysztof piesiewicz . it is understandable that he announced his retirement from filmmaking at this year's cannes film festival where red , the third segment of his three colors trilogy , premiered ; three films in two years is enough to burn anyone out . still , it is a shame to see such a versatile director leave the scene . last year's blue was a marvelous psychological drama ; white is an acidic little comedy . white is also somewhat less satisfying than blue , well-acted and directed but suffering from basic deficiencies in motivation and characterization . zbigniew zamachowski gives a delightful physical performance as the rumpled but sympathetic karol , appearing perpetually bewildered and on the verge of tears . however , he is less successful at conveying karol's transformation into a slick go-getter . like many events in white , the change occurs too quickly , and it seems to be presented as an article of faith that this is something that was always within karol , just requiring the right setting--at least i didn't see it on the screen . even more perplexing is dominique , whose feelings for karol are believably convoluted but who turns into a bizarre creation by the film's conclusion . there is a surreal quality to the events of white's last fifteen minutes , a quality which sabotages any sense of character . the sequence which theoretically explains this change ( featuring an effective use of an all-white screen as an accent ) doesn't , at least not as believably as it should . julie delpy , like zamachowski , nails her character in the beginning of the film , but drifts into something unrecognizable by the final scene . it's unfortunate that the characters are so unfocused , because kieslowski's exploration of equality is intriguingly multi-faceted . most obviously , there is karol's attempt to " get even " with dominique , an attempt with unexpectedly successful results . white is full of interesting ideas , more than ten average films put together , but they're just not executed all that smoothly . moments of brilliance shine out in white ; others are dulled by chaotic characterizations . 
screenplay : cormac wibberley & marianne wibberley . producers : mike medavoy , arnold schwarzenegger and jon davison . director : roger spottiswoode . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , profanity , adult themes , brief nudity ) running time : 124 minutes . it's been more than a little bit sad watching arnold schwarzenegger turn into an object of fond nostalgic reminiscence . nobody's kidding anybody here -- the big guy has always been an iconic presence first , last and always . back in the '80s and early '90s , however , that presence was put to effective use in guilty action pleasures ( commando , predator ) and genuine action pleasures ( the terminator films , total recall ) . what does he have to show for most of the last decade ? the last action hero , batman & robin , jingle all the way and end of days . there's no point going overboard with praise for the 6th day , a solid action thriller and little more . it is , however , a pleasure to watch schwarzenegger in action without cringing in embarrassment . surprisingly , it does so in a manner that's both moderately intelligent and fairly clever . the script by cormac and marianne wibberley has fun with near-future developments like life-size genetically-engineered dolls ( with creepy , chuckie-like features ) , cloned versions of deceased pets ( the wonderfully named repet ) and virtual girlfriends , while still addressing the legitimate issues involved in human cloning . the pseudo-science that advances the plot is far from consistent -- the cloned assassins somehow remember their deaths even though their memories hadn't been " backed up " to that point -- but it rarely proves intrusive enough to sabotage the whole package . one of the reasons it's easier to enjoy that package is that it's so simple to unwrap . too many action films ignore the genre's basic rules for success : create a likeable enough protagonist ; give him worth adversaries ; pump up the energy for the set pieces ; and don't over-think things . there's nothing spectacular about any of the action sequences in the 6th day , but spectacle isn't the real selling point here . roger spottiswoode is a competent enough action director who finds just the right pacing for his key moments . he does tend to over-direct the expository segments , reducing even the most basic domestic moments to snippets of film , and proves overly fond of jittery , distorted point-of-view shots for characters' memories . fortunately , he finds the right pace when it counts , and avoids action overkill . the result is a film that keeps moving without feeling as though it's dragging you along or assaulting your senses . it's also simply enjoyable seeing schwarzenegger return to form . he has always shown a great sense of humor about his screen image ( beyond the trademark quips , even ) , and he gets a few opportunities here to indulge his lighter side . in fact , there's a refreshing quality of " just enough " to most of the film . there's a pointless explosion here or a bit too much exposition there , but from start to finish it's generally concerned with delivering the goods . it's faint praise , but praise nonetheless . and after nearly a decade , it's worth a nod of encouragement that arnold schwarzenegger finally doesn't look like a lost action hero . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
starring : guinevere turner , v . s . brodie , t . wendy mcmillan , anastasia sharp , migdalia melendez . screenplay : rose troche & guinevere turner . the problem with nearly every mainstream film dealing with lesbians is that they have been just so * serious * . if you believed what you saw on the screen , you'd think that every lesbian relationship involved a " fallen " heterosexual grappling in anguish with her sexual identity . even at their best , such " love-that-dare-not-speak-its-name " melodramas painted a picture that just didn't gibe the reality i have seen . what a breath of fresh air go fish is : a low-budget romantic comedy finally showing lesbians having fun and leading day-to-day lives . though uneven and amateurish enough to be occasionally distracting , go fish is mostly a frisky and funny pleasure , playing like a sort of when sally met sally . . . . go fish was a labor of love and a financial nightmare for turner and co-scripter/director rose troche , so it may seem unfair to criticize the erratic film quality and choppy editing . however , many of the rookie mistakes troche makes are difficult to pass off on economics . between scenes , she often inserts self-consciously artsy snippets of flashing lights , folded hands and spinning tops , and they just aren't in synch with the otherwise light-hearted film . it was as though troche wasn't sure she was ever going to get a chance to make a movie again , and thus threw every idea she had into this one , resulting in a somewhat scattered final product . troche is also at the mercy of her mostly non-professional cast , and they in turn are at the mercy of some occasionally very sketchy characters . the best role belongs to turner , an appealing presence with self-effacing humor . she delivers shome sharp lines with a wry wit , and anchors the scenes in which she , evy , daria and daria's amour-du-jour comment on max and ely's relationship . not so fortunate is v . s . brodie , who stumbles her way through a part written more through other characters observations than through anything ely says or does . while i have no problem with the idea that max might see past ely's unconventional looks , i would expect there to be a more interesting personality for her to find there . as underdeveloped as some of the characters might be , they still have plenty of funny things to say . in the film's opening scene , kia leads a class in speculating on what historical figures , celebrities , and even fictional characters might have been lesbians . the " talking heads " scenes are particularly entertaining , chief among them a discussion of preferred terms for the female genitalia . and in the film's sweetest and funniest moment , ely practically skips home after a particularly good evening with max . yet as amusing as go fish is , it is not without some frank observations on what it means to be a lesbian in the 1990's . go fish is not without its bumps and flaws , but it is both funny enough and insightful enough to warrant casting a line into its deep waters .

's novel is a dazzling multi-media assault , a tale of degradation and shattered lives that will make you feel as though you need a brain enema to cleanse your memory of its most disturbing images . aronofsky's singularly inventive visual style , combined with one of the year's most chillingly evocative scores by clint mansell and the kronos quartet , dares you not to look away , lest you miss something potentially extraordinary . requiem for a dream is arresting , compelling and frequently flat-out horrifying . so why isn't it one of the best films of the year , if not _the_ best film ? because for all of aronofsky's stylistic prowess , and all the film's visceral power , this narrative falls into an all-too-common trap : it spells out too much of the subtext , and doesn't trust the viewer to get the point without a good-old fashioned bludgeoning . aronofsky eschews the typical fetishistic shots of injections , substituting rapid-fire montages to represent the characters' respective fixes . there are brilliant moments both when the film is at its most kinetic ( sara's speed-fuelled cleaning jags ) and at its most serene ( harry and marion sharing a tender split-screen moment in which their physical connection is disturbingly disjointed ) . there's style to spare in requiem for a dream , but there's not as much substance as there should be , and what substance there is becomes too blatant in its presentation . similarly , a subtle moment in which sara is given a preferred seat among the women outside her building -- just because she may be on television in the near future -- is underlined by sara's comment on her royal treatment . every time requiem for a dream is on the verge of being about more than its characters' inevitable spiral into agony , it quickly offers the cliff's notes version and moves you along to the next moment of personal hell . and eventually , all those moments of personal hell become wearying . as splendidly acted as requiem for a dream is -- and every one of the four principals is very good , particularly burstyn -- it's ultimately a film that pays far more attention to the things drugs does to these people than what it takes away from them . it becomes such a relentless parade of dignity-destroying acts and physical disintegration that the broadly sketched characterizations vanish in the wake of their misery . it conditions you to feel repulsed by what drugs do to these people without allowing you to feel for them as people . this is spectacularly staged and marvelously performed " just say no " melodrama -- reefer madness for the art house set . it's impossible not to get requiem for a dream's message , and nearly impossible not to applaud the messenger . but after 102 minutes , it feels like you've been strapped into a chair while the message imbeds itself into your pried-open eyeballs . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
producers : taylor hackford and charles mulvehill . director : taylor hackford . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 134 minutes . be prepared to be sorely disappointed if you go to proof of life expecting to see the " sparks a-flyin' between meg and russell show . " as has been well-reported by entertainment news outlets , co-stars meg ryan and russell crowe got a little thing going while filming proof of life . it's the kind of story that provides publicity a studio just can't buy , with voyeuristic viewers potentially taking the opportunity to watch a filmed record of two attractive stars developing a major league case of the hots for one another . as it happens , the relationship between ryan and crowe's characters is the worst reason to see proof of life . in fact , the filmmakers seem to do everything possible to make that relationship utterly inconsequential . there are two major co-conspirators in the failure of proof of life's romantic angle : the timidity of director taylor hackford , and the casting of meg ryan . the script by tony gilroy does a fine job of setting up cracks in the bowman's marriage , the kind that could easily lead to some straying during a pressure-packed situation . ryan , meanwhile , never develops into a complete character , with a back story that's made up of script assertions rather than performance . in a role like this , opposite a dynamic screen actor like crowe , it becomes obvious that meg ryan is a movie star in a role that demands an actor . while proof of life's major selling point sits there limply in the center of the film , there's plenty of great stuff going on around the perimeter . morse , a superb character actor who seems only to be getting better with age , gets some wonderful scenes as he tries to cope with his situation . there's more great material surrounding the details of terry's profession , including his friendship with a colleague played by david caruso ( in a performance so vivid it just makes you want to cry over his career choices ) . and there's crowe himself , whose charisma boosts the intensity of every scene he's in . as a film about the psychological pressures of retrieving a hostage , proof of life scores . it may seem unfair to drag the actors' personal lives into an evaluation of a film , but it's obvious from what's not on the screen that the film itself was ultimately compromised by those personal lives . it doesn't . the genuine shame is that it's such a strong piece of work in virtually every other respect that it's still worth watching . proof of life will be a more enjoyable experience for you if you go in expecting a thriller rather than an incendiary screen romance -- especially when the filmmakers keep trying to blow out the flames . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
at various points during disney's the emperor's new groove , it becomes apparent that it could have been a mediocre-at-best piece of animated film-making . here there's a significant lack of detail in the background animation ; over there , a gaping hole where a catchy tune might have buoyed the proceedings ; throughout , a narrative that doesn't exactly set the world on fire . yes , it's all pretty tepid stuff -- and then a character will open his mouth , and set you to giggling uncontrolably . after years of watching its animated features soar on various permutations of stunning visuals , engaging story-telling and memorable songs , disney has finally made a film that succeeds almost exclusively on the strength of its vocal performances . and it does so by a fairly narrow margin . bonding and learning of important lessons ensues . in a way , the whole business is quite beneath disney . much of the emperor's new groove feels cobbled together as an afterthought , as though the real a-team mouseke-thinkers were too busy making fantasia 2000 or figuring out how to promote 102 dalmatians . while the character animation is effective , virtually everything else is about as eye-catching as your typical hanna-barbera background . the progression of the story is bland , with only a couple of really good action set pieces to liven things up . not exactly the stuff of which disney animated " classics " are made , at least until the voice actors get to strut their stuff . david spade provides the perfect petulant , all-about-me vibe for kuzco , though it certainly helps to be in tune with spade's typical caustic sense of humor . as the villainous yzma , eartha kitt growls her role with such delicious malevolence it boggles the mind that she has never been cast as a disney animated villain before . but the real show-stopper is warburton's kronk , one of those essentially decent lunkhead sidekicks who eventually do their evil bosses more harm than good . the part is a familiar one , but warburton delivers his lines with such a combination of deadpan idiocy and absolute sincerity that nearly every syllable out of kronk's mouth is hilarious . screenwriter david reynolds provides some clever dialogue , but it's not nearly as good as the people who bring it to life . the one weak link in the cast is goodman , though it's not really his fault . pacha is as personality-impaired a character as disney has created in a long time for a central role ( okay , probably since pocahontas ) . he's not exactly the hero , not exactly the comic relief -- he's just the big , good-natured guy necessary to move the plot along . considering the relative blandness of the plot itself , there are all kinds of reasons to suspect that the emperor's new groove should have been a dud . congratulations to spade , kitt and warburton -- and to the casting director -- for giving the film the spark the rest of the creative team couldn't quite manage . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : josh goldsmith & cathy yuspa . director : nancy meyers . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( sexual situations , adult themes , profanity , drug use ) running time : 126 minutes . over twenty years into a ridiculously successful film career , mel gibson chose 2000 to do a pure comedy for the first time and it seems terribly unfair that he appears so good at it . gibson has always had tremendous charm on screen , and his light touch provided most of the best moments in the lethal weapon series , but he has shied away from roles that showcased those elements of his personality . mel gibson delivers a wonderfully entertaining comic performance in what women want , the kind of performance that should make for classic comedy . we'll forgive gibson on grounds of inexperience for not choosing the sort of script that could show off his newfound comic chops . what women want , a film that could have been groundhog day brilliant , comes out merely adequate thanks to a script that's about two re-writes away from being ready . then a twist of fate -- and an electric shock -- endows nick with the ability to hear women's thoughts . what women want is a gimmick movie , which can easily turn into an empty marketing-friendly concept without some competent execution . in mel gibson , they have a more than competent star to execute that gimmick . mel knocks out every twist of character and goofy situation he's handed , from the swagger of the opening scenes to his broader physical gags to his quiet moments with hunt . it's not jaw-dropping film acting by any means , but it's so deft with the fluffy material that you'd think he'd been doing it all his life . i wish the same could be said of the writers . at over two hours , what women want is a textbook example of a film with no sense of its story's essential elements . there's hardly a scene in what women want that doesn't feel like it should either be a minute shorter or absent altogether . instead of making all the necessary plot and character points efficiently the first time , screenwriters josh goldsmith and cathy yuspa opt to make the same point multiple times , just so we don't miss it . there are definitely some worthwhile individual moments to make up for the sloppy structure . others are combinations of script and performance , like gibson's drunken experimentation with a number of women's products . and many of them are purely showcases for the actors -- including hunt , who tames her patrician chilliness and delivers her most engaging big screen comic performance . this is really a star vehicle , though , and if it provides any enjoyment , it's from the pleasure of watching a macho man have so much fun doing something he's never done before . give credit to director nancy meyers for finding this performance in mel gibson . give credit to mel gibson for finding this performance in himself . and next time , let's hope we can give him credit for picking better material . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
director : philip kaufman . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , sexual situations , adult themes , profanity , violence ) running time : 123 minutes . as the title character in the people vs . larry flynt , woody harrelson says at one point ( and i paraphrase ) , " if the first amendment protects a scumbag like me , then it will protect anybody . " that's the approximate thematic gist playwright doug wright is going for in quills : an exploration of the idea that even free speech at its most extreme and offensive should still be free . it's a worthy enough idea to espouse , and the movie based on wright's quills should have been plenty worthy as well -- if only it weren't so damned self-congratulatory about its position . as splendidly staged as philip kaufman's cinematic version of quills may be , it's ultimately stunted by a text so concerned with making its artistic points that it flops as simple story-telling . but the not-so-good doctor finds that silencing de sade will be no easy matter , as the prolific nobleman is practically compelled to spill his obscene thoughts onto paper . the marquis , we are told , has been so tainted by the world around him that he must spill " the toxins in his head " into his stories ; madeleine , who revels in his naughty work , tells coulmier , " if i wasn't such a bad woman on the page , i'll hazard i couldn't be such a good woman in life . " quills offers a dozen different defenses of free speech at its most unfettered , including commentary that we must know vice in order to appreciate virtue , and a taunt from the marquis to the abbe : " are your convictions so fragile that they cannot stand in opposition to mine ? " every five minutes or so , there's another re-phrasing of the same point in a slightly different way : art is just art , words are just words , and even the most ghastly art and the most ghastly words must be given their table in the marketplace of ideas . a debatable point , to be certain , but the problem isn't so much whether or not one concurs with wright's absolutist interpretation of freedom of speech . the problem with quills is that wright is so intent on hammering his point home that he ignores little matters like fleshing out his characters . winslet and phoenix are effective as the essentially good people aware of their darker impulses , but wright is mostly interested in them as representations of the dark impulses in all of us . and rush , while thoroughly entertaining as the ultimate libertine , never gets at what de sade was ultimately all about as a human being . once you've figured out what wright is saying in quills -- and it doesn't take all that long -- the playing out of the narrative feels like a long walk around in circles . wright does deserve credit for not taking the easiest ways out with his arguments . he shows de sade's work provoking a group of madmen to violent acts , and he doesn't soft-pedal the cruel , petulant de sade himself as a torture artist just to make him more sympathetic as a tortured artist . there are several individually enjoyable scenes in quills , from the " telephone game " rendering of one of de sade's tales to the staging of a bawdy play intended to humiliate royer-collard . physically , it's a lovely production to behold . emotionally , it is provocative stuff . but intellectually , it's redundant . it's clear that wright believes even the kind of art that could inspire a columbine massacre must not be suppressed . it's equally clear that he feels pretty good about himself for saying so . ironically , quills probably works best as simple , sensual , prurient-interest entertainment . as a presentation of ideas , it's more thesis than theater . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : akiva goldsman and robert getchell . director : joel schumacher . the film adaptation of john grisham's the client is in a unique position . artistically , on the other hand , the expectations are probably much lower , again based on the previous grisham adaptations . grisham on the screen is like grisham on the page : glossy , undemanding , straight-ahead potboilers , perfect for mass consumption . but surprisingly , the client is slightly more than that . even if the whole does not quite equal the sum of its more impressive parts , the client edges out the firm as the best of the three grisham films . the client , like the firm , benefits most from a wealth of solid performances . the scenes in which sarandon and jones tangle are masterful , sparks of raw intelligence flying between the two gifted performers , making it regrettable that there aren't more . newcomer brad renfro actually has far more screen time than either of his big-name co-stars , and he is occasionally very good , particularly when showing a bit of an edge . the best performance , however , might be that of mary- louise parker as mark's mother . in many ways it is a better written part than any of the three leads , rich and complex , and parker is wonderful in a scene-stealing supporting role similar to holly hunter and david strathairn in the firm . there is so much good acting going on in the client ( aside from anthony lapaglia , whose cartoonish mafioso does everything but grab his crotch ) that it's easy to overlook what a hum-drum thriller it is . this isn't true of the first half hour , where director joel schumacher keeps the tension notched up high . then , as grisham plots tend to do , the client's sputters out like a released balloon . the climactic showdown is abrupt , silly and very unsatisfying , an appropriate wrap-up to a sluggish second hour . it almost seems as though schumacher realized that the suspense elements were the least interesting , and did only what was necessary for resolution . in fact , the client is much more effective as a character study than it is as a thriller . but that relationship is a bit rushed , and while both the firm and the pelican brief overstayed their welcome , the client might have benefited from an additional ten or fifteen minutes of character development . it might have made the maudlin closing scene between reggie and mark more tolerable . still , the client's first- rate cast carries it through its many lulls . provided you aren't heading to see the client expecting a pulse-pounding thriller , its possible you could be in for a pleasant surprise . 
starring : taylor nichols , chris eigeman , tushka bergen , mira sorvino , pep munne . screenplay/director : whit stillman . i remember missing whit stillman's metropolitan when it was in theaters in 1990 , and eagerly awaiting its video release . i had heard stillman compared to woody allen , and i've always been a sucker for urbane banter . but i was disappointed with metropolitan ; pithy dialogue only goes so far without any real story . barcelona is a step in the right direction , but just a step . there is more substance unifying stillman's clever observations , but barcelona will still come off as far too slow and talky for many viewers , a 100 minute long new yorker cartoon with a view . where metropolitan suffered from too many characters too sketchily drawn , barcelona wisely narrows its focus . both performances are extremely strong , but unfortunately both characters are a bit annoying . with significant stretches of barcelona consisting almost entirely of conversations between ted and fred , their prep school petulance grows tiresome , and you begin to wish for absolutely anything to _happen_ to these guys . when it does , it's a welcome change of pace . if there is one thing stillman does know how to do , it's how to load his films with quotable lines . ted has a sharp little monologue about why he has decided only to date " plain , or even rather homely " women ( a resolution he promptly breaks ) ; fred counters with observations on his confusion over the correct way to shave , as well as why american society is mis-perceived as more violent ( " we're just better shots " ) . there are a number of moments which prompt genuine laughs , but stillman doesn't seem to know how to incorporate them into a plot . everything comes to a halt so that his characters can trade bon mots , and it begins to seem as though stillman has simply set up his camera in front of an expatriate version of the algonquin round table . when he does pull out some quirky , character-based physical comedy , like ted cutting a rug to " pennsylvania 6-5000 " while reading the bible , it's as though he's jolted the entire production to life with a cattle prod . only eventually it settles back into wry philosophizing . barcelona does manage some keen insights into european perceptions about american society and politics , and when stillman focuses his attention on that theme he is frequently on target . his most perceptive observation connects the attitudes of europeans towards american tastes to the miserable quality of hamburgers abroad , and it was one of those rare movie moments where i saw the world , if only briefly , through different eyes . that achievement alone warrants praise , and a moderate recommendation . but i sense there will be many viewers who will grow restless waiting for stillman's characters to get a life . barcelona is just clever enough to get by on its charm , but stillman really needs to stop wallowing in his own cleverness and start telling stories . 
screenplay : david twohy . director : deran sarafian . most of the time , i see a new movie on its opening weekend , and it's not just so that my reviews can be fairly fresh . such was not the case with terminal velocity , which had the chance to accumulate a mountain of negative response in the two weeks between its opening and my screening . it's difficult to preduct how those pre-conceptions will affect my own reaction . in this case , they allowed me to be pleasantly surprised . terminal velocity is frenetic and uneven , but it has a certain bone-headed charm thanks to charlie sheen's improbably dense hero . sheen plays richard " ditch " brody , a skydiving instructor with something of a reckless streak . the plot of terminal velocity is not exactly what you would call inspired ; it's basically classic hitchcock crossed with classic james bond . the plot's few twists and turns are spelled out in huge letters from the outset , and a bit clumsy in the execution . equally distracting is a tone which careens from brutal to near slapstick in moments , making for a schizophrenic experience which isn't as purely enjoyable as it might be . director deran sarafian drives the action forward relentlessly , which is usually an ideal choice for a film of this genre , but often seems merely hyperactive here . terminal velocity sometimes feels like a cockroach race -- moving fast , but in no particular direction . its saving graces are the characterizations and interaction of charlie sheen and nastassja kinski . sheen's ditch brody is just a handful of brain celss removed from his goofball hot shots ! persona , but it's a character that comes off as extremely refreshing in an action thriller . rather than being either inordinately brilliant or dumber than virtually everyone in the audience , ditch is just simple . he is quite entertaining in scenes where he is infuriated by kinski's references to his dim-wittedness , but he maintains a kind of affable puppy-dog eagerness to please . it's a simple gesture , but funny because it's clear this is no rocket scientist we're dealing with . that rescue , a wildly inventive stunt , is certainly terminal velocity's highlight . it's a gag worthy of the best bond films , and it sends terminal velocity off on a note of high energy . but it's not an isolated moment . terminal velocity is full of well-staged action sequences , and twohy's dialogue is rich with fine one-liners . though it sometimes seems a bit too busy and scattershot for its own good , it's still a perfectly enjoyable no-brainer worth a few solid laughs . 
is a light-hearted , quirky romantic romp about a date-from-hell . it most decidedly is not . it is a dark , disturbing and almost painfully honest character study which will have many viewers shifting uncomfortably in their chairs . the sensational performances of karen sillas and tom noonan should have added up to a sensational film , but they don't quite . in adapting his two person stage play , noonan manages both to under-direct and to over-direct , sacrificing much of the story's potential entertainment value for a more serious tone which simply doesn't ring quite as true . the first half of what happened was . . . , which establishes the characters through the mundane , is by far its most effective . it's a beautiful and sensitive performance , and jackie's genuineness provides a perfect counterpoint to michael's intellectual reserve , as he tries to maintain the upper hand through sarcasm without even knowing it . it soon becomes clear that jackie is far more perceptive than michael , and as the power dynamic shifts , michael crumbles . the development of this shift through the dinner is fascinating , if almost too understated . however , noonan is not content to deliver a sort of my dinner date with andre , and it is when the script takes an abrupt left turn into psychodrama that the film falters . noonan simply takes the scene too far ; children's voices whisper in the background , the camera shoots through the windows of a dollhouse , and sillas is lit with flickering candles like a voodoo priestess . the self-conscious arsty-ness of noonan's direction takes a serious scene and makes it almost a self-parody . michael's big breakdown is also played far too broadly . eventually begins too feel extremely scripted , losing the pinpoint honesty which had been its strength . is that it is much more interesting when its observations about human interaction are inspiring nervous laughter than when they are supposed to be inspiring serious contemplation . stories based on big emotional confrontations between characters are tricky to transfer from the stage to the screen . noonan only got it half right . 
starring : kurt russell , james spader , jaye davidson . director : roland emmerich . stargate is a movie from out of a time warp , and i'm not just talking about the plot . stargate feels a lot like many of those films : overblown , underwritten , yet still moderately entertaining . perhaps it was the sense of nostalgia it inspired in me , but stargate offered just enough to keep me interested , despite all of its bombast and unfulfilled promise . for the first half hour , stargate seems to be pretty comfortably on the right track , with a solid premise . spader in particular is quite appealing , playing the perfect slightly dazed academic ; the early scenes in which he shows up the military scientists are low-key and quite a lot of fun . in fact , for all its $50 million scale , spader may be the best thing stargate has going for it . unfortunately , he makes kurt russell look like a large piece of plywood by comparison . as such he fits right in with the rest of the advance team , an interchangeable collection of macho grunts . once we get to the other side of the stargate , things are still wildly uneven , and we're not even talking about those plausibility questions that plague most science fiction fare . the real issue is that as good as stargate looks , it's awfully slow-moving . the sets and costume design are impressive , and even the desert sandscapes have a certain beauty to them . but stargate falls victim to its attempts at creating a fully-realized alternative civilization . it's a nice touch that they don't speak the " miracle english " common to alien civilizations , but it makes the soldiers' interactions with them extremely tedious . the fascination of some of the younger ones with the human aliens is believable , but a scene involving one of them reacting to kurt russell's lighter as magic is as old as the hills . it's as though director and co-scripter roland emmerich paid so much attention to cultural detail that he missed the big picture--providing a truly engaging story . the climax of stargate is a major improvement , full of energy and creativity . it's a shame that jaye davidson's ra is such a boring villain , gliding along through the ship making imperious pronouncements in a voice bearing a frightening similarity to that of jabba the hut . there is really very little in ra's role except ordering guards around , so the threat isn't nearly as threatening as it might be . the bottom line , though , is that even as i was thinking about how ridiculous some of the resolutions were ( including final decisions made by both russell's and spader's characters ) , i realized that i had enjoyed myself . and for a matinee price , i generally don't ask for much more . 
screenplay : kevin wade and chris conrad . director : ivan reitman . in 1988 , arnold schwarzenegger , danny devito and ivan reitman set the standard for " high concept " with their comic vehicle twins . in hollywood pitch-meeting parlance , it could be reduced to five words-- " schwarzenegger and devito are twins " --and proved that sometimes a simple idea and the right talent could add up to $100 million even with a paper-thin script . and in a limited sense , it works . junior is so simple and gently directed that the warm performances of emma thompson and schwarzenegger manage to struggle through a script that always goes for the easy gag , and even then can't make most of them particularly funny . the impregnation is a success , but of course complications ensue . this is not hollywood's first attempt at a pregnant man story , and the disastrous first attempt ( the joan rivers-directed billy crystal vehicle rabbit test ) would not seem to inspire eagerness to give the premise another try . the joke in junior , of course , isn't just that a man is pregnant ; it's that the man in question is arnold schwarzenegger . schwarzenegger's choices of roles in the last several years have demonstrated a mastery of his own image , as he alternates action blockbusters with against-type comedies , and he has proved remarkably adept at both . as limited as his acting skills may be , he is usually very likable , and junior is no exception . those familiar with thompson only from her branagh/shakespeare and merchant/ivory efforts will be quite pleasantly surprised by her goofy performance in junior . her dianna , a clumsy and socially inept scientist , is the perfect match for schwarzenegger's hesse , and thompson's delightful moments of physical comedy make her scenes with arnold very appealing . that's really what junior has going for it : appealing performers at their most appealing . most of the jokes are based on the obvious incongruities of schwarzenegger in the family way--his appearance in a prosthetic belly ; his emotional response to a sappy kodak commercial ; his delivery of lines like , " my nipples are very sensitive . " and it's only because schwarzenegger seems to be having so much fun that any of it works . other bits , including the obligatory scene of a baby with urine streaming down its leg , are too trite for any amount of good will to make them work . the script , credited to kevin wade and chris conrad , is full of missed opportunities and silliness instead of any real inventiveness . frank langella , who was so good in the reitman-directed dave last year , is woefully underused as the obligatory villain , and gets the most obvious comeuppance available . perhaps that's the word that defines junior best : obvious . this is terrain we've all seen many , many times before . but the cast of junior is so engaging that it feels like we're seeing that terrain in a very comfortable car , in the company of old friends . 
screenplay : paul attanasio . director : barry levinson . you know that angry white male we've all been hearing so much about since the november election ? well , i've just figured it out : he's michael douglas . ever since fatal attraction in 1987 , douglas has seemed to be there every time a film exploded into an infuriating zeitgeist phenomenon , and douglas himself has mastered the role of the somewhat-less-than-innocent victim . what you don't have is anything nearly as controversial as it might first appear to be . while it is well-paced and generally entertaining , it tries so hard to be everything for everyone that it misses the chance to be genuinely incendiary . tom ultimately resists temptation , but meredith is not pleased . those familiar with other michael crichton works ( jurassic park , rising sun ) will not be stunned to learn that the characters in disclosure are stick figures ; i somehow suspect that if crichton could figure out a plot that didn't require human beings , he'd jump on it in a minute . it's dense with twists , turns and intrigue , perhaps too dense for a screen adaptation ever to cover thoroughly enough . because there is so much ground to cover , director barry levinson keeps the film moving like a rocket , and it could leave some viewers struggling to keep up . while there is very little he can do with meredith's character , he does give tom a slightly shadier personality so that his experience becomes something of a comeuppance . he also creates some marveous dialogue which may be disclosure's strongest asset . comic dennis miller is also sharp as one of tom's co-workers , but i suspect that many of his best lines were his own creations . attanasio's work is efficient and clever , and it makes disclosure engaging most of the time . unfortunately , attanasio also appears to have been given orders to give every possible side of the story equal time , and it is when disclosure becomes a high school debate that it becomes tiresome . crichton's novel was unapologetic about the role-reversal in the sexual harrassment story , since to him it was simply a plot device in a corporate thriller . the film , on the other hand , both tries to be * about * sexual harrassment and to avoid appearing as reactionary as crichton , and gives everyone a chance to make a speech . in a story as tightly constructed as disclosure , the dueling pontifications are a real time drain . disclosure is a slick , well- photographed film , and it's nice to see levinson directing a winner after the twin bombs toys and jimmy hollywood . still , it could have been much more effective had it spent less time chewing its nails over how politically correct it wanted to be . 
screenplay : andy breckman and michael leeson . director : fred schepisi . a movie like i . q . is like a souffle . when you're trying to mix whimsy , romance , comedy and ( of all things ) physics together , the whole recipe can collapse under its own weight without the right chef . director fred schepisi made all the right decisions in 1987's roxanne , a film that could have been either cloying or tedious in the wrong hands . i . q . isn't quite as successful as roxanne , but it is far more entertaining than it has any right to be . while it's rarely laugh-out-loud funny , it's pleasant , low-key and consistently charming . it's not easy to describe exactly why i . q . works , because in many ways it's extremely simple and predictable . there are the standard complications , and none of them are particularly hilarious . i think i . q . 's greatest strength may be that it uses its premise to perfection . einstein isn't part of the story simply as high-concept gag ; love really does become a kind of physics formula , and its incorporation into the story is delightful . matthau is a marvelous einstein , a gentle matchmaker with a twinkle in his eye . the running commentary they provide on philosophy , science and love is a goofy little trick that turns them into an almost fantastical greek chorus . it's exactly what schepisi was able to do with roxanne : keep the tone light and coax fine supporting performances out of every last supporting character . of course , a romantic comedy is generally only as successful as the chemistry between its stars , so how do ryan and robbins fare together ? quite well , and that's mostly because screenwriters andy breckman and michael leeson take their time bringing them together . this is far from ryan's best work -- i thought she was coasting much of the time -- but a mediocre ryan is still worth a lot in a role like this . robbins , on the other hand , turns in one of his most appealing performances yet . many of his previous roles have been one-note jobs , either simpletons or sleazes , but ed is a warm and engaging character which shows that robbins has a bright future as a romantic leading man . their scenes together may not set the screen on fire , but they are comfortable enough together that the smiles just keep coming . i didn't expect much from i . q . , and it really didn't deliver all that much . i just had fun , and i left with a smile . it doesn't take a genius to realize that achievement is worth a compliment . 
every time a film based on actual events or including real historical figures appears , it seems that there are scholars stepping over each other to decry its lack of faithfulness to historical fact . whether it's shoeless joe jackson batting right handed in field of dreams , or the condensed time line in the recent quiz show , or any of a hundred other possible examples , there seems to be a widespread refusal to allow film dramas to be exactly that : dramatizations of real events , no more documentary than the re-creations on " america's most wanted . " as a moviegoer , my only question is , " does it succeed as drama ? " the answer for immortal beloved is that while it is sometimes quite enjoyable , it is better experienced than analyzed . perhaps the best , if most precious , way to describe immortal beloved is as ludwig von-adeus . writer/director rose has mounted a sumptuous production , gloriously scored with the subject's compositions and intended to bring some humanity to a figure most often seen as a wildly coiffed bust on a marble pedestal . and he manages to deliver some marvelous sequences : the sea of mourners greeting beethoven's casket ; his deafness revealed to an audience as he attempts to conduct an orchestra ; the beautifully staged premiere of the 9th symphony , as the " ode to joy " accompanies flashbacks to beethoven's difficult childhood . rose manages to wed sound to image in that manner that is uniquely cinematic , evocative without ever lapsing into pretentiousness . as successful as immortal beloved is as a sensory experience , it is not nearly as successful at establishing character . for better or worse , amadeus managed to make mozart a character we could relate to ; immortal beloved does not quite manage that feat with beethoven . but the fragmented nature of the narrative allows us only unsatisfying glimpses of the man beethoven might have been , and even rose's tendency to film oldman in medium and long shots contributes to this distancing effect . rose's choice of the " immortal beloved " letter might have seemed perfect as a jumping off point for examining beethoven as a character , but too often it just doesn't work . when the film stops dead for schindler to talk to one woman or another about beethoven , we expect some insight , and there just isn't all that much . though i have focused on many of immortal beloved's failings , i should make it clear that on the whole , i enjoyed it , particularly in the moment i was watching it . music coordinator georg solti fills the theater with grand music , and those scenes which simply feature music accompanying rose's images are quite powerful . but afterwards , i realized what that made immortal beloved : a somewhat ineffectual plot connecting some exceedingly well-made music videos . 
screenplay : susan shilliday and bill wittliff . director : edward zwick . legends of the fall is a big , dumb bassett hound of a movie . it stares at you with big sad eyes , slobbers all over you and practically begs you to like it . it's muddled , bombastic , and often gets by purely on style points , yet for some reason , inexplicably , it also manages to be occasionally entertaining . i could spend days listing all the things that are wrong with legends of the fall , and still i'd be left with the fact that something worked . radiating the kind of charisma that screen actors just don't seem to have any more , he single-handedly makes legends of the fall watchable . for about half an hour , legends of the fall is more than simply passable ; it's a grand , beautifully filmed family drama with tremendous potential . all the performances are perfectly tuned , the interactions between the brothers are convincing and the story is well-paced . a film which had been moving along at a confident and leisurely pace suddenly goes into a dead sprint that seems to get faster and faster , until by the end i felt quite relieved that it was over . fortunately , the film's technical credits are spectacular . director edward zwick scored a successful screen melodrama with glory , and he appears to use many of the same tricks in legends . in fact , the war scenes here might easily have been the same scenes from glory with different uniforms added by computer . the score is by james horner , and as usual he lays the strings on thick as syrup , but it works in legends . as the narrative becomes more and more stream of consciousness , the look and sound of legends of the fall actually seem to improve . for all that , the best thing that zwick puts on the screen is pitt . he is asked to slog through several melodramatic moments in legends of the fall , but his dark intensity keeps them from being as overblown as they might have been , and he may be as convincing a crier as any male actor in many years . then zwick comes through with an exceptional final fifteen minutes , including a retribution montage which might strike some as a bit too reminiscent of the godfather films yet works in its own right . legends of the fall is by no stretch of the imagination great filmmaking , and occasionally it's flat-out silly . however , when you put an ascending star in an old-fashioned western epic , anything is possible . and for legends of the fall , it's just enough . 
screenplay : laurice elehwany & rick copp and bonnie turner & terry turner . director : betty thomas . it is official now : i have become everything that i despise . i am of a certain age where my youth has become a marketing tool , re-packaged and returned to me for nostalgic consumption . but those attempts to this point ( the beverly hillbillies , the flintstones ) have basically left me unmoved . the brady bunch . . . now , there's a different story . i grew up with them , and i remember their dopey antics with an inexplicable affection . so the upshot is , they finally got to me . the brady bunch movie is a movie that most likely was put together by chimps , and i had fun anyway . i think any discussion of the brady bunch movie must begin with this statement : you had to be there . familiarity with the series , whether in first run or its endless incarnation in reruns , is essential , since the film is composed almost entirely of bits and pieces of plots from the series . when the audience laughs at marcia being hit in the face by a football , or peter's cracking voice , or greg's attempt to turn himself into rock star johnny bravo , it isn't because any of these situations are inherently funny ; in fact , they are really fairly inane . but they are so familiar , so much a part of the fabric of growing up in america at a particular time , that watching the brady bunch movie is like re-discovering an old toy . even if you realize that it was sort of a stupid toy , you are still going to play with it , and smile while you're doing it . the brady bunch movie was going to sink or swim on the basis of casting , and there are both successes and failures . shelly long has florence henderson's mannerisms down pat as carol , and gary cole is a hoot as he pronounces brady platitudes with a deadpan solemnity . the dead ringer award goes to christine taylor , who looks and sounds so much like original marcia maureen mccormick that it is truly frightening . less impressive are jennifer elise cox , whose slightly unhinged jan is too reminiscent of melanie hutsell's " saturday night live " characterization of jan , and henriette mantel , who does a version of housekeeper alice which includes pratfalls and , inexplicably , a leather bustier . there are about equal parts homage and parody in the brady bunch movie , and both have their moments , but what surprised me most was the way the film managed to recall a simpler time without mockery . make no mistake , the brady bunch movie is occasionally quite sluggish , and required about a thimbleful of creativity . at the same time , it made me wistful not only for a piece of my youth , but also for an era when families were functional , communities seemed closer , and " have a nice day " was something people actually meant . 
i have this idea for a screenplay , and so do about a million other people in the los angeles area alone . the form seems so accessible--three acts , 120 pages and a couple of meaty characters--that the allure is easy to see . every once in a while , one of these ideas will end up on the screen , and every once in an even greater while , the writer will get the chance to direct his own story . this can be both a good thing and a bad thing for a novice ; a single vision can be unifying or it can be self-indulgent . alan jacobs' nina takes a lover is an extremely intriguing concept , and a handsomely made film . i just kept thinking that it needed another hand in the production to point out some major distractions . on one level , nina takes a lover works wonderfully , and that is in the examination of nina's character . gradually , however , this somewhat bland nina makes sense . her thrilling experimentation with her lover is sometimes uncomfortably to watch ; she asks him challenging questions and expects answers , something that apparently is not possible with her husband , and she feels more adventurous , more sexy . the problem with this very affecting story is that it is trapped in an awkward structure . nina takes a lover has the confessional feel of a stage play , and it might have worked better in that medium . the segments involving the discussions with the reporter heighten the staginess , pull the audience away from the more interesting events of nina's affair , and , perhaps worst of all , suggest a rookie director resorting to telling you what he couldn't figure out how to show visually . the sub-plot involving the affair between nina's friend and her annoying lover is similarly unnecessary , adding only some silly comic relief . even that adjustment would not have addressed jacobs' sometimes distracting over-direction . there are moments when scenes are spliced together in a manner which is too self-consciously artsy and draws too much attention to the strange cutaways , as though jacobs didn't trust the ability of his narrative to hold an audience's attention . the editing is also quite clumsy on occasion , the choice of who is in a shot somewhat arbitrary in appearance , and many of the performances pitched at a level of hyper-seriousness which veers dangerously close to melodrama . still , nina takes a lover is a thoughtful , atmospheric film which tells a great story . if alan jacobs the director could serve alan jacobs the writer better , he could have a bright future . 
starring : dustin hoffman , rene russo , morgan freeman , cuba gooding jr . , kevin spacey , donald sutherland . screenplay : laurence dworet and robert roy pool . director : wolfgang petersen . you've got to love it when hollywood producers find themselves scrambling to be the first out of the blocks with an idea . though its conventional action climax doesn't fulfill the promise of a gripping first hour , it's still a satisfying popcorn thriller . the first half of outbreak , which actually deals with the spread of the disease , is as tense an hour as i have spent at the movies in a long time . director wolfgang petersen makes some great decisions filming scenes like a tour through the army's medical facility , which moves ominously from labs studying relatively benign viruses to those studying the bad boys . there is also a wickedly funny moment when an infected man sneezes in a movie theater , and we watch particles flying through the air into other people's mouths . what eventually becomes clear is that petersen's direction is orders of magnitude better than the script from which he is working . the attempts at humor are frequently limp , the performances ( except those by space and gooding ) perfunctory and the characters of the standard , one-dimensional action film variety . and those aren't the only elements that warrant comparison to standard action films , as the conclusion becomes not a down-to-the-wire hunt for a cure in the lab , but a down-to-the-wire helicopter chase , or rather several down-to-the-wire helicopter chases . the sequences are exciting and well-filmed , but they don't belong in this movie any more than a u-boat battle would have belonged in schindler's list . i have a personal beef with outbreak as well , namely that it relies so much on government conspiracy theories . the prospect of a deadly disease wreaking havoc is powerful enough without resorting to paranoia-mongering , and i have yet to see much evidence that any really big secret can be kept in the talk show age , let alone for thirty years as is the case in outbreak . frankly , it's sloppy plotting , and indicative of outbreak's roots as part of a race to be first rather than best . for one hour , outbreak keeps the tension high , but petersen could have done much more with a script just a re-write or two more polished . 
muriel's wedding presents me with a critical poser : what do you do with a movie when there was only one thing about a movie that you liked , but you liked that one thing a * lot * ? i mean , * really * liked it a lot . muriel's wedding is a truly disjointed effort , bouncing from slapstick comedy to depressing domestic drama , but its lead character is a marvelous creation , played with love and sensitivity by toni collette . i was always interested in what might happen to her , but i was frequently disappointed by what happened around her . does that one great piece outweigh all the other less effective pieces ? in a word , yes . . . but just barely . here is what is right with muriel's wedding : toni collette , who walks the fine line between making muriel sympathetic and making her pathetic . she does the most with her expressive mouth , as her bouts of giddiness cause her to burst into a huge toothy smile , frequently with her tongue stuck out through them . it is a marvelous piece of work , made all the more impressive because she never tries to inject any irony into muriel's decidedly un-liberated dreams . here is what is wrong with muriel's wedding : muriel is stuck in an episodic story which doesn't add up to all that much . then the switch to sydney brings a tragic turn which seems really inappropriate , followed by a bride-for-hire section again focused on comedy . finally , there is yet another tragedy , and a decision by muriel for which the justification doesn't seem quite right . it is often difficult to get caught up in muriel's story , because it takes so many detours . she is also surrounded by characters who are mostly paper-thin by comparison . griffiths has some nice moments as the brassy rhonda , and jeanie dryden has a couple of heart-breaking scenes as muriel's beaten-down-by-life mother . but bill hunter is merely loud and slightly oily as muriel's father , and sophie lee leads a group of stereotypically catty barbie dolls who snub muriel . i can understand the attraction--muriel is a splendidly crafted character , acted with a grace that made me care about her life . she deserved something more cohesive than this jittery wedding . 
screenplay : richard price . director : barbet schroeder . to answer the most obvious question first : no , david caruso's naked posterior does not appear in kiss of death , although it might have been appropriate . caruso's first opportunity for an " i told you so " comes in kiss of death , but he might be advised to postpone any self- congratulation . in a film that is erratic but frequently intense , his casting in the lead role is the most glaring flaw . the screenplay for kiss of death , written by richard price based on a 1947 film noir of the same name , is a dense piece of plotting , but an extremely confident one . like a novel , kiss of death unfolds in well-developed pieces , building towards a solid conclusion with very little extraneous material . the plot's twists are both relevant and unexpected , and director barbet schroeder keeps a steady hand on the pace . yet somehow , in the middle of all the clockwork plotting , gaping flaws in logic and flat-out sloppiness appear . then , near the end of the film , one of the big payoff revelations is spoiled by an unnecessary establishing shot . it sometimes seems that schroeder is so busy painting the trim on the house that is kiss of death that he fails to notice it's missing a wall . it's a good thing that so many of the people in that house are so interesting . he is mis-used in the conclusion for a gimmicky applause moment , but otherwise turns in stellar work . add stanley tucci's duplicitous d . a . and helen hunt as jimmy's recovering alcoholic wife , and you have one of the best supporting casts since pulp fiction . unlike pulp fiction , however , the lead performances are not of the same caliber . nicolas cage is an actor who has shown the ability to play everything from romantic leads to villains , but there is no center to little junior . as for caruso , he is given a role that would be a challenge to make sympathetic by an actor with much greater range . caruso is unable to give jimmy any humanity , delivering every line in the same hushed , primed-to-explode manner . only he never does explode , and it is particularly telling that jimmy's one big emotional outburst occurs behind a closed door . we need to see jimmy as a charater reacting to what is happening to him , but by playing him with an omnipresent hangdog resignation , caruso might have been the kiss of death for a potentially engrossing thriller . 
screenplay : charles edward pogue , from a story by pogue and patrick read johnson . director : rob cohen . for my money , the best joke in dragonheart is one which probably was unintentional , and which works on a level entirely outside the world of the film . the joke is that , once draco speaks , bowen isn't instantly aware that this is the dragon he has been seeking for those twelve years . even after that long , you'd think sean connery's voice would be recognizable . of course , that is exactly why connery was chosen to give voice to the wise , crafty , wrongly-accused draco . it is one of the most distinctive voices in film , a rumbling burr which can be commanding , whimsical , regal or intimate at any given time , and it allows dragonheart to pull off an unexpected trick : you spend as much time listening to the dragon as you do watching it . draco is a marvelous creation by industrial light and magic , fluid and expressive , with a thoroughly unique look and style of movement , and it would have been easy enough to let it be a flashy showpiece . for a big-budget summer fantasy , dragonheart is really a film of smaller charms like the winning characterization of draco , like the goofy monk/would-be troubador ( peter postlethwaite ) who takes it upon himself to chronicle bowen's exploits , like david thewlis' snarling , reptilian villain . but there is something ever so slightly askew in director rob cohen's pacing which prevents dragonheart from taking off into a level of pure enjoyability . none of the relationships ( bowen and draco , bowen and einon , bowen and a feisty damsel played by dina meyer ) ever really click , the battle scenes are serviceable but perfunctory , and there are moments of dark ages-meets-new age mysticism which are played with an almost cloying straightness ( particularly the dewy-eyes-heavenward finale which i have seen in enough spielberg and spielberg-clone films to last me a lifetime ) . on one level , dragonheart is a rather silly and simplistic fairy tale , with a good knight , an evil king , a damsel in distress , swords and sorcery . yet there is an interesting twist to charles edward pogue's script , a redemption story involving bowen's motivations for his dragon-dispensing activities . that makes bowen a complicated hero for an action-fantasy ; that also makes dennis quaid all wrong . quaid's sly grin has carried him far , but the reason it hasn't carried him farther is that he's never convincing when he is supposed to be in a bad mood -- the wrinkled-nosed grimace which passes for quaid's " angry face " always look like the put-on anger of someone who is just about to burst into laughter . as a result , the rounded character of pogue's script is flattened on the screen , and ends up seeming considerably less vibrant than his animated co-star . for all its flaws , i was surprised how far dragonheart went on the strength of that one character . toy story proved that an audience could cheer for a character generated on a hard-drive , and draco is such a character . his plight in dragonheart is probably the only one which really connects , and it connects because he has both dignity and -- dare i say it -- humanity . without sean connery lending an air of nobility , dragonheart is yet another good-looking but empty summer spectacle ; with connery , it is a bit more fun , a bit more involving , and a bit more familiar . 
screenplay : gerald dipego . director : jon turtletaub . jon turtletaub has a quality as a director which seems to be fairly uncommon lately : patience . he had surprise successes with his last two films , 1993's cool runnings and last year's while you were sleeping , and generally those successes were attributed to the disney underdog formula and sandra bullock's rising star , respectively . while those factors certainly played a significant role , i also believe that audiences appreciated a style which told simple stories simply . turtletaub's direction gave you the impression that he felt he was doing his job best if he stood back , allowed his narrative to unfold , and didn't draw attention to himself . that is a refreshing perspective in an era of music video auteurs , but apparently it also can be taken a bit too far . phenomenon finds turtletaub bringing his leisurely manner to a story which , somewhere along the line , needed a bit more energy . i had feared that phenomenon would be yet another tiresome spin on " benevolent stranger among us " tales like e . t . , starman and last year's odious powder . the latter was an example of the worst kind , the kind of film whose sole purpose seems to be to make us feel better about ourselves for being so much more understanding than the oppressive , narrow-minded cowards in the film . there are whispers of that theme in phenomenon , but screenwriter gerald dipego's story is much more focused on george's reaction to the changes in himself than on the reaction of others to those changes . the moments when phenomenon does begin to feel like a " benevolent stranger " film are rare , but they are also rather telling . the villainous feds and scientists are only bit players , not really serving to drive the narrative , and the " mob " is more like a rather insistent group of autograph-seekers . turtletaub seems uncomfortable with such dramatic devices , and his sense of restraint is admirable . the problem is that he and dipego really don't provide much in place of those devices to generate conflict . it's a perfectly sweet romance , but it underscores the lack of passion in phenomenon ; the big moment between george and lace has her washing and cutting his hair . a film like phenomenon demands more moments of catharsis , opportunities to feel deeply for the plight of the hero . turtletaub banks on the rosy glow of phedon papamichael's cinematography , thomas newman's jaunty score and the fine performances of his cast ( including a lovably eccentric forest whitaker ) to generate the good will needed to carry phenomenon across the finish line . they carry it remarkably far , but as phenomenon neared the two hour mark , i began to wish turtletaub had gone for a bit less serenity and a bit more urgency . 
" it's not showgirls " one trailer for striptease bluntly announces , capping off a marketing campaign which may be the first in recent memory to attempt to convince the movie-going public that a new film is _nothing_ like a previous film . sure , it works the other way all the time , thanks to pre-fabricated critical blurbs like " this year's forrest gump " or reminders of the director's previous successes , but the stink of showgirls is such that it threatens to contaminate anything featuring a pelvis and a pole . of course , if you remembered that writer-director andrew bergman is behind such comedic gems as the in-laws , the freshman and honeymoon in vegas , you'd know not to expect showgirls . the real question is whether you'd expect striptease , a film as inconsistent in its tone as it is occasionally hilarious . moore received the surprising sum of $12 . 5 million to bump-and-grind her way through striptease , and at the very least the producers should take solace in the fact that she picked up dancing a heck of a lot faster than she has picked up this whole acting thing . there is something both smug and overly earnest about moore's standard screen pose , as though she never wanted there to be any doubt that she felt deeply about whatever her predicament might be , but also that nothing could stop her if she set her mind to it . in striptease , that is a major problem . this is supposed to be a frisky comedy , but moore's deadly serious performance acts like ankle weights on a swimmer . there are scenes between her and armand assante which seem to come from a second-rate tv-movie -- " baring her soul : the erin grant story . " that's a real shame , because there are plenty of moments in striptease where bergman's wonderfully weird sense of humor gets to shine through . burt reynolds is completely over the top as dilbeck , a pathetic , fetishistic drunkard who coats himself in vaseline and sniffs erin's dryer lint before addressing a young christians' conference , and there is something improbably enjoyable about the way reynolds doesn't even pretend to modulate his performance . bergman makes fine use of oddball supporting characters , and seasons striptease liberally with his trademark unpredictability , like a priceless scene during the film's climax involving erin's daughter , two well-endowed dancers and a jump-rope . there are plenty of laughs in striptease , enough to make it moderately entertaining , but the reason striptease isn't a better movie is that they're the wrong _kind_ of laughs for the material . based on carl hiaasen's novel , the story demands a darker edge in its political satire , a sense of irony that the topless dancer is one of the few characters in the film with any morals . that simply isn't andrew bergman's style ; his comedy may be wild , but it's always good-natured . when burt reynolds' congressman is as absurd a character as the general played by richard libertini in the in-laws , it's tough to extract any biting commentary . the result is a film which is moving in several different directions at once : the source material is trying to make it dark , bergman is trying to make it silly , and moore is trying to make it serious . when it's silly , striptease is super , but a lot of the time it's not clear _what_ striptease is . except , of course , that it's _not_ showgirls . 
screenplay : fran walsh , peter jackson . director : peter jackson . all those who worried that peter jackson's first big studio film would be a sell-out , please step forward to receive your slaps on the wrist . yes , it is true that many independent and international directors have found that their first steps into hollywood left something foul on the bottom of their shoes ( see kevin smith's mallrats , lee tamahori's mulholland falls or john dahl's unforgettable for just the most recent examples ) . jackson's direction is still in top form in the frighteners , a comedy-thriller which , amazingly , works as both . unfortunately , his story and casting choices are not quite up to the task . it's a cozy little arrangement , but it soon becomes clear that there are other supernatural goings on in fairwater . robert zemeckis acted as executive producer of the frighteners , and if you remember his death becomes her , you will have a good idea of what to expect . the visual effects are wild and entertaining , and sometimes decidedly creepy , like an ectoplasmic face which slowly drips down a tombstone . hartman character from full metal jacket as a ghost running a very tight graveyard . the first half of the frighteners is a feast for those with a warped sense of humor , particularly those who have no problem with the idea of the decomposing judge enjoying . . . ummm . . . relations with a mummy in an egyptian museum exhibit . the main problem with the second half , quite surprisingly , turns out _not_ to be the shift from comedy to horror ; in fact , it's not so much a shift as a gradual build-up . bizarre comedy is a part of the frighteners throughout , but the suspense elements become ever more significant , until the conclusion becomes a sometimes rather bloody confrontation between frank and a pair of killers including a wonderfully unhinged dee wallace stone . jackson knows how to make an audience giggle and shiver at the same time , and it all blends into one creepy funhouse ride . no , the problem , quite simply is michael j . fox , or rather the decision to include a sub-plot for which fox is really unsuited . other characters keep telling frank -- and us -- that he is haunted by that event , but fox never manages to make frank seem like anything more than a happily sleazy con man . his attempts at showing emotional turmoil are sadly superficial ; i don't think i've ever seen someone look as thoroughly unconvincing while a glycerine tear rolled down his cheek . the back story for frank is just one of many bits and pieces which jackson and co-writer fran walsh pile onto the frighteners , making it feel like just that -- bits and pieces . with serial killers , gun-toting ghosts , lunatic g-men , snooping reporters and love interests all running around , the frighteners sometimes gets far too busy for its own good . by the time we get to a finale which includes visions of the afterlife ( both the good and bad version ) , it actually seems just plain silly . peter jackson has a welcome quality in a director , which is that he always wants to keep his audience on its toes , never quite knowing what to expect , and he is ready to entertain them any way he knows how . the frighteners is ultimately a satisfying ride which shows that hollywood hasn't shaken the life out of jackson ; now jackson needs to shake some of the loose ends out of his scripts . 
for all the talk about how safe and predictable hollywood film-making has become in recent years ( and well-deserved talk it has been ) , i think the independents have been getting a bit lazy as well . the big studios may try to duplicate the formulas of their blockbusters , but the small distributors are just as eager to duplicate the successes within their own ranks , which is why you see a lot of two kinds of film at your local art house : talky generational relationship comedies , and gritty , violent capers . many cinephiles find the former particularly annoying , but i have grown more tired of the attitude-heavy but substance-light films which worship at the altar of tarantino and turn out sour garbage like things to do in denver when you're dead . the big squeeze is a nice idea for a spin on that trend , an unspectacular but surprisingly sunny film noir -- a film blanc , if you will . i suppose that on a basic plot level not much separates the big squeeze from those same gritty , violent capers i criticized en masse . it includes sex , greed , double-crosses and characters with a certain in-your-face quirkiness , and all have an uncomfortable familiarity . what director and writer marcus deleon understands is that a change in tone can make for an entirely different story , and the big squeeze is a film which always seems to be more inviting than ominous -- jacques haitkin's cinematography is bright and cheery most of the time , mark mothersbaugh provides a bouncy score , and the characters are generally likeable . that little trick impressed me , and it is characteristic of the minor pleasures which allow the big squeeze to overcome its familiar story arc and deliberate pacing . part of what makes the big squeeze fun to watch is that benny's plan is based on completely mistaken assumptions about the other people involved -- neither tanya nor jesse is as obsessed with the money as he is , and henry may actually be _more_ obsessed with it . i wish deleon had been content with a silly subversion of noir conventions , because his attempts at more thematic depth fall somewhat flat . that is partly the result of a listless performance by lara flynn boyle , who gives tanya a flaccid personality which doesn't seem to warrant so much fascination by so many men . but for all its unevenness , the big squeeze provides an unexpected twist to a genre in which guns and gloom generally carry the day . in this case , it is a pleasant surprise to find not a single bullet fired , and every character experiencing some kind of happy ending . apparently deleon prefers to make love , not noir . 
starring : whoopi goldberg , gerard depardieu , haley joel osment . screenplay : alvin sargent . director : norman jewison . it is a frustrating thing to watch a high concept get in the way of a perfectly good film . in bogus , there is a scene in which the jimmy stewart classic harvey is showing on a television , and the reference makes you suspect that someone went into a pitch meeting to describe bogus as " harvey , but you can see the rabbit . . . and bogus could have been -- and should have been -- a simple story of mutual need , and there are plenty of reasons to believe it could have been a rather good one . instead , poster-driven film-making has turned out yet another promising but disappointing effort . there are a lot of things right with bogus , beginning with the performances . whoopi goldberg apparently decided to shake off a string of one-note trash-talkers and turn in some of her best work in years ; harriet is not the typical whoopi wiseacre , although she still gets in a few decent lines . shaggy-haired haley joel osment hovers just this side of precocity , doing surprisingly little posing and emoting as the smart but lonely albert , and he really seems to work well with other actors . the connection between goldberg and osment develops slowly , but eventually it seems quite genuine . that role , unfortunately , is the real problem with bogus , because someone should have realized that its central conceit was a big mistake . it is evident enough in the fact that depardieu really has nothing to do but strike an offended pose when someone doesn't believe in him or feed albert lines like a french teleprompter . bogus is a prop , not a character -- he is required strictly to smile benignly and to offer advice which one would expect from a child psychologist rather than an imaginary playmate . the more substantial issue from a structural standpoint is that screenwriter alvin sargent never commits to whom this story is about , and bogus is the crutch which allows him to do it . when albert and bogus are conversing , bogus is about a boy in need of comfort , and that is _not_ what it should be about . they also end up condescending both to harriet and to the audience , because we should no more be able to see bogus than we are able to see harvey . harriet's doubts are given no weight , and there is a strange lack of trust in the audience demonstrated by the refusal to allow our imaginations -- which the story seems to value so greatly -- do their work . i am certain that some viewers will find the more fanciful elements in bogus enchanting . these same viewers might also consider my pooh-poohing of those elements so much humbuggery , but to do so is to misunderstand my meaning . bogus should be fanciful ; it simply didn't need to be obvious . imagine more time spent establishing harriet's workaholic character , and less time spent on goofy scenes like albert's defense of bogus in his classroom . bogus is far from a bad film -- goldberg is too good , and there are some solid laughs -- but there is a far more affecting film to be found somewhere where a tale of redemption and imagination takes precedence over how easy it will be to construct an advertising campaign . 
you will not find many family films which radiate the fundamental warmth and decency that fly away home does , and somehow that makes it more disappointing that it is not a better film . it is a story with an agreeably casual demeanor , positive messages to spare , and virtually nothing which could give offense ( except for a pair of gratuitous profanities included in a calculated effort to avoid a " g " rating ) . yet fly away home rarely manages to make the leap from agreeable to genuinely involving . in an era where most films seem to be striving to deafen you , fly away home is a film so soft-spoken it may cause a run on the theater's assisted listening devices . i don't think that anyone will argue that the first half of fly away home is not simply lovely . the sparkling cinematography , by the gifted caleb deschanel , and mark isham's multi-faceted score contribute to the charming scenes of amy bonding with her flock , and clever low-angle shots make them more comical . as sweet and unassuming as those scenes are , it soon becomes clear that there isn't much going on beneath the surface of fly away home . on the one hand , it is refreshing that we are not beaten over the head with the metaphorical significance of amy's attachment to her avian orphans , or with weepy professions of father-daughter love after the obligatory period of estrangement . on the other hand , robert rodat and vince mckewen don't give their characters enough substance , and the nominal family drama of fly away home is muted by the absence of enough early scenes showing us amy's difficulty adjusting to her new circumstances . jeff daniels , dana delany ( as tom's girlfriend ) and terry kinney ( as tom's brother ) all do perfectly nice work , but the characters lack spark , and the story lacks the drama to accommodate their one-dimensional benevolence . it is almost as though anna paquin , still possessing the spooky detachment of the piano even with the nose ring she sports in the film's second half , infects the entire production with her preternatural serenity . there are some fanciful moments during that flight , including amy's late-night surprise at a military airfield , but other episodes serve little purpose , and the film drags a bit as it approaches its conclusion . none of this is likely to matter tremendously to young viewers , who will enjoy the adorable geese , and their parents , who will welcome the fundamental warmth and decency which they haven't seen nearly enough of . i just couldn't help wishing that fly away home , although it was based on a true story , had been pitched a bit less like a matter-of-fact documentary and allowed the conflict between amy and tom to matter a bit more . perhaps a few more voices could have been raised . 
screenplay : robert harling . director : hugh wilson . running time : 102 minutes mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) reviewed by scott renshaw . there is something so unapologetically out-of-date about the first wives club that it becomes somewhat endearing almost in spite of itself . if you remember the 1980 jane fonda-lily tomlin-dolly parton comedy 9 to 5 , you will be familiar with the basic theme of the first wives club , as well as the era from which it seems to arise . the idea of mis-treated housewives wreaking terrible vengeance on the pig-men who done 'em wrong is likely to cause much hand-wringing in the sensitive 1990s , and i might buy into that if the first wives club seemed at all interested in the real problems of real people . what it really turns out to be is a silly sit-com of a movie with lots of bark but very little bite . for a while , it is entertaining enough to watch the stars of the first wives club sink their teeth into the kind of juicy roles which are not generally available to women their age . that context makes hawn's part the most fun -- elise is an aging film actress using every surgical means at her disposal to fight off the ravages of time and avoid playing " the mother . " the first wives club is not a particularly creative revenge fantasy in the first place -- the justice isn't poetic because the women go for their exes' wallets , not their middle-aged egos and libidos -- but wilson's haphazard shot selection makes it a rather clumsy one besides . everyone pauses to make sure we understand that whatever fun we might have been having was all in the service of a very important message . it is even more disappointing that one of our heroines actually reconciles with the husband we just spend an hour and a half cheering against , but i suppose that is actually in keeping with the retro feel of the first wives club . there are several small pleasures in the first wives club -- like showgirls ingenue elizabeth berkeley in the karmically glorious role of a talentless young actress -- and one large disappointment . as a pilot for a network sit-com , it is fairly enjoyable ; as a big-screen comedy , it is a pilot for a network sit-com . 
i know that americans love an underdog , but really . . . enough already . it is tempting to sell the compelling story behind the movie ( particularly if you arc concerned about whether there is a compelling story _in_ the movie ) , but i believe that there are negative consequences to turning every independent film-maker to come down the pike into horatio alger . these young directors are experiencing success , but it is success with an asterisk , because the audiences have been asked to appreciate their work not on its merit but because they worked so darned hard . ed's next move is a perfectly pleasant little romantic comedy , an unassuming and unpretentious character study which makes more than a casual not to annie hall . walsh has fashioned an outsider's-eye-view valentine to new york's idiosyncracies the way allen fashions insider's-eye-view valentines , and both films find neurosis getting in the way of a potential romance ; walsh even cribs from annie hall's more surreal moments , like a scene with translators interpreting the conversation in which anne breaks up with eddie which recalls annie hall's sub-titles scene . still , there is an appealing performance by matt ross as a smart , likeable protagonist who , blessedly , is not a self-absorbed aspiring artist of some sort like so many indie film protagonists , and solid supporting work from kevin carroll as a ladies' man who is not a stereotypical jerk . although walsh provides few laugh-out-loud moments , he also doesn't seem wrapped up in showing off his own cleverness , and the result is a comedy which makes you feel comfortable . and that is about all it does . there is a place for entertainments like ed's next move , and you could spend your seven dollars at the movies in far worse ways , but it would not surprise me to see a rush to anoint walsh as the next edward ( the brothers mcmullen ) burns or kevin ( clerks ) smith . there is a disturbing tendency among critics ( and yes , i include myself among them ) to treat an independent film like a high school play , where it is considered a great show if everyone remembers their lines and no one trips over the set . the thing is that those high school actors and directors turn into college actors and directors , and mere competence suddenly isn't quite as cute . getting a film made -- independent or otherwise -- is a brutal business , but a film is no more or less worthy of praise because it was a labor of love . ed's next move has several things going for it , notably young characters who have some ambition and common sense , but walsh shows no particular facility with a camera , and his story has virtually nothing going on beneath its agreeable surface . basically , it is an amusing bit of fluff which is quite similar to other bits of fluff you have seen before , one which promises and delivers little more than a few inoffensive smiles . 
director : steve buscemi . screenplay : steve buscemi director of photography : lisa rinzler . running time : 96 minutes . palookaville ------------ // skip it director : alan taylor . screenplay : david epstein . director of photography : john thomas . running time : 92 minutes . when two films as thematically similar as trees lounge and palookaville appear virtually on top of one another , you have to take a look around at the society which inspired them . americans have always rooted for underdogs , but usually they like their underdogs to come out on top . what do we make of a pair of movies , both set in the tri-state area , which turn mere economic survival as an act of heroism ? trees lounge and palookaville may be responses to an urban america where desperation is de rigeur , but both films struggle to make black comedy out of bleak tragedy , largely because they take our sympathies for granted . there is a detached verisimilitude to the people and situations in trees lounge -- the indulgent bartender ( carol kane ) ; the barroom conversations where strangers become best friends or lovers in the space of a few hours -- which keeps it just interesting enough to earn the benefit of the doubt for a while . buscemi gives his characters full histories , and peppers the film with quirky moments like the repeatedly thwarted efforts of one young boy to buy ice cream , yet the payoffs are rather unsatisfying . trees lounge cruises along , building up atmosphere like a film in search of a tom waits soundtrack , but when it is all said and done you might wonder what buscemi wanted us to make of his cast of not-so-beautiful losers . although he manages to get you interested in what _might_ happen to them , he is not as successful at getting you to care about what _does_ happen to them . that's more than you can say about the palookas in palookaville . palookaville was inspired by a collection of short stories ( by italian writer italo calvino ) , and it feels every bit of it . there is a real lack of narrative momentum in palookaville , as stories bob and weave around the characters , giving them just enough personality ( jerry's sweet tooth , sid's soft spot for dogs ) to make it evident that they needed more . kim dickens has a few nice moments as russ's young girlfriend , but our three protagonists are never quite as sympathetic as they are pathetic . i suppose that is what makes palookaville even more disappointing than trees lounge : writer david epstein seems to assume that we will feel for his characters simply because they are in financial trouble . there are moments in palookaville when its serious turns make it clear that there is a statement about desperate times lurking beneath the attempts at gallows humor , yet there is little effort to show that the predicaments of jerry , sid and russ are beyond their control . palookaville makes the mistake of asking us to identify with three men who don't even seem to be trying , who surrender at any sign of difficulty . yes , it's rough out there , as both trees lounge and palookaville do an adequate job of presenting , but most of us already know that . social consciousness still requires a story , and characters with a motivation to make themselves -- and not just their bank accounts -- better . 
mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , nudity , violence ) running time : 121 minutes . if jude strikes you as not at all typical of what you expect when you think about films based on " classic british novels , " it is only because it is quite faithful to its source material in its subject matter . thomas hardy's _jude the obscure_ was one of the most controversial novels of its time , one which inspired outraged reaction against its portrayal of adultery , atheism and marital sexuality . jude's still-relevant theme of the consequences of non-conformity make it a natural for cinematic treatment , and michael winterbottom has directed a beautifully filmed and beautifully acted adaptation . it is somewhat unfortunate , then , that jude is so true to the narrative thrust of hardy's novel yet falls short in plumbing its thematic depths . it is often a kind of critical laziness to tick off discrepancies between a film and its source material , but in the case of jude certain omissions create gaps of logic . hossein amini's script does a largely superb job of selecting where to condense scenes and delete sub-plots , losing little relevant narrative information , but there are problems with the development of character motivations . both arabella and phillotson are reduced to minor supporting players , and we don't understand enough about what their decisions mean to the story . one pivotal sequence focuses on jude's young son , who acts in a manner dependent on hardy's characterization of him as almost supernaturally mature and fatalistic . lost also are many of the contradictory facets of sue's personality , particularly her almost phobic aversion to sex . that is not to slight winslet's performance , which is captivating . both are well directed by winterbottom , who gives jude a kinetic energy , though his rush to include all the critical events in the story might leave you a bit dizzy . also outstanding is the cinematography of eduardo serra , both in the stark black-and-white of the prologue and in the muted colors of the body of the film . jude is certainly effective film-making , but it could have been more _affecting_ . this is a story of people challenging the social order at their own peril , and once winterbottom establishes that fact , jude is quite compelling . it simply takes a terribly long time for him to establish that fact , and as a result jude is an appealing but fairly conventional star-crossed love story for much of its two hours . winslet and eccleston are always able to make you care about whether or not sue and jude will find happiness , but amini and winterbottom should have been able to build the understanding that it was impossible . there are enough powerful moments and intriguing performances in jude to hold your interest , and the story still feels daring a century removed from its publication . there is just that small missing link that leaves jude's fundamental tragedy a bit too obscure . 
screenplay : shane black . director : renny harlin . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 119 minutes . it is easy for me to understand the reasoning which pegged shane black's script for the long kiss goodnight as worth $4 million , because it includes all the elements which tend to make studio executives soil themselves in anticipation . a high concept premise , plenty of gratuitous violence , a little t&a , buddies exchanging profane one-liners , really big explosions . . . these are the stuff of blockbusters , my friends . they are also the stuff of inane , incoherent garbage , unlikely to gain any style points with inane , incoherent garbagemeister renny harlin ( cutthroat island ) at the helm . the thing is that the long kiss goodnight is a difficult film to dismiss , because it is just as often entertaining as it is actively infuriating . as inane , incoherent garbage goes , it's really not that bad . apparently that was not enough to shake his conviction that davis had the right stuff , and the long kiss goodnight sort of proves him right . there is something strangely satisfying about watching davis turn into a killing machine , while partner jackson ( as the down-on-his-luck gumshoe who usually does the ass-kicking in such films ) generally looks on ineffectually . it's primitive role-reversal stuff , but it works ; it's a great bit of business when hausfrau samantha takes a pie she has just baked in a pyrex dish and uses it to beat in the head of an assailant . jackson also gets a handful of simplistic but very funny gag lines , and even a line in which he makes fun of making up gag lines . it would be over-estimating the subtlety of the long kiss goodnight to refer to it as a satire , but its bending of conventions often works quite well . at other times , it is about as conventional as action film-making gets , and distressingly brutal . there is a sequence early in the film involving a deer hit by a car which will raise plenty of hackles , and it provides an appropriate prelude to numerous scenes of torture , disturbing fantasy/dream sequences and plenty of good old-fashioned shootings and stabbings . harlin and black also play unfair with the tired device of a child in distress , and manage to play plenty of bodily functions for gags along the way . into the middle of this rather crude mess they then drop half-hearted attempts at character development , with davis' discovery resulting in a split personality and jackson trying to redeem himself for something or other . yet i can't deny that the long kiss goodnight made me laugh , and that there was never a time when i was bored . yes , villains appear and disappear with scarcely a thought to explaining who they are or why they matter . yes , it is overloaded and overblown in a way which can make anyone who cares about good movies cringe . yes , it is sometimes becomes so violent as to be off-putting . the long kiss goodnight is an exploitation film , but it is an exploitation film with a sense of its own absurdity . you may not care at all about mitch henessey as a person , but you will probably find yourself enjoying his exasperated delivery of black's crude humor ; you may not really believe charley baltimore _is_ a person , but you might still find her exploits a guilty pleasure . the long kiss goodnight is an easy film to like , and equally easy to hate . what else can you say when you walk away from an inane , incoherent piece of garbage with a smile on your face ? 
screenplay : robert b . weide , based on the novel by kurt vonnegut . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , profanity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 113 minutes . having read most of kurt vonnegut's novels before viewing mother night , i predicted to myself that it was the most likely of vonnegut's works to make a successful transition to the screen . much of the vonnegut canon has struck me as singularly unfilmable -- including one which _was_ filmed , slaughterhouse-five -- but mother night's narrative was a relatively straightforward one , and its themes equally direct . in a sense , director keith gordon's mother night has proved me correct ; in another sense , it has proved me dreadfully wrong . thought well-crafted and moderately compelling in its own right , mother night loses a lot with the absence of vonnegut's ironic voice . where the novel was a sly social comedy , the film strives almost for greek tragedy . it is a finely constructed narrative which holds the focus on one of vonnegut's key lines : " we are what we pretend to be , so we must be careful what we pretend to be . " there is a difference , however , between retaining lines and retaining the tone of those lines , and that is where robert b . weide's script becomes a disappointment . though mother night deals with heavy subject matter -- conscience , personal identity , the holocaust -- vonnegut never resorted to heaviness to tell the story . the kind of detached irony which is vonnegut's stock in trade is tough to convey cinematically , and gordon steers instead into the twin extremes of overly straight drama ( as in the scene where campbell watches an old newsreel of himself with growing horror ) or broad comedy ( the portrayal of a collection of hate-mongers who idolize campbell ) . too often , however , the earnestness becomes burdensome . it is an example of gordon and weide's traditional filmic story-telling that they try to turn certain twists of identity or plot developments into grand surprises , when vonnegut reveals them casually through campbell's narration long before the events occur chronologically . mother night may be one of his most traditionally plotted novels , but it still isn't about the plot . . . it's about a perspective and an idea . gordon has not made a bad film ; it is well-acted and keeps you interested from moment to moment . he simply wants campbell's moment of truth to come like a thunderbolt , rather than the way vonnegut prefers to deliver it : as a single finger tapping you ever so lightly on the shoulder . 
screenplay : richard lagravenese . producers : barbra streisand , arnon milchan . director : barbra streisand . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 125 minutes . mock barbra streisand if you will for her insistence upon being photographed with the kind of back-lighting we haven't seen since stevie nicks was making music videos ; after all , you'll be in good company if you do . whatever the reasons for the rosy , soft-focus look of mirror , it is a style which works for this decidedly old-fashioned romantic comedy . it is only when the film strays from the traditions of 1940s screwball that it loses its opportunity to be a real comic treat . the mirror has two faces draws most of its charm from the appealing pairing of streisand and bridges . bridges has long been one of our most under-appreciated actors , but his versatility is on full display in the quirky role of gregory . there is a certain stock quality to the " hapless intellectual " part , but bridges gives it more warmth and self-awareness ; it is because he _knows_ that he is hapless that he resorts to such unconventional methods in the first place . streisand also does nice work making rose's growing frustration both funny and touching , and she has a wonderfully natural scene giving a lecture on love in romantic literature . in many ways , the mirror has two faces is the perfect set-up for a throwback romantic farce , but along the way to the " happily ever after " it keeps stumbling over some fairly fundamental points . the script by richard lagravenese has its share of tart one-liners , but it is awfully talky . mirror's one entertaining scene of physical comedy , in which rose tries gamely to seduce gregory , comes quite late in the game , by which time it has become clear that its two hour plus running time was doing the story no favors . streisand may have wanted a lush romantic fairy tale full of marvin hamlisch strings and doe-eyed conversations , but she sacrificed a lean , sharp comedy in the process . she also doesn't use that extra time to establish how much alike rose and gregory are in their romanticism ; if bridges makes one big mistake in his performance , it is making gregory's rationalizations for his behavior sound too pat . streisand may be nobody's idea of a conventional beauty , but her boudoir-photograph style close-ups throughout the film tend to work against the baggy sweaters and frumpy demeanor ; when she finally goes for full-on glamour late in the film , it is less a metamorphosis than a relief . many viewers may find her character too far-fetched to swallow , much as they had problems with janeane garofolo as the " ugly one " in the truth about cats & dogs , but i'm not convinced that is the problem . the mirror has two faces is reminiscent of hollywood film-making when the star was always filmed , like claudette colbert , with only her best side to the camera , and it is pleasant enough in its retro sort of way . the smiles rarely turn into laughs , however , and streisand's notorious attention to detail has somehow caused her to miss the big picture : at some point , this romance needed to set off a spark . the mirror has two faces doesn't quite have that fire , substituting a warm , soft lamp placed strategically behind streisand's hair . 
mpaa rating : pg ( mild profanity ) running time : 121 minutes . it won't be difficult for many viewers to accept denzel washington as a character sent straight from heaven . . . particularly female viewers . washington has been a regular on " sexiest man " lists , dazzling audiences with his confident smile while building an impressive body of work in roles characterized by intensity , integrity and -- frequently -- inscrutability . yet for all his obvious talent and good looks , he has often seemed unapproachable on screen , so cool that he fails to be warm . the preacher's wife comes as a welcome addition to washington's resume , a somewhat predictable holiday confection buoyed by washington's engaging lead performance . it is equally natural to expect a certain amount of holy-rolling in such an effort , but the preacher's wife does a fairly good job of walking the fine line between sincere and sanctimonious . penny marshall ( big , awakenings ) has shown herself to be that rare contemporary director who can make a " feel-good " film which doesn't leave you feeling insulted , and she generally avoids saccharine overload . the major problem with the preacher's wife is the same problem which has characterized most of marshall's films : it's just too long . her movies have a tendency to run out of gas with a lot of film left to run , and the preacher's wife could have benefited from plenty of additional editing . much of it could have come from whitney houston's performance , which consists largely of finding reasons to break into song like elvis presley in one of his carefully crafted vehicles . houston certainly has a spectacular voice , and it is nice to hear her using it for gospel standards rather than dreary ballads , but half a dozen musical numbers simply pushes the limit and pads the running time . little justin pierre edmond should have been another strong candidate for the editor's knife ; the button-cute rascal is one of the worst child actors i have seen on screen in years . thankfully , denzel washington is on hand to provide a jolt whenever the preacher's wife needs it most . his first appearance may be a shock to those who know him best as serious , determined characters in films like malcolm x , crimson tide and courage under fire : dropped from the sky into the snow , looking decidedly dapper in a grey suit , hat and topcoat , washington's dudley proceeds to celebrate his return to corporeal form by spinning around on the ground like one of the three stooges . his innocence and earnestness are thoroughly charming , and his scenes with courtney b . vance ( effective as the real principal character of the story ) have a particular appeal . if there isn't much chemistry between washington and houston , well , that's not really the point of the preacher's wife . besides , denzel washington is a chemical reaction all by himself , and it is a pleasure to see that he can sparkle as well as he smolders . 
it has been a long time since a film inspired as profound a case of " what am i missing ? " in me as shine . this australian drama has been a fixture on year-end top ten lists , won a best picture nod from the national board of review , and picked up a new york film critics association best actor for star geoffrey rush . so i sat myself down to watch shine , and i waited to be transported . and i waited . and i waited . and it never happened . shine is an extremely well-crafted film , but it doesn't pay off at a gut level . director scott hicks' restrained approach to an uplifting story ends up choking much of the life out of it . perhaps the film's best sequence involves david's performance of the " rach 3 " at the albert hall , wild hair and sweat flying in slow motion as his ultimate artistic triumph becomes a mute pounding of keys . even the death of one character cannot evoke much emotional response , and david's match with gillian is apparently the result of complementary astrological charts instead of a genuine connection between them . shine may be about david helfgott , but peter helfgott is the real soul of the film , and when he disappears from the narrative there is nothing to drive it forward . geoffrey rush's performance as the adult david is superb , a portrait of mental illness which is vivid and lacking the obtrusive kookiness of many screen depictions of such conditions ; his mile-a-minute monologues full of puns and streams of consciousness display a brilliant mind imploding upon itself . there simply isn't much to the second half of shine which leads us to a conclusion . hicks' background is in documentary film-making , and it seems that his instinct is to let david's story tell itself . most films about characters struggling to triumph over adversity play to the broadest possible emotional canvas , and it is admirable that hicks has chosen not to bludgeon his audience insensible with feel-good signifiers . shine is a good-looking , good-sounding and thoroughly professional production with a pair of excellent performances by armin mueller-stahl and geoffrey rush . it is also too sedate by half , a story of shattered genius which opts for a dim glow when it needs a dazzling shine . 
screenplay : alan parker , oliver stone . director : alan parker . mpaa rating : pg ( adult themes , mild profanity ) running time : 135 minutes . there aren't too many directors in the last thirty years who have directed one live-action musical ; alan parker has directed two ( bugsy malone and pink floyd the wall ) , and the latter was probably the last through-sung english-language film . well , one of them fulfilled the promise , anyway . parker has made evita a compelling visual spectacle , but his leading lady doesn't provide the same vibrant quality , even though it seems she is trying desperately to do so . one of the reasons andrew lloyd webber's musicals have been so successful is that they combine the appeal of grand opera with an accessible pop sensibility , and it would seem difficult to capture that operatic feel in a film . alan parker , however , has exactly the visual style required for a production like evita . the funeral scenes which open the film have an impressive scope , captured in mournful tones by cinematographer darius khondji ( seven ) , and there is a flow between scenes which is both theatrical and cinematic . evita is a story told almost entirely through the songs , and parker doesn't add any radical new interpretations with his direction . there are a few changes to the material , notably the addition of the new webber/tim rice composition " you must love me " which could have been dropped into any disney animated musical and been just as suitable , but other changes are more interesting and effective . some exciting arrangements also give new kick to webber's tunes . " buenos aires " gets a swirl of percussion to match eva's drive , and " i'd be surprisingly good for you " has a seductive swing . certain songs do have a dated , jangly 70s guitar sound , but the characteristic infectious bombast of webber's compositions holds up surprisingly well . what works far less well is the presentation of the film's three central -- and , for all practical purposes , only -- characters . antonio banderas brings his appealing swagger to che , as well as a voice which compensates for a weak lower range with some sweet high notes . che is the voice of eva's critics , yet he isn't a complete character , and neither is juan peron . that leaves madonna to carry the dramatic weight of evita , and it is plenty clear that she is eager to prove she can handle it . madonna understands determination , and she can convey it ; charisma is another story . you can't act a magnetic personality , and madonna is left to play benevolence without the force of will which makes her uncertain motives intriguing . the irony is that , for someone who has made a career of not caring about how people perceive her , madonna seems to want too much to be liked and respected as an actress . her evita lacks mystery , making alan parker's film a sweeping piece of visual theater with a star who wants to step into the audience and thank everyone for coming . 
mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , mild profanity ) . running time : 85 minutes . the strange re-release patterns inspired by chan's sudden american popularity has made it nearly impossible to make any sense of the police story chronology , if making sense of things like this matter to you . first strike itself makes only a rudimentary kind of sense , but chan's hair-raising stunts and affable demeanor rarely require much set-up to be enjoyable . a chase sequence involving gun-toting skiers is straight out of for your eyes only ; the underwater battles in a shark tank with oxygen the most prized possession is vintage thunderball . the scenery shifts from hong kong to the ukraine to australia , serving up a few sacrificial vehicles ( helicopters , a funeral carriage ) for big-time explosions . throw in a saul bass opening credits sequence and a vodka martini and you might think 007 had become a celibate asian . unfortunately , while first strike is the grandest of chan's american releases , it is also the least charming , for most of the same reasons . jackie chan films don't work because of large scale set pieces ; they work because chan himself is extremely personable and because his unmatched fight choreography can make you giddy with pleasure . the moments when chan gets to show his stuff up close are wonderful -- he flips through windows as though he were made of paper , dances across rooftops , uses an inflatable pool toy to walk quite literally on water . the extended sequence where he takes on four men by turning a broom , papier mache dragon heads and an eight foot ladder into weapons is one of the most spectacular hand-to-hand combat sequences i have ever seen on screen , a combination of martial arts and acrobatics edited with astonishing fluidity . while the more elaborate bits fall flat with ho-hum familiarity , the seven minutes of that one fight sequence make first strike worth seeing . the very end of that sequence may be just as indicative of what makes a jackie chan action film unique . as superhuman as chan can be on screen , he is also quite human in his persona . he doesn't endear himself to the audience by tossing off dreary one-liners ; he simply plays a guy , sometimes silly and sometimes embarrassed , who happens to be able to defy gravity . jackie chan's first strike is a terminally dopey spy thriller with anyone else in the lead role . jackie chan alone is enough to make the thought of first strike 2 -- or is that supercop 3 , or police story 5 ? -- somewhat appealing . 
screenplay : jonathan brett . producers : martin ransohoff , david valdes . director : robert butler . mpaa rating : r ( violence , strong profanity , adult themes ) running time : 103 minutes . turbulence is an interesting case of the kind of baby steps hollywood takes when it comes to making women equal players in the movie business . with turbulence we finally get an entry in the well-worn " terror in a confined space " genre which features a woman as the central protagonist -- not just as a ready-for-kidnapping love interest -- and she can't even get first billing ahead of ray liotta . of course lauren holly is hardly a familiar face or name , which begs the question of why she received such a plum role . that is only one of the places turbulence , a thriller with unique and sometimes compelling rhythms , misses its chance to be something special . the opening minutes of turbulence make it clear that scripter jonathan brett and director robert butler are in full " cut to the chase " mode . our knowledge of teri as a character consists of the fact that her fiancee just dumped her , which in turn is infinitely more than we know about any other character on the plane . butler gives much of the first half of turbulence an effective tension ; the atmosphere is surprisingly creepy , with lightning and christmas tree lights turning the central confrontation between teri and weaver into something more unsettling than the pedestrian script could muster on its own . it is a casually seductive portrayal by liotta , and sets up a scenario where the hero will have to outsmart the intelligent antagonist , since as a woman it is less likely that she will be able to overpower him physically . unfortunately , we already know from the idiotically revelatory ad campaign not only that weaver is in fact guilty as charged , but also that he is going to turn into a bug-eyed , tongue-waggling loon . liotta tramples the mid-air scenery swigging champagne from the bottle , swinging an axe around , tossing off glib quips and generally doing his best audition for the role of the joker if the batman series decides to revive him and nicholson is unavailable . so much for a battle of the minds . it is a strange decision for many reasons , but primarily because the film spends so much time establishing how bright teri is . lauren holly's performance doesn't contribute all that much to that perception ; she's feisty enough , but she seems to be going through the motions when the script gives her a shot at weaver , and it is hard not to be reminded of julie haggerty's thin-voiced flight attendant from airplane ! those scenes , far longer and more technical than you might expect , could have anxious action fans fidgeting in their seats , but the simple competence of cross's tones give them a steady , gripping tempo . rachel ticotin is similarly strong in the similarly miniscule role of an air traffic controller , radiating the kind of intelligence the role of teri really needs . in fact , if turbulence was going to give us a female hero , it could have gone the extra step and given us one as strong as ticotin . go one step still further and make cross the sly , seductive villain , and you really could have had something . turbulence may be a better than average adrenaline shot , but it's still basically business as usual , even with no arnold or sly or jean-claude . 
mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 104 minutes . albert brooks is a rather odd case as a film-maker . on the one hand , he goes years between projects , has loyal and generally intelligent fans and never has had a really big commercial success . brooks is like a hybrid of woody allen and ivan reitman , a writer/director too smart and eccentric to get maximum mileage out of his marketing-friendly plots . mother is a perfect example of brooks' nose for high-concept , but for once he doesn't work any particular magic with it . riding on the familiarity of his situations and a wicked performance by debbie reynolds , brooks turns out an amusing but uneven domestic comedy . john determines that all of his failed relationships have had certain elements in common , and that those elements might be traceable to his upbringing . much of the appeal of mother -- most of the appeal , to be frank -- comes from the character of beatrice henderson , less as created by brooks than as realized by reynolds . there are moments when brooks verges on condescension towards his older female characters -- an encounter with neighbors in a grocery store is both funny and rather embarrassing -- but debbie reynolds salvages every one by giving her line readings an intelligent twist . even when beatrice is fumbling with technology or circling a parking lot past the one available space , she never comes off as dim or pathetic . with a professionalism showing no signs of rust after a long layoff from screen acting , reynolds wrestles a laundry list of motherly quirks into a wonderful character . this achievement comes almost in spite of brooks' script , which has plenty of funny lines but too little narrative direction . the goodwill generated by the main premise carries mother a surprisingly long way , but brooks doesn't do all that much with it . the film is full of situations with great comic potential , most of which inspire a chuckle and little more because brooks prefers wry observation to outrageousness . it is a scene which primes you for a huge laugh -- a man , his mother , lingerie . . . can you feel the giddy tension rising ? -- then dissolves after yet another good-natured chuckle . mother is full of moments , like a scene where john channel-surfs through a succession of info-mercials , where brooks seems to be waiting for a punch line to formulate itself instead of attacking the set-up to provide a payoff . mother is almost always an entertaining film , but it is not nearly as subversive as it could have been , or as flirting with disaster was covering similar ground of warped familial relations . perhaps the problem is that the script does not launch itself from full , rich characterizations . in fact , as the story unfolds , it seems that brooks has constructed his story around psychological case studies rather than people . every time mother does something exasperating , john deconstructs it in search of its deeper significance . the result is frustrating , as though brooks were telling jokes then stopping after each one to explain why it was just as sad as it was funny . it is one of the characteristics which makes brooks unique as a film-maker that he builds his climax around a moment of insight rather than a wacky car chase , but there has to be a middle ground . debbie reynolds takes mother's high-concept and gives it high energy , making it a film anyone who has had a mother could like , but perhaps only a mother could love . 
director : richard linklater . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , brief nudity ) running time : 118 minutes . no two sensibilities could be more dissimilar -- bogosian the high-energy easterner and linklater the laid-back texan -- even when addressing similar subject matter . suburbia is a frequently compelling film , but there is a terribly fragmented feel to it . while linklater's natural affection for his characters' generational anxieties gives the story much of its charm , he frequently finds himself fighting with a writer who seems to despise those characters . linklater films it almost as one uninterrupted drive-by take , a numbing panorama of monotony representing a world which seems designed to destroy imagination , and it suggests that the director's rage , such as it is , is directed at the place rather than at the people . bogosian , on the other hand , is far less forgiving . while sooze plays at addressing " issues " she knows nothing about and jeff strips naked in an expression of divine apathy , bogosian can only shake his head at them through the words of nazeer : " you people are so stupid . the schism between the perspectives of linklater and bogosian makes suburbia a film of mixed messages , but it is still worth watching thanks to the talented cast members and some individual moments of genuine clarity . the echoes of glover call to mind another film about disaffected youth , 1986's river's edge , but suburbia is wittier and not nearly as bleak . though you may find yourself wondering why these characters would have been high school friends , the interaction between them is almost always interesting enough to hold your attention . the problem is that , while your attention is held on those characters , you can't get a handle on what you are supposed to think about them . critics of films about generation x-ers often repeat the criticisms of real-life generation x-ers , that they are merely whining children of privilege who have never had to struggle for anything in their lives . suburbia would have been a more powerful film if between them they had chosen one object of scorn : suburbanites , or suburbia itself . 
screenplay : david lynch and barry gifford . director : david lynch . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , nudity , violence , profanity ) running time : 134 minutes . please don't bother asking me what lost highway is " about , " because i have only the vaguest idea . i'm also not particularly bothered by that fact , any more than i am bothered by not knowing what a bosch painting or a given chapter in " ulysses " is " about . " a linear narrative is not a pre-requisite for the evocation of an emotional response , and david lynch is one of the few artists who has tried to push the limits of cinema as a medium of sound , images and possibilities . lost highway is lynch at his best and his worst , as unnerving as it is excessive . any attempt to describe the plot of lost highway is ultimately an exercise in futility , but essentially it involves two uniquely connected story-lines . there is little doubt in my mind that , when he is working at the top of his form , david lynch can turn our darkest unspoken fears into brilliant cinema like no other living director . there are nightmare visions in lynch projects which can leave you shaking for days , and there are moments during the first hour of lost highway which build and release tension with an almost unbearable skill . long stretches of silence are punctuated by sudden bursts of sound ; characters drift into darkness in shots that linger long enough to make you start peeking through your fingers . with its eerie production design and slowly mounting paranoia , lost highway begins to cast a spell which will have viewers anxious but intrigued . too bad it takes such a short time to lose those viewers entirely . the fred-to-pete transformation is not a fatal error in and of itself , though audiences used to conventional narratives may be baffled by it . the real villain in the collapse of lost highway is lynch's inability to ground the film so that its world makes internal sense . eraserhead's landscape was unquestionably surreal ; blue velvet , as unsettling as it was , always focused on the horrors of the real world . the mistake in lost highway isn't the outrageous character shift , but the way the other characters in the film respond to that event as a problem to be solved . if lost highway is about psychosis made flesh , about psychological duality becoming physical duality , it falls short of pulling you into that world because it has given you the impression that there is an " answer . " and while you're busy giving yourself a headache trying to solve that mystery , you aren't getting caught up in the atmosphere of the mystery itself . lost highway contains too many individual moments of vintage lynch to be considered a failure . the grimly comic violence , the degraded sexuality and the languid exchanges of dialogue are all familiar , and seem more like self-plagiarism than a characteristic style . lynch often seems more interested in re-creating than creating , in taking the perfect 10's of his career and cranking them up to 11 . for its first hour , lost highway is brilliant , and there are flashes of that brilliance for another 75 minutes , but they don't hold together because there isn't a consistent tone or structure to sustain them . in a film where everything seems to be in two places at once , it is fitting that lost highway doesn't stay in any one place long enough . 
screenplay : lawrence kasdan and george lucas . director : richard marquand . mpaa rating : pg ( violence ) running time : 130 minutes . i'll admit that i was surprised when i heard of plans for the special edition of star wars , and not because i thought of the original film as inviolate . i just wasn't sure why george lucas would feel the need to make star wars " the way ( he ) really wanted to make it , " since it seemed as though he had already done it . yes , i know lucas didn't direct jedi -- the way steven spielberg didn't direct poltergeist -- but it was clearly an amped-up version of the original film , with all the things lucas couldn't do the first time around . the climactic dog-fight was more complex , the destruction of the death star more spectacular . . . even jabba the hutt finally made it on-screen . the introduction of the cuddly , teddy-bear primitives called the ewoks has long been reviled by star wars aficionados as an obvious bow to commercial interests , but they were only the most obvious example . -- and many moments of comic relief were so utterly goofy that it was had to imagine they weren't designed for an audience under 12 . in my comments on the star wars : special edition , i noted that the original film never could have worked if lucas had been aware of the merchandising potential , because its innocence would have been compromised . return of the jedi , i think , is proof of that . that doesn't make jedi a bad film ; it would take a concerted effort for one mediocre film to spoil the goodwill of two great ones . the speeder bike chase on endor is tremendously impressive , a dizzying piece of action film-making which still out-classes most of the attempts at chases scenes you'll see in contemporary films . there are plenty of satisfying moments in return of the jedi , even if most of them come from the pleasure of visiting once again with old friends . if there is anything the special edition emphasizes , however , it is that jedi is much longer than it needs to be . among the new scenes are a re-tooled version of the musical number performed by sy snootles in jabba's lair -- the once-puppeteered snootles is now a computer-generated snootles -- is a ridiculous piece of technical flash which looks like it belongs in a 3-d feature at disneyland . worse still , it slows down a film which got repetitive even in its original incarnation . just call me darth vader jr . by the time vader has his moment of redemption , revealing himself to be something resembling ray milland in pancake makeup , the effect is undercut by a desire just to see the whole thing wrapped up already . when one of those scenes shows a massive statue being toppled , it's hard not to think of lucas turning the star wars trilogy into a grand metaphor for the defeat of communism , with the galaxy made safe once again for private enterprise . the film industry was certainly made safe for private enterprise after the massive success of the star wars films . 
screenplay : theodore witcher . director : theodore witcher . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , brief nudity ) running time : 105 minutes . theodore witcher's love jones won the audience award at the 1997 sundance film festival , which lately seems to be more of a general message on the state of cinema than a comment on a specific film . last year's winner , the spitfire grill , was a maudlin contraption which was laudable for being a thoroughly decent redemption story . in the case of love jones , the audience award may have been sending a similar message about what they'd like to see more of . african-americans in the movies have been either clowns , criminals or police captains so often in recent years that love jones -- a low-key comedy-drama about educated black artists -- was bound to strike a responsive chord . i can't help but wonder whether the sundance audience was rewarding love jones itself or the idea of a film _like_ love jones . make no mistake , witcher's sophisticated romantic tale is exceptionally well-crafted and includes some appealing moments , but the script is sometimes lazy and not particularly interesting . it's a film with better intentions than results . it is fairly incidental to the story that these characters happen to be african-americans , yet that doesn't mean that the film is color-blind , or that the characters talk like they just walked out of eton . the scenes between darius and his friends -- savon ( isaiah washington ) , hollywood ( bill bellamy ) and sheila ( bernadette l . clark ) -- have a low-key energy , sparked by the wit of their ritualized insults . the dialogue feels natural and authentic , and the performances are characterized by a convincing sense of familiarity which makes them even stronger collectively than individually . if love jones had been a film about these characters just sitting around talking , i probably would have enjoyed it much more . the problem is that the plot _is_ essentially a re-hash of when harry met sally , with relationships not nearly as compelling or funny . darryl jones contributes a wonderfully jazzy score , but that score infuses love jones with a languid pace , the effect of which is to make you as nonchalant about the fate of darius and nina's romance as they seem to be themselves . there is plenty of chemistry between larenz tate and nia long ; there's just not enough drama . their relationship seems just fine " just kickin' it . " that casual quality sometimes seeps into witcher's plotting . threads of sub-plots drift through love jones at regular intervals , and witcher never seems interested in explaining them in any detail . the large supporting cast consists of faces and voices which don't develop into full-fledged people . they are more like background notes in a tone poem . love jones is the kind of film i would like to encourage , but i find it hard to recommend it enthusiastically . it's respectable , it's admirable , it's smooth and smart and professional . it's just not particularly enjoyable . audiences have been jonesing for characters like those in love jones , but they may be able to work up no more than a like jones for this film . 
i suppose one could find some sociological significance to the glut of recent films about inattentive parents and neglected children , if one were inclined to give a cliche a more grandiose label . from whoopi goldberg in bogus to arnold schwarzenegger in jingle all the way , from tim allen in the santa clause to tim allen in jungle2jungle , the reformed workaholic has become the most popular protagonist in formula comedies , going through a series of wacky adventures before giving a big hug to a sad-eyed son or daughter . jim carrey is the latest star to step into this vehicle , and he certainly has enough pure manic energy to give is some spark , but he has to work awfully hard to do it . liar liar is a pure show-off showcase for carrey , and by sheer force of will he makes it funny , despite a ridiculously limp script which has only one place to go . i have this theory that the script for liar liar , credited to paul guay and stephen mazur , consisted largely of parenthetical gaps which read something like " jim does some weird physical stuff here " or " jim makes a goofy face . " there is a staggering lack of creativity in liar liar given the possibilities of the premise . carrey is trapped in one situation -- the courtroom -- for far too long , and that situation begins to look like an extended homage to steve martin's work in all of me , but without martin's ability to maintain his dignity . the dialogue consists largely of one fairly obvious put-downs after another , most of which are salvaged by carrey's priceless reaction takes and his futile attempts to control his honesty . it seems fairly evident that without carrey , liar liar would have been an utter catastrophe . with him , it manages some genuine comic high notes . carrey seems to realize that the entire film is riding on his shoulders , and he plays it that way , as though the other people in the film were scenery to be swallowed or knocked out of the way . for all practical purposes they are , particularly in the aforementioned partners' meeting , where a dozen people sit around a table for the express purpose of being skewered ; carrey often seems to be performing for the rest of the cast as well as for the audience . only cary elwes , in a subtle turn as audrey's painfully earnest boyfriend , lends any support at all . as long as carrey remains in overdrive , liar liar provides fairly consistent moderate laughs -- as well as a few big ones -- but the entire enterprise feels compromised by the tired paternal redemption motif . it almost spoils the fun of watching carrey do his best impression of a human pinball , knowing that eventually he's going to have to break down in a tearful proclamation of devotion to his son . it's too bad that , with carrey on board and a fanciful concept at the ready , liar liar can't work up an inspired story to match carrey's inspired performance . in fact , it can barely work up enough material to fill 90 minutes , resorting to end-credit out-takes to pad the running time . she may be right , but thank heaven someone involved in liar liar was working as hard as all these single-minded screen parents we've been seeing lately . 
screenplay : christopher reed and cynthia carle . director : randall miller . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , mild sexual content ) running time : 105 minutes . i wasn't sure i would be able to enjoy the 6th man as a wacky comedy , given the uncomfortable familiarity of the plot . gathers' death affected me as profoundly as any celebrity tragedy ever has , and i cringed at the idea of that event being turned into a source of supernatural hijinks . perhaps that's why i was so pleasantly surprised to discover how much heart the 6th man turned out to have . though slapstick is definitely part of the mix , there is a genuinely affecting human story at the core of this film which outweighs its occasional clumsiness . the 6th man is a fantasy of course , but close followers of pac-10 basketball will appreciate that it's not just the presence of ghostly activity which makes the film fantastic . not only are washington and stanford in this film's final four , but dismissed head coaches todd bozeman of california and jim harrick of ucla are still sitting on their respective teams' benches in game footage ; if that doesn't qualify as fantasy , i'm not sure what does . the 6th man is certainly targeted at college basketball fans given its release during final four weekend , but the on-court action is often awkwardly photographed with too many close-ups and choppy editing . for a film about college basketball , the 6th man generally doesn't try very hard to re-create the fan excitement or game situations of the sport . it's a comedy , and occasionally it's a very funny one . marlon wayans turns in an extremely entertaining and energetic physical performance as kenny , who has to do a lot of solo acting as though he is being hassled by his invisible older brother -- hugs , head-locks , wrestling matches and other practical jokes . it's fun , if somewhat predictable stuff , mostly because wayans is able to sell it with enthusiasm . fortunately , the 6th man is actually more enjoyable when it's not a comedy . some of the character material is unnecessary -- notably the attempt at a romantic relationship between kenny and r . c . ( yes , michael michele is a woman ) -- but the sibling story-line is extremely effective . the interaction between the two brothers , squabbles and all , is what makes the 6th man more than the formulaic disney silliness you might expect . in spite of some erratic pacing and uneven comedy , the 6th man has the emotional content to give a tragedy the weight it deserves , as well as the entertainment it needs . 
screenplay : greg mottola . producers : nancy tenenbaum and steven soderbergh . director : greg mottola . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 88 minutes . there is a quality to certain independent films which i have referred to in the past as an " oppressive quirkiness . " as frustrating as it can be to watch a hollywood release which is a non-stop monotone of plot or action , it is similarly frustrating when a film-maker's infatuation with colorful characters at the expense of narrative results in all those colors blurring into a dull brown . actors understandably love playing those characters , but independent writer-directors -- frequently rookie auteurs -- can't always tame their creations into a solid story . greg mottola's the daytrippers is characterized by a quirkiness more pervasive than oppressive , and some of it is quite entertaining . by the time it's all over , however , you may find yourself wondering what the point of it all was . for well over half of the daytrippers , the character riffs provide a lot of laughs without becoming repetitive or abrasive . liev schreiber has the most subtly amusing role , an intellectual would-be author who bashes middle class obliviousness even as he sucks up to the obliviously middle class rita . anne meara and pat mcnamara play the bickering parents with interesting shadings on stereotypical characterizations , and parker posey again shows off her indie-queen charm . mottola puts them in a variety of bizarre situations , including what posey aptly describes as " the shortest car chase in history , " and peppers the film with memorable minor roles like marcia gay harden's turn as a drunken party-goer trying to deal with the presence of an ex-boyfriend at the party . as the story plays out , eliza's positioning in that sane center proves to be one of the daytrippers' most glaring problems . it may be part of mottola's vision for eliza that she is too passive , yet the result is that we don't understand enough about who eliza is or how she feels about her life . we see that rita has manipulated her daughters' relationships in a thinly disguised disdain for their value as individuals , and that should guide us to an awakening in eliza . instead , we get an abrupt emotional response and an even more abrupt conclusion to the film , hard on the heels of a revelation which feels more self-consciously clever than appropriate for the rest of the film . on an even more fundamental level , the daytrippers loses its audience because it loses its sense of humor . after sixty minutes worth of appealing wit , mottola perhaps falls victim to a concern that his film will be considered too frivolous . the daytrippers has a lot of good-natured humor to recommend it , but i'm not sure greg mottola really knew what he wanted to do with the lively characters he had created . he may have learned one lesson of independent film-making the hard way : it's a good start to put a bunch of interesting characters together in a vehicle and set them on their way , but sooner or later that vehicle has to come to a destination . the daytrippers is an entertaining ride while that vehicle is in motion .

" instead of getting a brassy broad starring in a brassy broad farce , viewers will find a surprisingly mellow comedy starring someone named paula marshall . it is only because marshall is so charming that that old feeling doesn't fall flat on its mellowness . dan and lilly's divorce was anything but amicable , and the expected shouting match causes quite a spectacle at the reception . the first half-hour certainly fosters the expectation that that old feeling is going to be a tart-tongued parade of family quarrels , exaggerated characters and physical comedy . the opening scene trots out the familiar " woman swallows her surprise engagement ring in a desert " scenario ( seen most recently in woody allen's everyone says i love you ) , but it is still goofy fun . the wedding gives the sniping dan and lilly some clever insults , and also introduces the one-dimensional characters of their second spouses . david rasche is particularly funny as the incessantly jargon-spewing touchy-feely therapist , who talks himself hoarse and makes terribly sincere pronouncements about how important it is " to dialogue and to language . " director carl reiner keeps all these elements under control , never allowing scenes to degenerate into pie fights or prat-falls , while still keeping that old feeling lively and sharp-witted . that sharp wit is dulled , however , once dan and lilly run off together , drastically reducing the level of comedic tension and shifting the focus to molly's quest for her parents and for her own romantic happiness . that old feeling needs to lay more foundation for their incompatibility -- more early scenes of molly's playful streak , more sense of keith's stuffy careerism and hypocrisy -- so that we understand the story is really going to be about molly . as it stands , that old feeling often seems disjointed . there is too little conflict for too much of that old feeling as we wait for molly to make her choice between keith and joey . thank heavens paula marshall is such a find . she is the kind of actress who seems to be comfortable in any kind of scene , combining an intelligent sexiness with a willingness to look completely silly ; the single funniest moment in that old feeling may be a depressed molly drowning her sorrows in a mouthful of spray whipping cream . there are some very nice scenes between marshall and danny nucci , whose photographer begins as a supreme annoyance but gradually develops an adorably scruffy puppy-dog quality , and molly's romantic dilemma becomes interesting only because marshall makes her such a flustered sweetheart . if you find yourself entertained by that old feeling , it may not be in the way you expect , or by whom you expect . 
screenplay : hans bauer and jim cash & jack epps jr . producers : verna harrah , leonard rabinowitz and carole little . director : luis llosa . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , profanity ) running time : 92 minutes . if you have never had the opportunity to read the press notes for a hollywood film , you are missing an art form with more inspired comedy than most of what they put on the screen . i'm not saying the humor is intentional . take anaconda , for instance , about which co-star kari wuhrer opines in the press notes : " there is a subtle message in this film . . . ( about ) you only wish you could see her try to say that with a straight face , to see what _really_ good acting is . there are plenty of words one could use to describe anaconda , but " subtle " ain't one of them . b-movies don't get much b-movie-er than this one , which doesn't mean it's a bad film . on its own level -- thanks to some hilariously ghoulish special effects -- it's actually something of a guilty pleasure . i offer a warning here that some of the following information might be considered spoilers , assuming you have been hermetically sealed away from pop culture and have never seen a suspense film . anaconda doesn't work very hard to buck the conventions of the genre ; in fact , it seems to revel in them . as one might expect , characters die . as one might also expect , they generally die in inverse order of their placement in the credits . anaconda even steals a page from 1980s slasher films by giving a monster a taste for those with questionable moral fiber . shoot a monkey ? the script serves up stock characters like the pompous prima donna westridge and the villainous poacher sarone with a giddy disregard for anything but plot , plot and more plot . not that the plot makes much sense ( beginning with why the narrator is along on the shoot in the first place ) , or even moves very briskly for a suspense thriller . director luis llosa ( the specialist ) often can't seem to decide whether anaconda is about the conflict with the snake or the conflict with sarone , and it proves to be a mistake to focus on the shipboard clashes when it means the characters are going to have to talk for any length of time . voight , whose perpetual sneer and absurd paraguayan accent make pacino's performance in scarface look positively subdued , goes madly over the top and looks like he's the only person having any fun . at least eric stoltz had the good sense to grab his check and spend half the film in a coma . so why , then , is anaconda more fun than glorified b-movies like twister or independence day ? because it never pretends to be anything more , and because it includes the kind of scenes a good monster movie needs : moments which leave you laughing even as you are going " eeewwwww . " sometimes a film only needs one really memorable scene to leave you feeling a goofy sense of satisfaction . anaconda boasts at least three , including a shot from inside the snake's digestive system ( the ana-colon-cam ? ) and it doesn't even matter that the computer-generated snake is nobody's idea of state-of-the-art visual effects work . a b-movie shouldn't be out to impress you . anaconda is simplistic , and could have used more of its monster , but it delivers . i'll look for my " subtle messages " in movies that aren't about 40-foot-long killer snakes . 
screenplay : jerome armstrong and billy ray . producers : neal h . moritz and andrew z . davis . director : mick jackson . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 103 minutes . it's hard to believe it has been over two and a half months since the last volcano movie hit north american screens ; it seems like only , gosh , seven or eight weeks . 20th century fox is banking on the fact that lava's lovelier the second time around , rolling out volcano as an april preview to the summer movie season , but whether or not it works depends on what you're looking for in your disaster movies . dante's peak was frequently dumb and predictable , but it also delivered suspense down the stretch in well-packaged bursts . volcano is less chained to convention , a bit more clever , and boasts a more talented cast . it is also more about spectacle than suspense , a very impressive production which is easier to enjoy from a detached distance than it is to get caught up in . there are certain elements you have come to expect in a film of this kind , and volcano delivers all of them : intransigent bureaucrats who end up making a bad situation worse , a hero whose personal life is given equal footing with large-scale destruction , pets which make improbable escapes . fortunately , the script by jerome armstrong and billy ray offers a few variations on those themes along the way . the dialogue sometimes does get stilted and heavy-handed , and a few of the sub-plots -- including one involving a self-absorbed real estate developer ( john corbett ) -- are abandoned mid-stream without any fanfare . apparently someone realized that a fast pace and minimal exposition make for a better disaster . that doesn't prevent the writers from attempting some clumsy stabs at social commentary , which are notable largely because they are among the few attempts at making the film specific to l . a . as dopey as the tag line " the coast is toast " may be , it showed that the marketing people understood one of the more appealing elements of volcano's premise : people want to get a perverse charge out of watching tinseltown become tindertown . volcano could have used more of a sense of place , more recognizable landmarks like the angelyne billboard turned into briquets . sure , it's wonderful that racially-fragmented los angelenos become one big ashen can't-we-all-just-get-along family when forced to work together for the common weal , but be honest . wouldn't you rather see lava creeping up on a trademark l . a . traffic jam or chasing an army of suddenly less mellow in-line skaters through santa monica , instead of crawling like fluorescent tapioca down wilshire ? which is not to say that the fluorescent tapioca in question isn't extremely impressive . in fact , there are a lot of impressive visuals in volcano , including tactically launched lava bombs and a dizzying array of explosions . the pyrotechnicians earn every cent of their pay in volcano , but the imagery could have been accompanied by more tense set pieces . however , that's one of the rare moments when anyone seems to be in any genuine peril . i love l . a . , too , though i might have preferred it even more well-done . 
screenplay : luc besson and robert mark kamen . director : luc besson . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( brief nudity , sexual situations , violence , profanity ) running time : 127 minutes . here , i had thought to myself as i watched a television spot for the fifth element , may be the acme in hyperbolic idiocy . i could only shake my head , especially considering it had only been a few months since we had actually seen star wars for the 90s . then i saw the fifth element , and i was forced to acknowledge that , in a perverse way , the statement was completely accurate . like star wars , the fifth element is essentially a fairy tale , an archetypal good vs . and like many films of the 90s , it's so busy and loud that the compelling elements in the story tend to get lost . whatever else one might say about the fifth element , you have to give this to luc besson : there is nothing he won't try to keep the audience watching . the fifth element is a blitzkrieg of images , moods and messages which never lets up and never gives you a chance to get bored . you've got your good aliens , your bad aliens ( the shape-shifting mercenary mangalores ) , your sex ( enough to push the pg-13 envelope ) , your violence ( ditto ) and your romance , all tied up in a big shiny anti-war message before the finale . if that sounds like a lot to take in , that's only because it is . as undeniably entertaining as individual moments in the fifth element may be , the film never feels like a cohesive narrative with a distinctive sense of place . the most memorable creations of fantasy and science fiction , from the wizard of oz to brazil , created worlds which were not just unique but uniquely real -- every place , character and event were of a piece . besson doesn't create that kind of world , one where you feel transported to somewhere you've never been . there are plenty of vivid details in the fifth element , like dallas' one-room-does-all apartment and an airport filled with garbage , but they don't add up to anything truly intriguing . things happen for the sake of a momentary laugh or gasp rather than for the creation of the film's internal universe . it's not a specific future ; it's the future , impressive but generic . it's nice to have sly performers like willis , oldman and holm on hand to make the fifth element's relentlessness somehow forgivable . milla jovovich also does sharp work as leeloo , doing a riot grrl spin on daryl hannah in splash . indeed , there are enough of the right elements in the fifth element that you can't help but wish that they had been put together better . this is a story about heroes , villains and the battle between good and evil where the hero's quest is unclear , the real villain is given just enough personality to make one threatening phone call , and the climactic battle is over in a literal and figurative flash . the fifth element moves , all right , but it moves frantically , like the wired mugger who accosts dallas in one of the film's more amusing scenes . i kept thinking about how that character might have written the fifth element after an all night bender of jungian mythopoetics and the 23rd century upper-of-choice . 
producers : doug chapin and barry krost . director : joe mantello . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 115 minutes . in one sense , the premise for love ! valour ! compassion ! is sheer brilliance . the real inspiration comes not with the characters , however , but with the setting . by placing these characters in a world of their own , without a single heterosexual character around to define them by their " otherness , " mcnally allows us to focus on the problems of these people as human beings . in this place , they're just ordinary folks . the thing about ordinary folks is that they're not always particularly interesting . as sensitively written and well-acted as it may be , love ! valour ! compassion ! is terribly short on conflict . whenever mcnally does try to insert some conflict , it feels forced and inconsequential . valour ! compassion ! is spiced up by the presence of most bare male flesh ever seen in a movie not starring harvey keitel . the rest of the time , the characters sit around talking and supporting each other , waxing philosophical about love , romance , social politics and mortality until the film starts to feel very much like a gay big chill . whether that comparison intrigues you or makes you cringe may go a long way toward predicting your response to this film . the most affecting moments in love ! valour ! compassion ! both actors give solid , multi-faceted performances , bringing humor and delight to the connection between two people who have assumed that it's too late for them to experience love . all of the emotion in the film feels genuine , developed with care by a group of actors who , with the exception of alexander , originated the roles on broadway . it is a warm and appealing piece of film-making by first-time feature director joe mantello ( also an alum of the stage production ) , but that warmth is not enough to make it exceptional . it's not really a narrative so much as it is an idyll , a chance to watch normal people living normal lives in a pastoral setting . 
director : sidney lumet . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 115 minutes . it's just a terribly familiar one , one which lumet races through so quickly that it leaves little more than a blur of crooked cops and shattered naivete . one judge chuckles at sean's suggestion that a $500 bail for a poor black woman is too low ; another judge dozes off during an earnest summation . the day-to-day workings of the legal system may never have looked as mundane and depressing on film . that's all interesting stuff , but it's nothing particularly new . tv programs like " law & order " have turned the technicalities and small compromises of crime and punishment into effective drama without turning them into the stuff of morality plays . night falls on manhattan is about sean's fall from grace , which is both overly melodramatic and a bit disingenuous . sean's character might have made more sense if watching night falls on manhattan didn't feel like a drill from a speed-reading course . the unpredictable rhythms lumet injects in night falls on manhattan would be welcome of they didn't come at the expense of a well-developed protagonist . sean casey , for all his moral turmoil , is little more than a prop in a film so over-burdened with plot that he gets carried along in its wake . there are some interesting performances in night falls on manhattan , notably ron liebman's flamboyant work as the animated , angina-waiting-to-happen d . a . morgenstern , which make many individual scenes in the film worth watching . even those performances , however , are subjugated to the idea of the story . the rules are only there to be bent , lumet informs us . if he hadn't already told us the same thing before -- and better -- night falls on manhattan might have been a more engrossing experience . 
writer/director mark herman is so concerned about sounding the trumpet to deliver a " message " in brassed off that he almost ruins a perfectly good character study . brassed off is at its best painting a vivid portrait of life in a northern coal town . for the players , it is a social club which provides a rare opportunity to blow off steam , demonstrated in an amusing montage of ever-more-inebriated performances . if herman had kept his focus on this clash between pragmatism and idealism , best exemplified by the relationship between danny and phil ( an exceptional performance by stephen thompkinson ) , brassed off could have been a minor gem . unfortunately , herman is determined to make sure we leave the theater enlightened about the injustice of the pit closure program . like too many directors of films about social issues , herman doesn't trust our sympathy for the characters to create all the resonance the story needs . add an over-dramatized but under-developed romance between fitzgerald and ewan mcgregor ( as a young miner ) and you have a film which strays from its strengths . the human drama of brassed off makes for much sweeter music than strident sermonizing . 
screenplay : sara bernstein and gregory bernstein . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 98 minutes . on its face , director jonathan lynn's decision to make trial and error looks like a very , very bad one . sure , he had an unexpected success with a previous film about an inexperienced attorney fumbling around in a backwater courtroom ( my cousin vinny ) , but that was exactly the reason not to try it again . the subject matter is flimsy enough without trying to make it work _twice_ ; such hubris usually guarantees the wrath of the cinematic fates . yet trial and error somehow turns out to be another lightweight-but-agreeable comedy in the tradition of my cousin vinny , with just enough smiles and giggles to prove satisfying . it's hard to get terribly worked up over either the positive or negative qualities of trial and error . the comic situations offer consistent chuckles , as well as a fair number of missed opportunities . the casting presents appealing and talented performers like richards , daniels , torn and charlize theron ( sparkling with energy as a waitress who steals charlie's heart ) then gives them little to do . time and again trial and error will deliver a really satisfying moment , only to follow it up with an underwhelming one . it's actually to lynn's credit , however , that trial and error never seems like it's straining for every possible laugh . that's what you might have expected if the film had been set up as a star vehicle for richards ; the idea of liar liar with richards in the lead is primally disturbing . richards's role isn't far removed from " seinfeld's " kramer , providing the expected physical comedy and goofy reaction takes . as he contorts his body to simulate getting a kick to the ribs , you wonder whether richards can defy gravity to suit his comic purposes . yet daniels is never treated strictly as a second banana ; in fact , his romantic sub-plot may be the real heart of the film . the two gifted supporting actors do something fairly rare in screen buddy comedies : they actually support each other , rather than trying to step on each other . despite the effective pairing of richards and daniels , trial and error doesn't generate as many laughs as it should , particularly in the courtroom . richards' legend-in-his-own mind actor is a howl when he tries to translate the confrontational hyperbolics of fictional courtrooms to the real world , but that doesn't happen often enough . only at isolated moments , like during torn's sob-story testimony , does the script really seem to be providing a-level material . trial and error isn't a truly memorable comedy , but it's a well-paced and frequently amusing one . 
she didn't plan it that way -- you _can't_ plan it that way -- but pretty woman placed her in that rarefied stratum of film performers audiences will come to see on the strength of their names . for a couple of years , roberts tried to fight for her right to be a serious actress , taking less glamorous roles ( mary reilly ) or supporting roles ( michael collins , everyone says i love you ) for a-list directors , but the audience made its voice heard : " we want our pretty woman back . " in my best friend's wedding , roberts concedes to being a movie star once again . that premise sets the stage for some potentially outrageous comedy of the " all's fair in love and war " variety , but roberts never looks entirely comfortable with being outrageous . the interpretation of movie star-dom adopted by roberts , screenwriter ronald bass and director p . j . hogan ( muriel's wedding ) involves never being anything less than likeable , never doing anything which risks turning the audience against you . they don't understand that one of the perqs of being a movie star is that the audience is always ready to be on your side . it's no great revelation that there are only two possible outcomes in my best friend's wedding -- either julianne will triumph over an out-classed opponent , or she'll learn in important lesson and make a sacrifice . in either case , we're ready to be amused by her machinations before we get to that outcome ; we greet julianne's announcement that kimmy is " toast " with a chuckle of anticipation , not a sigh of disapproval . the reason my best friend's wedding isn't a better comedy , the reason it meanders but rarely soars , is that julianne's feeble efforts are about as likely to toast kimmy as a hot water bottle is to toast bread . bass's script is guided by the idea that julianne's hands should never get too dirty . roberts has some wonderful reaction shots in my best friend's wedding , but she reacts far more than she acts . in one of the film's most ironic lines , julianne apologizes to michael for all the " awful and not even terribly imaginative things " she has done . bass might have been better served coming up with more imaginative things rather than apologizing for the ones he came up with . surprisingly , my best friend's wedding is still fairly entertaining , thanks to a few unexpected bursts of irreverence . director hogan , who is turning into a prime candidate to direct a musical some day , continues his fascination with lip-synching to pop chestnuts , setting a slick opening credits sequence to " wishin' and hopin' " and turning a rehearsal dinner into an impromptu sing-along to " i say a little prayer . " the latter scene is a showcase for rupert everett , whose hilarious supporting work as george eliminates all fears of yet another " gay friend " character . his every moment on screen gives the film a jolt of comic energy , and proves that it is possible to be both devilish and thoroughly appealing . julia roberts could have learned a few things by studying his performance . if this is what she feared about movie star roles -- that they would require her merely to show up , smile and toss her hair -- she may have had good reason to be concerned . while my best friend's wedding is pretty amusing , roberts' return to being a pretty woman is pretty ordinary . 
screenplay : ed solomon , based on the comic book by lowell cunningham . producers : walter f . parkes and laurie macdonald . director : barry sonnenfeld . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , violence ) running time : 98 minutes . if batman & robin arrived as the summer film everyone was ready to hate , men in black arrived as the film everyone was ready to love . this was to be the antidote to a season filled with moribund sequels and lackluster high concepts , a cinematic life preserver for movie-goers drowning in over-promoted and under-developed bilge water blockbusters . it would bring together an appealing rising star , a savvy veteran character actor , an idiosyncratic director , a clever concept and fun visual effects . this , at last , would be something worth standing in line for . men in black the movie -- as opposed to men in black the much-anticipated event -- isn't worth standing in line for . it's a frisky , fairly enjoyable summer fantasy , one which avoids the common big-budget trap of over-staying its welcome . at the same time , it's a bit disappointing , and for an unexpected reason . men in black has been edited to the point where scenes collide awkwardly , where attempts at sub-plots cry out for more development . it's a film which actually _under_-stays its welcome . that says a lot for what is on the screen for just over 90 minutes . their responsibility is overseeing the earth's alien population -- alien , as in the extra-terrestrial kind -- as well as keeping the existence of those aliens secret from the general population . when director barry sonnenfeld plays that premise for its most outrageous and witty comic possibilities , men in black is a whole lot of fun . jones and smith have a solid rapport in a variation on the standard buddy-cop pairing , turning in performances which are knowing without winking too obviously at the audience . their supporting cast is sharp as well , particularly vincent d'onofrio in a hilarious turn as the sadistic alien bug who inhabits the skin of a redneck farmer ; d'onofrio's physical movements are even more hideously other-worldly than rick baker's make-up effects . the grandest , goofiest moments involve mib headquarters , rendered by bo welch's production design and eric brevig's visual effects as a cross between kennedy airport , ellis island and mos eisley spaceport . that wry charm , along with the collected talent in men in black , should have been enough to justify the hype . and so they might have been , if sonnenfeld had put together a film with a momentum to match its moments . the plot races from place to place so quickly that you're never given a chance to piece it together . as a collection of amusing individual scenes , men in black is just fine . it just never makes sense when precious minutes are devoted to half-hearted attempts at character development . it's not fair to call men in black unsatisfying , because there's a lot of great stuff in it . it does , however , feel unfinished ; it's great stuff not yet formed into a great movie . more to the point , it functions best as a set-up for -- oh bitter irony -- yet another big-budget summer sequel . only when compared to its current competition is it the summer masterpiece everyone was ready for it to be . calling a critic 'elitist' is like calling an accountant 'mathist .

picture perfect ( 20th century fox ) starring : jennifer aniston , jay mohr , kevin bacon , olympia dukakis , illeana douglas , kevin dunn . screenplay : arleen sorkin & paul slansky and glenn gordon caron . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , sexual situations ) running time : 105 minutes . mismatched buddy action comedy : hey , d . h . , i hear we may be getting a new arrival soon . die hard-in-a-confined-space thriller : i don't know , buddy , it feels pretty cramped around here as it is . buddy : well , this one definitely needs a break . d . h . : that's a mouthful . buddy : yeah , and she's been a busy little thing . can't buy me love , green card , pretty woman , housesitter . . . why , d . h . : sounds like young kate needs a mate , or at least the appearance of one . buddy : yes , well . . . anyway , miss aniston is fetching enough in the lead role , with that kind of frazzled charm sandra bullock turned into stardom . the script by arleen sorkin , paul slansky and glenn gordon caron has a few clever moments , and caron's direction is well-paced . what really makes it worth a look is an engaging , low-key performance by jay mohr as nick . it's uncommon to find an actor who can make earnestness interesting , or who can make an audience root for him by sheer force of his good nature , despite an under-written role . and we know that's not the only angle mohr can work , since he did a fine job of playing a completely slime in jerry maguire . d . h . : well , then , what's the problem ? buddy : the problem , as we both know , is that a script has to be better than that to keep audineces watching when you know exactly how the story is going to end . actually , everyone in picture perfect learns an important lesson along the way , undergoing an 11th hour conversion so that there isn't a single moderately unlikeable character remaining by the closing credits . only mohr seems like a genuinely decent person ; everyone else reads the lines of a genuinely decent person because the formula demands it . gritty , profane crime caper ( from the corner ) : hey , will you two shut the * &%$ up before i blow you the * &%$ away ? buddy : sorry . anyway , it's a cute enough little picture , but it strains that thin premise to its limits . she could certainly stand a few months here . d . h . : i have to agree with you there . buddy : you see , even though we seem completely different , i knew we had something in common all along . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : james mangold . director : james mangold . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , brief nudity ) running time : 103 minutes . at the age of 50 , sylvester stallone made a bold career move . after spending more than a decade making mega-millions for carrying flimsy films on his broad shoulders , stallone realized that he wasn't getting any younger . at the age of 50 , sylvester stallone decided to take up acting . in one sense , it was a brilliant decision . freddy heflin is easily stallone's best role since the one stallone wrote for himself 20 years ago -- one rocky balboa -- and stallone does some wonderful work with it . with minimal theatrics , stallone shows us a man who never wanted anything more than to be a cop finally deciding to be one of the good guys . with such solid potential in that story -- and such a talented cast of co-stars -- i'm sure the last thing stallone expected was that he would have to carry cop land the same way he carried his formula action films . yet that is exactly what he has to do , because mangold has written only one real character in cop land , and provided only one real conflict . even deniro gets little to work with and does even less with it , playing the short-fused i . a . man like every short-fused movie cop cliche rolled into one . only ray liotta , as a coke-addicted cop trying to go straight , offers any genuine support to stallone . every event not directly related to freddy feels trite and perfunctory ; every scene is given the most obvious spin . actors make choices like the one stallone made with cop land because they believe that the film is going to get noticed , that it could do for them what pulp fiction did for john travolta and bruce willis . he just found one great character . it's the kind of character people revise their career plans for , the kind of role which can make a movie star want to be an actor . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : kenneth johnson , based on the comic book characters created by louise simonson and john bogdanove . director : kenneth johnson . mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , comic book violence ) running time : 97 minutes . it doesn't take long to figure out that there's something decidedly unfashionable about steel . the opening theme song , with its wakka-cha-wakka guitar track , sounds like it was salvaged from a 1970s tv series ; ditto the no-nonsense exposition , arch-villains and even archer performances . all of which is quite appropriate , since writer/director kenneth johnson wrote and directed for 70s adventure series like " the bionic woman " and " the incredible hulk . " you might swear that johnson had made steel 20 years ago , dusted it off and gussied it up with a few modern special effects , if not for the fact that shaquille o'neal would have been in pre-school at the time . the funny thing about steel is that it's so unfashionable it's actually refreshing . he simply acts out of a sense of responsibility . . . and perhaps it helps to have a certain nostalgia for the admittedly b-grade tv steel is modeled after , because it's certainly nobody's idea of stellar film-making . johnson asks little of his actors -- he's used to working with lou ferrigno , for heaven's sake -- offering them direction which seems to consist of " stand there and read your lines . " he seems perfectly aware that steel is a formulaic action film with stock characters and fight scenes placed at carefully spaced intervals , yet he also seems perfectly sincere about his subject . that sincerity is part of what makes steel so improbably satisfying . johnson refuses to wink at steel's selflessness , or to mock him for being such a square ; he refuses to take his straightforward narrative and turn it into a collection of incoherently edited battles peppered with one-liners . steel isn't going to dazzle anybody , particularly the kids who will make up most of the audience . they'll be used to cutting edge effects , chaotic battles and even more chaotic storylines , not the perfectly comprehensible ( if extremely simplistic ) narrative of steel . those kids may find it all pretty old-fashioned , but i hope there's still a place for old-fashioned heroes , the kind who say " yes , ma'am " and mean it . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
it's the moment which is supposed to tell the audience that the film-makers are hip to their own derivativeness , that it's pointless to expect more than recycled genre conventions . maybe the skyscraper is now a school , and maybe the vacationing cop is now a surly teen computer whiz , but the rest will be chapter and verse from the contemporary action film bible -- " die hard in a prep school . " right ? well , yes and no . though masterminds has plenty of die hard in its dna -- including a member of the hero's family among the hostages ( ozzie's stepsister melissa , played by katie stuart ) , a suave villain with an accent ( patrick stewart ) and a hidden agenda for the bad guys -- the reference in the script is actually a clever diversion to distract viewers from all the other antecedents . if you've been watching movies at all over the past twenty years , you've seen masterminds before . you just haven't seen it all in the same movie . of course the primary audience for masterminds _hasn't_ been watching movies for the past twenty years ; in fact , it hasn't been alive for the past twenty years . and it's a fairly satisfying diversion for that audience , as well as one their parents don't need to worry aobut . in a sense , it's the way that it's least like die hard which makes masterminds a solid entertainment for youngsters : you don't need to count dead bodies to keep track of the hero's progress . it's unlikely that adults will find much worthwhile in masterminds , unless it's patrick stewart's jolly performance as the leader of the terrorists . he shows a great sense for delivering what the film's audience demands , sneering and threatening just enough so that it's worth a big cheer when he allows himself to be humiliated . he also understands that the plot of masterminds -- which adults will be ahead of by a solid hour -- is about as inventive as your average episode of " scooby-doo ; " you can practically hear stewart begging to end the film with " . . . and i would have gotten away with it if it hadn't been for that meddling kid . " by the time it reaches its big finale involving a dune buggy chase through the storm drains beneath the school , masterminds has proven itself to be just playful enough to overcome its obviousness . . . particularly for those too young to remember war games , or die hard , or even home alone . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : charles edward pogue , based on characters created by robert e . howard . director : john nicolella . mpaa rating : r ( violence , sexual situations , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 92 minutes . i was feeling a bit under-prepared as i walked into kull the conqueror . after all , i had never seen a minute of the syndicated series " hercules : the legendary journies , " and consequently i was completely unfamiliar with the work of kevin sorbo . what sort of action hero would this fellow be ? did he have the stuff to make it on the big screen ? standard sword-and-sorcery stuff , to be sure , but for a while kull provides enough satisfying spins to the material to keep you grinning . director john nicolella adds some amusing bits of business , like the triumphant and newly-crowned kull receiving discreet advice from his protocol minister to hold his scepter in the other hand . fierstein chews up every goofy line he's got , including the most obscure -- and crudest -- sexual double-entendre in charles edward pogue's script . sorbo leaps into the role with enthusiastic good humor , deciding he's going to find the pleasure in playing the hero . it would have been easy to play kull as camp , to keep winking at the audience to make sure we understood he's really in on the joke . rather than making fun of the genre , sorbo opts for finding the fun _in_ the genre . the result is the kind of energetic action which evokes richard lester's musketeer films , with sorbo providing considerably more than mere pecs appeal . kull the conqueror appears to have so much going for it early on that the final half hour comes as a crashing disappointment . all the energy leaks out of the film , the pacing abruptly drops to a crawl , and the appealing riff on creaky fantasy motifs gives way to creaky fantasy motifs . every line of dialogue becomes a piece of exposition , explaining everything twice so that even the most obtuse viewer might be able to keep up . chances are they may not want to , though , not with the narrative reduced to resolving a second-rate " dungeons and dragons " scenario . sorbo's efforts deserve better ; he gives kull the charismatic spark a good adventure needs . anyone know when the season premiere of " hercules " might be ? see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
mike leigh does not create film stories in a traditional way . his unique method of constructing scripts out of workshops with his actors has made it a safe bet that you won't find flat , flimsy characters running around in his films . you also won't find many traditional plot-driven narratives . at first , we wonder why she bothered . the initial interactions between the two are awkward , the talk exceedingly small . leigh understands the power of shared history to connect people , whether friends or family , even when personalities are polar opposites . so far , so very good , except that the dynamic i've just described comprises less than half of career girls' 87 minute running time . the majority of the film is devoted to flashbacks of the girls' college days , where another possible reason for their friendship becomes evident : they are both so irritating you can't imagine anyone else putting up with them . leigh has put together more than enough fantastic work ( high hopes , life is sweet , naked , secrets & lies ) to have earned the right to a minor stumble , but the stumble in career girls points out the potential danger in leigh's style . if you're going to give the audience a character-driven drama , you'd better not give them characters likely to drive them into the lobby . after making several wonderful films filled with believably complex people , leigh has made half of a wonderful film by making only half of two wonderful characters . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
producers : alix madigan , agios katsikakis , andrew fierberg . director : jonathan nossiter . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , nudity ) running time : 90 minutes . at least he wouldn't have constricted one of the most compelling relationships of the year by subjugating it to a forced sense of social consciousness . nossiter's feature debut , the best dramatic film winner at the 1997 sundance film festival , ponders the nature of identity and the buried desires of lost souls through the story of a chance meeting one sunday in queens . is oliver really matthew delacorta ? though sunday asks plenty of questions without providing many answers , ambiguity isn't its problem . both suchet and harrow give intense , emotionally rich performances as people taking a momentary escape from their bleak lives by clothing themselves in attractive fictions . and self-conscious cinematic trickery like unfocused point-of-view shots when matthew/oliver removes his glasses . as a love story , sunday is often beautiful and haunting . as a film about a serious issue , it looks like a film-maker's attempt to create something to sermonize about in an acceptance speech . screenplay : matthew harrison and kevin corrigan . director : matthew harrison . first , let's clarify all the things kicked in the head is _not_ . it's not a whimsical , surreal urban odyssey like after hours , despite the perplexing executive producer participation of martin scorsese . it's not a good-natured slacker comedy , despite the presence of a hyper-reflective , ambition-deficient protagonist . it's not a gritty-yet-pop-culture-savvy crime dramedy in the tarantino mold , despite the plethora of shootouts and one inane discussion about the planet of the apes movies . and it's not worth a moment of your time . this is independent film-making at its most pointless and self-indulgent , mistaking profanity for profundity and incoherence for avant-garde . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
long-time readers of this space will recall that i have never promoted the myth of critical objectivity . i am merely a man , folks , a flesh-and-blood film fan with preferences and pet peeves just like everyone else . brilliant special effects will never move me like a brilliant script will . i'm indifferent about baseball , but i love baseball movies . " heartwarming comedies " leave me cold . i'm too easy on woody allen sometimes . and so on . the matchmaker appears to have been made with a direct network connection to my cinematic soft spots . now you're just not playing fair . their combined charm is irresistable , flimsy though the story may be . on a number of levels , it's clear that the matchmaker needs a bit more fleshing out . her relationship with sean ( nicely played by david o'hara as a fiery idealist ) is better developed than you find in most romantic comedies , but we never understand why it might be truly important to marcy . it's all very pleasant , in an inconsequential sort of way . then again , if you add up all the things about the matchmaker which are very pleasant , you have a fairly pleasant film experience . first there is garofolo herself , a screen presence unlike any other in film . acerbic , smart and unconventionally beautiful , garofolo improves a story by her mere presence . she doesn't have as strong a character to latch on to as she had in the truth about cats & dogs , but she's still an energetic presence who's easy to root for . o'hara is also quite pleasant , as is o'shea as the ethically shaky matchmaker . and of course there's the scenery and the local irish color , which is very pleasant indeed . the matchmaker has a heavy strain of fish-out-of-water comedy to it , but it rarely reeks of formula thanks to mark joffe's low-key direction and garofolo's ability to underplay a reaction take . still , as the film strolls along towards its conclusion with a few unnecessary intrusions by the political sub-plot , it might be seen as a bit uninspired and tedious , objectively speaking . i'm not objectively speaking , of course . one viewer might find little to like about the matchmaker . another -- who shall remain nameless -- might spend 95 minutes smiling at a friendly face in a friendly place . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : becky johnston , based on the memoir by heinrich harrer . director : jean-jacques annaud . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , violence , profanity ) running time : 137 minutes . if you accept hollywood's version of things , history -- particularly the uglier parts of history -- is what happens while white people are watching . it's not terribly surprising , since studios generally balk at anything remotely depressing ; fears can be allayed if an established anglo actor anchors such projects . so we end up with revolution in south america through the eyes of james woods in salvador , the plight of native americans as seen by kevin costner in dances with wolves , upheaval in burma as it affects patricia arquette in beyond rangoon . . . not one of them a terrible film , but each one compromised by the sense that we couldn't be trusted to identify with a dark face . in fact , these stories aren't even about the culture involved . there is a lot to like about individual moments , technical skill and overall atmosphere in seven years in tibet . an early mountain-climbing sequence is tense and restrained , the location photography is spectacular , and the performances of thewlis and wangchuk ( enchanting as the wise yet playful dalai lama ) are solid and appealing . the relationship between heinrich and the dalai lama is the most effective element in the film , smartly rendered by becky johnston's script . it takes a while for seven years to reach that relationship , but it's well-developed once it becomes the film's focus . it's often hard to see that focus , however , because seven years in tibet is an epic which feels like it's rushing frantically from place to place . there's a lot of ground to cover in harrer's story , probably more than 135 minutes can cover , but that's all we get . rather than finding the solid narrative through-line and sticking with it , the script hunts and pecks for dramatic events over a decade of time . of course , seven years' narrative through-line is the emotional and spiritual growth of harrer , so it's hard to say whether that would have been an improvement . it's not that pitt does a bad job as harrer , though his austrian accent wanders from here to there . in fact , he does a fine job of making harrer more than just a cocky rascal ; he's thoroughly self-absorbed to the point of needing a good spanking . but pitt could give the performance of a lifetime , and we'd still be left with a film which doesn't seem to have its priorities straight . it's true that even a sweeping story needs a protagonist to give broad-scale suffering a human face , but that face doesn't have to be topped by a head of blond hair . if seven years in tibet had not attempted to be more than the biography of an interesting man , i might have enjoyed it much more . instead , its attempts to be a " message " film end up delivering the wrong messages . while the chinese conquest of tibet warrants about five minutes of screen time in seven years in tibet , harrer's project building a movie theater for the dalai lama gets twice that . it's ironic , in a way : even within the film , the media of the west threaten to overwhelm another culture . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : andrew niccol . director : andrew niccol . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , sexual situations , violence ) running time : 105 minutes . gattaca arrives with the kind of " torn from today's headlines " premise which should guarantee a provocative story . studies suggesting genetic predispositions for certain medical conditions and stories of cloned animals have generated the uneasy feeling that ethics are trailing science by too wide a margin . thus vincent and jerome become a team -- vincent providing a healthy body for jerome's identity , and jerome providing the necessary bodily fluids to validate that identity . writer/director andrew niccol does an exceptional job of guiding the feel of this brave new world , from jan roelfs' sterile production design to michael nyman's restrained score , creating an intriguing backdrop for the exploration of how people deal with externally imposed limitations . the concept works ; niccol's execution of that concept often doesn't . gattaca ends up reading much better than it plays , though it doesn't play terribly . it's simply an intellectualized film experience , one which attempts to make its point in overly hushed tones . as many times as vincent is almost discovered in gattaca , the film rarely gets you caught up in his personal predicament . the subject matter is ready-made for inspiring passionate feeling , discomfort or outrage directed at a social order so contrary to our notions of personal responsibility and freedom . it's not enough for niccol to give viewers something to nod their heads at in agreement . it's a particularly frustrating approach because gattaca is unimpeachable on so many other levels . the performances are rock solid , the production values impeccable , and the script well-stocked with supporting characters who have a chance to learn about themselves through vincent's determination . it just doesn't _move_ ; it's a philosophy lesson more than a gripping narrative . gattaca is well-crafted enough that it could very well leave you thinking . if it left you _feeling_ nearly as much , it might be deserving of its own headlines . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
rowan atkinson is the most gifted and versatile comic performer in the english-speaking world , and i only qualify the statement that much for fear of appearing more cosmopolitan than i am . no one is as equally deft at delivering withering insults ( see the various incarnations of his " black adder " character ) and performing priceless , wordless physical comedy ( see the television episodes of " mr . bean " ) . that most americans know him best -- if at all -- as four weddings and a funeral's malapropping priest is a problem in serious need of correction . i'm not sure the film version of bean is going to do it . atkinson's mr . bean is a marvelous comic creation -- a gangly , goggle-eyed maladroit with the mischievous self-absorption of an adolescent and the one-size-too small brown suit to match . launched from a simple situation into wild flights of humor , bean's actions _are_ the plot of a " mr . bean " episode . bean the movie makes the critical error of jamming bean into the same tired , conventional premise which as served as the vehicle for a hundred unconventional comedians . can you say " fish out of water ? " atkinson deserves better . there are a few brilliant bean moments in bean : the opening sequence which finds him shaving every exposed surface on his head ; a super-charged ride on an amusement park motion simulator ; bean pushing a draped painting through a hallway as though it were a gurney . the situations set up by richard curtis and robin driscoll aren't really the problem in bean . it's director mel smith who misses the point that " mr . bean " isn't about other people reacting to bean's absurd antics ; it's about bean responding to his own absurd antics . in one sense , i'm being a bit more harsh than bean deserves , because it's still more entertaining than most hollywood comedies . atkinson is too energetic a performer to allow bean to drift into unwatchability , making for a film which will provide audiences with plenty of satisfying laughs . but i can't help cringing at all the miscalculations that went into bean , most notably the sentimental message which becomes unnecessarily obtrusive . mr . bean growing as a character ? stuff and nonsense . i'd much rather that the makers of bean learned the lesson and produce a bean film deserving of the name , one which doesn't suffer from forced attempts at creating a feature length narrative . let his beloved teddy have more than a token cameo appearance . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
twenty years ago , a film like mad city would have been a provocative and disturbing exploration of how television news can exploit a story to feed our blood-lust . in fact , it was . . . it paddy chayefsky's brilliant script and peter finch's mesmerizing final performance as unraveling anchorman howard beale made network a classic of dark satire , spotlighting the natural culmination of an obsessive pursuit of ratings . it was just outrageous enough to be entertaining , and just plausible enough to be alarming . the notion that televison news isn't just about the news . . . well , it just isn't news . it never manages to arouse much more than nods of recognition , because the images and situations are familiar to the point of cliche : alda's self-important anchorman , the selective editing of a story to fit a pre-determined agenda , the absurdity of a growing media feeding frenzy . as an ethics lesson , it's strident but ineffective , preaching to a nation of converts about a problem they all know exists but have no idea how to correct . it's fortunate , then , that mad city does a solid job of giving its subject a human face . that face doesn't belong to dustin hoffman , though brackett is the story's central character . playing simple challenges any actor , yet travolta plays simple with a disarming effectiveness . the relationship moments between baily and brackett are among the strongest in mad city , though it also provides a few chuckles as the public sympathies sway in the breeze . like most " message " films , however , it begins to wilt every time it underlines its message . mad city's primary stumbling block is its obviousness -- of the character developments , of the plot progression , of the scolding tone the film takes towards its targets . it reaches an audience which doesn't find sensationalism disturbing , but it delivers its story as though no one else had told it before . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
producers : clint eastwood and arnold stiefel . director : clint eastwood . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 151 minutes . here's a brain teaser for all you aspiring screenwriters out there : how do you adapt midnight in the garden of good and evil , a 350-page true-crime drama in which the crime doesn't occur until around page 170 ? before you answer , i should warn you that it's a bit of a trick question . part travelogue , part character study , part cultural anthropology lesson and part courtroom thriller , it combined disparate elements into the hypnotic tale of a unique place . so that screenwriting assignment might be better phrased as : how do you adapt midnight in the garden of good and evil , a 350-page true-crime drama which isn't really a true-crime drama ? john lee hancock had more or less the right idea when he chose to let his screenplay wander and sprawl . that covers the " plot " in a video-guide-summary sense , but it doesn't begin to do justice to what midnight is about . hancock's script wisely retains berendt's willingness to let a collection of colorful characters carry the story in tangential directions , painting a messy but vivid portrait of savannah as ( in kelso's words ) " gone with the wind on mescaline . " director clint eastwood chooses an ideal , languid pace for midnight which turns it into the perfect southern story : in no particular hurry to get anywhere , yet still intriguing in its richness of detail . in berendt's novel , that fragmented approach turns the city of savannah itself into the story's principal character . the williams trial functions primarily as a lightning rod for the attitudes and perceptions of the city's inhabitants , in whom eccentricity is ultimately a matter of degree . there are , however , some vacuums hollywood abhors , and midnight in the garden of good and evil tries to fill two of them with some pretty ineffective stuff . hancock works wonders with the novel's decade-long time frame , condensing events with impressive economy . he also strains to shove the story's square pegs into the gaping round hole of studio picture paradigms . hancock and eastwood may very well have made the best adaptation of midnight possible within a studio system . the acting is first-rate from top to bottom ( including a sly and charismatic debut by the lady chablis as him/herself ) , eastwood's technical team delivers typical excellence , and many of the book's best situations are re-created with sharp humor . there's just something vaguely unsatisfying about midnight , and not just in comparison to its source material . this story cries out for a less conventional treatment , though it's still fairly unconventional by most standards . the makers of midnight had their heart in the right place , but the result teases with the promise of an off-beat exploration it delivers only sporadically . perhaps the answer to that screenwriting assignment is even trickier than the question . you don't . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : david franzoni . producers : debbie allen , steven spielberg and colin wilson . director : steven spielberg . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 153 minutes . amistad is no schindler's list . think it unfair if you must , but steven spielberg is going to face comparisons like that for the rest of his film-making career . in the case of amistad , those comparisons are going to be even harder to avoid , given the proximity in time ( it's spielberg's first " serious " film since the oscar-winning schindler in 1993 ) , the subject matter ( the trials of an oppressed people ) and the situational familiarity ( if it's the december after a spielberg dinosaur movie , it must be time for a spielberg fact-based historical epic ) . spielberg may never make another schindler's list -- even the most successful home run hitter isn't likely to knock _two_ world series-winning grand slams -- but he did raise his personal bar . now that we know what he's capable of , we're not going to let him get away with choosing less than stellar material . amistad is hardly a half-hearted effort ; in fact , there are a couple of scenes which rank with spielberg's best work as a director . it is , however , a piece of material which ends up providing far less impact than it should . amistad is at its best when cinque is telling his story , allowing the electrifying performance of djimon hounsou to take center stage . though he utters only half a dozen english words through the entire film , hounsou's impassioned work brings to life an intelligent man trying to understand a thoroughly perplexing new world . if it had ever been made clear that amistad is cinque's story , the film could have been a masterpiece . instead , david franzoni's script allows too many characters to flirt with the impression that the story is all about them . franzoni also tosses off one of the story's most crucial pieces of historical trivia -- that while slavery was still legal in 1839 , capturing africans was not -- as though it were common knowledge . the " amistad " case was a messy piece of history , but the script only serves to make it messier , obscuring the human drama in a muddle of over-plotting . when amistad does give the africans' plight its undivided attention , it's a gripping piece of film-making . as he did with the horror of the concentration camps , spielberg provides unflinching images of the horrors of slave ships without exploiting those horrors . he also creates a splendid sequence in which one african's bible lesson to cinque is cross-cut with one man's struggle of christian conscience . if only there had been more of those moments , more singularity of purpose , more complexity of character . spielberg brought in schindler scribe steven zaillian to do some doctoring on the amistad script , but the doctor couldn't turn merely good into great . amistad is a solidly made film . it's just no . . . well , you know . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
for what it's worth , i correctly guessed the identity of the killer in scream 2 . . . well , sort of . i suppose i should feel satisfied at my own cleverness , since dimension and the makers of scream 2 have put so much effort into keeping that piece of information secret . even more so than in the original scream , writer kevin williamson goes to ridiculous extremes to keep the audience guessing whodunnit , so ridiculous that the film becomes too focused on the one thing which should have been least important . as a horror film , it's a solid piece of work ; as a satire , it's frequently hilarious . as a mystery , it tries way , way , _way_ too hard . jermaine ? marlon ? tito ? if you can keep the suspects straight without a press kit , more power to you . williamson often seems so concerned with turning every live body in sight into a potential suspect that he lets that question overwhelm everything else . it all builds to a revelatory climax drawn out so long past the point of diminishing returns -- loaded with confessions , motives and false finishes -- that you can't even see the point of diminishing returns from there . i'm being a bit harder on scream 2 than it might deserve , because that one big problem may be the only real problem . williamson's satirical darts are expertly targeted , not just at horror film cliches or the " inevitable inferiority " of sequels , but at the original film itself . the film-within-a-film " stab " provides a few wonderful moments , as do the audience reactions to some of the more improbable situations ( e . g . the dialogue is sharp , smart and not at all afraid of naming names ( cox's " friends " co-stars david schwimmer and jennifer aniston are among those skewered ) , a perfect counter-point to wes craven's crafty suspense scenes . if you're not ready to crawl out of your skin when campbell crawls across the unconscious form of her tormentor , it's time for a pulse check . scream 2 is so entertaining both as a chiller and as a chuckler that the lack of attention to those elements is a frustration . kevin williamson is carving out a new genre for himself which certainly seems to be finding an audience -- both screams and i know what you did last summer take off with the radical notion that umasking the monster is a good idea . there's just something deflating about a tense , comic horror film that turns into a scooby-doo episode . williamson has too much talent as a writer of comedy to keep getting side-tracked by conventions , even if they're conventions he's helping to re-create . scare us or make us laugh . . . we know you can do both . just keep the mystery machine parked at the curb . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
of all the reasons i was pleasantly surprised by good will hunting -- and there were several -- the easiest to identify was its subversive awareness of its own genre . i called long ago for a moratorium on physician-heal-thyself psychiatrists as a cinematic type ; therapy sessions as revelatory contrivance seemed just as ready for mothballs . good will hunting can't possibly steer clear of every pitfall associated with therapy-centered drama , but it's conscious enough of those pitfalls to provide a goofy sense of originality . the script , by damon and his co-star and real-life buddy affleck , keeps the dialogue between will and sean generally smart and smart-alecky ( particularly sharp was a pastoral scene which will describes as a " taster's choice moment between the guys " ) . the arc of their relationship is convincing and patiently developed , with williams and damon sharing an impressive chemistry . the performances are consistently strong enough ( even robin williams in his " bearded , ergo serious " mode ) to carry good will hunting through its inevitable dips into confrontation , as well as a running time which could have used a judicious twenty minutes of trimming . strongest of all is damon himself in a dazzlingly charismatic piece of screen acting . both believably brilliant and convincingly rough around the edges , damon avoids the too-common actor's trap of white-washing his character's dark side . it's too conventional an instinct for a director who has rarely done anything the conventional way , offering damon a protection he simply doesn't need . as both actor and writer , matt damon gives good will hunting energy , soul and a welcome desire to avoid trite situations . it's a rare drama which satisfies without pandering , a feel-good , heal-good session which gives you just a little hope that every trip to the couch doesn't have to be a trip into cliche-land . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
their earnest , well-crafted stories of folks caught up in the turbulence of political violence have moved many viewers to heap adjectives of praise upon their films . and while all this occurs , i find myself sitting and thinking , " you know , it was good , but . . . " sheridan and george's latest collaboration , the boxer , falls into a very similar category . there are always plenty of things to like about a sheridan film , most notably his ability to create a vibrant sense of place . the divided belfast of the boxer is a startling image , with its physical wall dividing the people even more concretely than the differing ideologies . the insanity and self-perpetuating violence of the irish conflict are starkly portrayed , with more ambiguity surrounding the question of right and wrong than most films on the subject -- including sheridan and george's own previous films -- have managed to explore . for all its welcome complexity of theme , however , the boxer tends to drift in the exploration of its main characters . nowhere is this more evident than in the love story between danny and maggie , a star-crossed romance which feels more obligatory than well-developed . furtive glances and snatches of conversation establish tension between them , but their connection is never entirely convincing . in one sense , it's an effective device which turns him into an abstract rallying point for the ira rather than an individual human being . none of which is to suggest that the performances aren't strong from top to bottom , because they are . daniel day-lewis brings a resigned dignity to danny ; his unwillingness to return to the ira's ways seems as much a result of fatigue than moral scruple . their stories always hold your attention , but they never engross the way great film stories do . perhaps my sense in the boxer , and with in the name of the father and some mother's son for that matter , is that sheridan and george are more interested in making a point than making a movie . the result is a cerebral film with too little gut-level emotion . sheridan and george are good film-makers , but they could be great if they were as attentive to their people as to their politics . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " .

director : peter hewitt . mpaa rating : pg ( mild vulgarity ) running time : 83 minutes . the borrowers is the kind of goofy charmer of a family adventure film hollywood should be able to make it its sleep , if only it would bother . the premise posits the existence of 4-inch-tall beings called borrowers who live beneath the floorboards and in the walls of human homes , making their living off the bits and pieces we always seem to be misplacing -- a loose button for a plate here , a sock for a bed there . first : why can't more films employ special effects with the borrowers' unobtrusive whimsy ? visual effects supervisor peter chiang , production designer gemma jackson and cinematographers john fenner and trevor brooker have joined forces to fashion a warm , visually enthralling world for the film's characters , in which the oversized props and camera trickery serve a purpose besides calling attention to themselves . humans and borrowers interact convincingly , creating wild and thoroughly entertaining set pieces . it's a great-looking , lively piece of work with neat bits of throwaway business -- a monopoly card hung on the clocks' wall like a pop art showpiece -- and a crisp pace . the second , more disspiriting question : when and why did it become obligatory for every children's film to aim for cheap chuckles from bodily functions ? for most of its running time , the borrowers' slapstick comedy is disarming in its cartoonish innocence -- foam in the face , cheese on the head , exaggerated electrocutions and pratfalls . why , then , do we need to see peagreen immersed in a massive pile of dog droppings ? why the running gag about a flatulent hound ? is it really so difficult to fill 83 minutes with entertainment a parent can share with a child sans embarassment ? there's so much immagination throughout the borrowers that it's even more disappointing to find it swinging so typically below the belt . there's nothing particularly ground-breaking about the basic story-line of the borrowers , which melds the recent mouse hunt with a teen alienation sub-plot as arietty longs to find other borrowers . the appeal of the film comes not from narrative wackiness , but from the complementary pairing of john goodman's snarling villainy with the storybook delights of the film's overall look and feel . sure , it stumbles occasionally in the ways its most like most ostensibly " family films " of recent years . it's the ways in which the borrowers is least like its genre cousins which should make it satisfying matinee viewing . this is fantasy escapism which doesn't make you feel stupid for escaping . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
i wanted to like eve's bayou even more than i did , for many of the same reasons i suspect some critics have been overly effusive in their praise . after all , here was a film with an african-american cast in which race was largely irrelevant to the story . here was a film directed by an african-american woman , adding some much-needed pigment and estrogen to a club even more conspicuously male than it is conspicuously white . here was a first time film-maker , and a pretty decent one at that , adding the " excitement of discovery " factor . and here was a film which was actually _about_ something . kasi lemmons' writing and directing debut certainly deserves better than to be singled out for the race either of lemmons or her cast . far from being a simple domestic drama , eve's bayou delves into the complex subjects of memory and perception . events are constantly being revisited and re-evaluated , in scenes crafted by lemmons with a seductive ambiguity . in the film's finest moment , eve's aunt mozelle ( debbi morgan ) recalls a painful moment as a reflection in a mirror , moving from observer to participant in a few short steps . it's a lyrical and thought-provoking film lemmons has fashioned , in which the interpretation of events becomes ever more challenging . lemmons does such a fine job of introducing ideas and creating images that the more fundamental failings of eve's bayou become all the more disappointing . the narrative grabs at bits and pieces of atmosphere -- period art direction , voodoo curses , french dialects -- without ever really settling into a convincing sense of place . as for the much-lauded acting . . . well , morgan is certainly solid as the solemn mozelle . other performances are far more sporadic , from a nondescript lynn whitfield to a bug-eyed diahann carroll as a cackling voodoo priestess . make no mistake , eve's bayou is a good film : deeply felt , consistently intriguing and often visually striking . it's also a wonderful thing that a female african-american first-time film-maker has done such impressive work . even adding those things together doesn't make eve's bayou a great film , however . certainly i'll be looking forward to lemmon's next project , when that raw talent as a director and passion as a story-teller join forces with a bit more focus and discipline . then it might be time to start talking about lemmons as an a-list director , irrespective of race , or gender , or how many films she has made . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
producers : marshall herkovitz , edward zwick , arnon milchan , sarah caplan . director : marshall herskovitz . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , sexual situations , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 115 minutes . for quite a while , dangerous beauty tempts you with an irresistable combination of compelling substance in a glorious package . . . quite fitting , considering the premise . yes , even the now-married marco . if you smell a tale of degradation and class warfare in the making , sniff again . dangerous beauty actually paints quite a rosy portrait of veronica's life while presenting an intriguing history lesson in gender politics . when the other option is mute insignificance , prostitution suddenly seems considerably less cruel a fate . director marshall herskovitz wraps this tale in enough style , romance and humor that it's usually as entertaining as it is provocative . sumptuous production design renders 16th century venice in romanticized colors and dark interiors , accentuated by lucianna arrighi's marvelous costumes . the central pairing of sewell and mccormack generates heat and tension as the two characters negotiate the tricky parameters of their relationship . then again , mccormack never hits a single false note in her performance , her expressive face registering emotions ranging from innocence to astonishment to wicked wit . for well over three quarters of its running time , dangerous beauty is an unqualified pleasure . you can feel free to leave the theater when the plague strikes fair venice , because at that point it quickly degenerates into thematic proclamations and over-wrought courtroom confrontations . after offering well over an hour of subversive notions cloaked in costume drama , jeannine dominy's script plants veronica on a soapbox for the deliver of an i-am-renaissance-woman-hear-me-roar manifesto , inspiring all and sundry to leap to their feet in an " oh captain , my captain " show of solidarity . don't let those cheap theatrics wash the good taste of the rest of dangerous beauty out of your mouth . mccormack's radiant performance and an unusual exploration of primitive feminism give it the real punch its forced conclusion tries too hard to provide . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
director : richard linklater . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( frequent profanity , violence ) running time : 122 minutes . i've got to be honest with you : if i were producing a " true crime " bio-pic , richard linklater would not be my first choice as director . in fact , i'm not sure he'd make the top fifty . not exactly the stuff of which blazing shootouts and narrow getaways are made , is it ? as one might expect , there is an amiable , unhurried pace to richard linklater's the newton boys . the surprise is that it turns out to be one of the film's most appealing qualities . from the opening credits , it is clear that linklater is aiming for an old-fashioned whimsy in his telling of the tale . the title cards are styled after silent films , with " the players " introduced in sienna-tinted head shots , tipping their hats to the camera . the newton boys generally paints its protagonists as light-hearted , almost casual outlaws , polite young men who happened to be very good at robbing banks and milked one effective modus operandi for all it was worth . even the obligatory montage sequence , spinning newspaper headlines and all , is edited with a less frantic sense of urgency than you might expect . the newton boys is such a lightweight bit of history that it sometimes threatens to float away entirely whenever there's not a robbery going on . the characters are energetically portrayed by the top-notch cast , but they're little more than a token trait a piece -- joe is the religious one , brentwood is the cautious one , jess is the cocky drunken one , dock is . . . well , the _other_ cocky drunken one . even then , the attempts to flesh out his life -- a romance with a single mother ( julianna margulies ) , ill-fated attempts to funnel his ill-gotten gains into legitimate businesses -- feel half-hearted and only sporadically effective . still , there's something undeniably charming about the newton boys , some intangible alchemy between the actors' obvious enjoyment of their roles and a story with no greater agenda than spotlighting a previously unknown bit of americana . two hours may be a bit too much time to support the substance of the newton boys , but if you've indulged linklater's episodic films in the past , you probably won't be disappointed by his willingness to wander down the side roads of a story . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
i recall being only mildly impressed with david mamet's house of games when i first saw it a decade ago , despite general critical acclaim . sure , it was a meticulously crafted intellectual puzzle , and , even more impressive , it was a puzzle which didn't fall apart completely as you were thinking about it on the way home . with lindsey crouse serving serving as its remote heroine , however , all its unpredictable twists felt like they were taking place in a vacuum , leaving little reason to care about anyone in the story . crafty , yes , but soulless . five years of wading through cinema at its most mind-numbing has given me a new appreciation for meticulously crafted intellectual puzzles , even if they are of the soulless variety . mamet's new psychological mystery the spanish prisoner , a thoroughly intriguing cinematic engine , definitely falls into that category . unfortunately for joe , little of that milk looks likely to end up in his cup . it's best to cut off any plot summary at this point , lest certain turns of narrative be inadvertently revealed . suffice it to say that the spanish prisoner tackles familiar mamet subjects like breakdowns in trust and deceptive appearances , accompanied by the familiar-bordering-on-cliche staccato rhythms of mamet's dialogue . it also features crisp pacing courtesy of editor barbara tulliver , and yet another insinuating score from the gifted carter burwell . most significantly , it features a story which manipulates in all the best senses of the word . in an era where most films leave you suspecting the re-writes had been commissioned from a room full of chimps , the spanish prisoner treats an audience with respect -- no cheap tricks , no flip-a-coin-to-pick-the-killer endings , just a smart and surprising entertainment . there's a lot to admire about the construction of the spanish prisoner , but it shouldn't be so difficult to find a sympathetic human protagonist to guide a story like this . while steve martin does marvelously cagey work as the mysterious jimmy -- he's one of the few cast members who seems to have a grip on mamet's style -- scott feels as though he's being pulled grudgingly through the story because _somebody's_ got to be the hero . even with its lack of a vibrant hero , i can't be too hard on the spanish prisoner . in fact , that absence only really started to bother me on the way home , which is usually where the plots of such films start to bother me . i do wish that mamet , who clearly has mastered the art of plotting , could make his films as emotionally compelling as they are intellectually satisfying . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : peter howitt . director : peter howitt . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 105 minutes . how much does that one , seemingly inconsequential variable change the woman's life ? sliding doors is a gimmick film , the gimmick being that it allows us to watch both alternate courses determined by that one moment . sliding doors works on enough different levels that i wonder whether it succeeds because of its gimmick or in spite of it . as a straightforward relationship comedy , it's generally delightful , crafted by writer/director peter howitt with unusually sharp comic dialogue . the principal characters are uniformly well-drawn , from the unsteady confidence of paltrow's helen , to the genial wit of hannah's james , to the confused and almost sympathetic philandering of lynch's gerry . even a minor supporting performance from douglas mcferran as james' no-nonsense best friend shines with energy and humor . howitt explores familiar modern romance territory , but does it with enough intelligence and commitment to the characters that it feels fresh . of course , he's also playing an extended game of " what if " , one which sometimes intrudes on the perfectly enjoyable conventional narrative . though rookie director howitt handles the interplay between the story-lines with surprising deftness , the shifts from one plot to the other often deny both plots momentum . nowhere is this more evident than during a pair of climactic confrontations , where howitt cuts back and forth to the point of distraction . he may be intending to build tension , but instead he builds frustration , using neck-stapping editing to show the pivotal moments occurring simultaneously while sacrificing dramatic urgency . a version of sliding doors which offered a simple , smartly-written romantic triangle might have been just as winning without all the fuss . it's also true that something would have been lost . though at first glance sliding doors seems to flirt with the celebration of fate and destiny so popular in recent love stories , howitt offers something a bit more thought-provoking than that . by allowing us to get to know the characters -- and helen in particular -- as well as he does , he gives us much more reason to believe that destiny is simply the tendency of people to act according to their character . helen's determination , pride and sense of self-worth are what make it likely that any course of her life will have a happy ending , not the capricious opening or closing of a pair of sliding doors on a train . the film may be a bit of speculative gimmickry , but it's also something more -- and less -- than that . in some alternate reality , peter howitt may have made sliding doors a romantic comedy without a gimmick . like helen's life , it's hard to know for sure which version would have been more engaging and appealing . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : andrei kourkov . producers : pierre rival , mykola machenko . director : vyacheslav krishtofovich . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 107 minutes . this might seem like the premise for a slapstick farce ; in fact , it might sound strangely similar to the premise for warren beatty's current bulworth . but like bulworth , a friend of the deceased takes that premise and steers it into some astute social commentary . director vyacheslav krishtofovich and screenwriter andrei kourkov may romanticize the communist past , but they also paint an intriguing picture of people adapting to the capitalist present . a friend of the deceased might have been an even more compelling film if it had been more consistent , both in tone and pacing . at times it takes on the tense atmosphere of an espionage thriller ; at other times , it has the loping pace of deadpan comedy ; at still other times , there is the stark sincerity of domestic drama . each is effective in its own way , but in combination they can leave you wondering how you're supposed to feel about the strange events in anatoly's life . fortunately , that confusion plays a significant role in this story of complex social change where the rules are still being determined . it is also fortunate that alexandre lazarev , with his soulful eyes and weary decency , makes for such a sympathetic tour guide through this world . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : rita hsiao , christopher sanders , philip lazebnik , raymond singer & eugenia bostwick-singer . mpaa rating : g ( mild cartoon violence ) running time : 90 minutes . ever since the little mermaid re-vitalized disney's animation efforts in 1989 , the studio's annual animated feature has been one of the year's most scrutinized releases . now that no one expects $300 million every time out of the gate , maybe disney will get the credit it is due for pushing the limits of animated film-making . mulan defies convention yet again , bypassing the well-trodden ground of western literature and mythology to tell a 2 , 000-year-old tale from chinese legend . the " yentl goes to china " plot line is basic disney stuff on a certain level -- yearning young protagonist , societal restrictions , complicated romance , lessons in personal growth and tolerance of individuality all around . it's a bit surprising then to find the set-up as drawn-out as it is in mulan . though there's a bit of comic relief in the bumbling encounter with the matchmaker , the first half hour is largely devoted to character development and motivation -- good things on general principle , of course , but over-indulged here to contribute to an extremely slow start . it doesn't help that the early songs by david zippel and matthew wilder -- yes , the same matthew wilder of " break my stride " fame -- are the kind of uninspired post-howard ashman ditties which make you wish someone could get over the broadway musical paradigm for animated features . that opening 25-minute stretch is plenty earnest , but it's hardly confidence-inspiring . when mulan finally does hit its own stride , beginning with the visually striking sequence in which mulan leaves home , it's a solid and energetic piece of work . the script incorporates comic relief into its redemption story much better than pocahontas or hunchback wedged in its token gags , providing a fine showcase for eddie murphy's fast-talking dragon and harvey fierstein's entertainingly incongruous voicing of a he-man soldier . the musical numbers also pick up steam in the second half of the film , perhaps not providing break-out hummable hits but at least setting a firm musical tone . mostly , however , the film becomes a dazzling adventure , highlighted by a spectacular battle sequence between huns and chinese soldiers in a snowy mountain pass . by the time the sharply-paced climactic confrontation rolls around , with its balanced doses of humor and suspense , you may have forgotten mulan's less-than-stellar start . i suppose what gives mulan an added kick are the touches which stray from familiar disney patterns . notably , the villainous shan-yu remains in the background for most of the film as a mysterious genuine threat -- no comic sidekicks , no songs , no glib one-liners . that leaves more time to develop mulan's resourcefulness , creating a smart and savvy heroine who happens to be an asian woman , a rarity not just in animated films but in films of any kind . this may not be the kind of cuddly , inviting film of which stuffed animal sales and video buying binges are made ; indeed , it may be over the head of kids much younger than 7 or 8 . fact is , it doesn't exactly warrant that ubiquitous disney label of " masterpiece .

screenplay : chris carter . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 115 minutes . two key questions surrounded the big-screen incarnation of the x files , one applicable to each of the film's two potential audiences . for those unfamiliar with the series , the question was whether the uninitiated could follow a labyrinthine plot even die-hard fans don't entirely understand . in retrospect , it's hard to believe the first question was ever a question at all . after all , how many revelations could you expect in a film where even the title was a source of conflicting information -- was it the x files : fight the future ? the x files movie ? just plain the x files ( for the record , the only title that appears on screen ) ? yes , the story does launch from this year's season finale , placing mulder and scully on a relatively mundane detail after the fbi shut down mulder's paranormal-focused project " the x-files . " and yes , it does give mulder and scully a bit of quality personal time together . but does it throw open every door and tie up every loose end ? please . . . you'd be more likely to find the cigarette-smoking man chomping away on nicorette gum . yet there's something strange about moving the show's moody claustrophobia to the big screen . cinematographer ward russell maintains the high quality which has long made " the x-files " one of the best-looking shows on television , but the problem is less one of style than it is one of scale . blown up larger than life , the conspirators seem less sinister , the situations less sublimely creepy . the atmosphere may leave some fans wondering who took their mulder and scully and dropped them into a summer action blockbuster . which brings us to question number two : how does the x files play if you've never seen mulder and scully before in your life ? quite simply , it's an sharp suspense thriller which sets up the characters and situations with impressive effectiveness and economy . director rob bowman complements the necessary exposition with energetic , visually arresting set pieces , creating a visceral entertainment as satisfying as anything else you'll find in a multiplex . though " x-files " novices may be left behind with references to the lone gunmen and mulder's notoriously deadpan demeanor , it doesn't take familiarity with the series to get a charge out of the well-paced chases , or a chuckle out of mulder using a poster from a certain 1996 blockbuster as an impromptu urinal . it's important for those viewers to know that they can have a perfectly enjoyable time with the x files and still not understand exactly what's going on after the film has ended . in fact , the x files may work best as a cunning lure , drawing potential new viewers into the fold with a final shot that might as well have included a " to be continued . . . " caption . regular viewers , on the other hand , have seen better stories with these characters . maybe that should have been the real first question : how do you make a unique film event from a series where the quality already regularly surpasses most theatrical films ? the truth is only partially out there in the x files , and the truth is that x-philes with high expectations may be much harder to please than the average summer movie-goer . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
in contemporary popular art , there's a very fine line between sheer brilliance and head-smacking pretentiousness . it's a line most visionary film directors flirt with on a regular basis , to the point of tying said line into the occasional sheepshank knots . it almost seems as though , for all their periodic misfires , film-makers like david lynch , terry gilliam and stanley kubrick have no choice but to take you places no one else can or will take you . you suspect that even though the film you are watching may not be great , the creative mind behind it could be . darren aronofsky's debut feature pi may not be a work of pure originality -- the echoes of lynch's eraserhead are too distinct -- but i can virtually guarantee you won't see anything else like it this year . at its core , pi is an icarus fable of a man reaching for knowledge beyond his capacity to handle it , with a side order of cyber-era isolation cautionary tale . aronofsky uses voice-over narration effectively to get us inside max's seizure-wracked head ( with superb musical assistance from clint mansell of pop will eat itself ) , showing us the world as an actualized paranoid fantasy viewed through a self-imposed cage of computers . pi might have been a frighteningly engrossing character study if only sean gullette had been able to match the intensity of the material . his steven wright-as-computer geek demeanor suggests a typical socially-challenged nerd more often than a man spinning into madness ; though he didn't need to bug out his eyes and foam at the mouth , he did need to place max close enough to the edge for us to see the bottom from there . gullette's competent but distant performance lowers the stakes of pi's twisted conspiracy theoretics . yes , he does stretch too hard at times to achieve his lynchian vibe -- grainy black-and-white photography , a mysterious sticky substance , blinding flashes of light and a brain covered with ants do not necessarily a profound statement make . but who else would construct a psychological thriller around large number theory , wall street and the kaballah ? who else would create visuals as distinct as max's techno-organic apartment , or make an audience squirm so violently at the do-not-try-this-at-home use of a certain power tool ? and who else has demonstrated the cinematic instincts to turn a scene of a man writing down numbers into something more tension-packed than a dozen hollywood chase scenes . the most obvious antecedent may be lynch , but even lynch's hypnotic images have rarely been this kinetic . though aronofsky may have been limited by finances , available talent or technical constraints , he has created a work which leaves you hungry for what he could do next . pi is the creation of that one film-maker in a hundred who seems unlikely to make movies by the numbers . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
if you've ever seen or read an interview with vincent gallo , it's probably obvious why he decided to make his own movie : other people seem to irritate him to distraction . so rather than make a film with all the folks he holds in such contempt , gallo decided to do it all himself . wearing that many hats should qualify him as some sort of rack . fortunately , gallo has the head and the talent to pull it off for the most part . a visually provocative if occasionally under-developed character study , buffalo '66 tells the story of billy brown ( gallo ) , a lifetime loser from buffalo , ny . the premise sounds like the set-up for farce or black comedy , but buffalo '66 is actually a sharply-observed character study . gallo's billy is a portrait in emotional immaturity , his child-like name indicative of his inability to act like an adult . gallo is superb in front of the camera , but he's just as impressive behind it . typically , actors-turned-directors point their camera at the actors and let them do their thing . there's nothing typical about gallo , however . his direction tends towards the showy , but the show always reaches for a specific emotion . with the instincts of a visual artist , gallo makes buffalo '66 undeniably visual . it's only as a screenwriter that gallo comes up wanting . as complex and well-developed as billy may be , layla is that sketchy . the talented ricci tries to invest some real humanity in the character , but too often she's little more than a powder blue baby-doll fantasy . that choice only makes sense if buffalo '66 is an elaborate surrealist fable , which would negate much of the compelling pathos in billy's character . still , it's hard not to notice how much more gallo does right with buffalo '66 . he may have stretched his diverse talents thin , but he proved he could do it his way . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : don roos . director : don roos . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 100 minutes . the opposite of sex may actually be too limiting a title for screenwriter don roos' tart-tongued directorial debut . after winding its way through relationship comedy , road picture grit and a dozen genre stops in between , it turns out to be the opposite of nearly everything it first appears to be , including : long-time readers know of my disdain for voice-over narration as a substitute for effective film storytelling . the opposite of sex opens with a warning from dedee truitt ( christina ricci ) , the 16-year-old vixen at the center of the story : " if you're one of those people who don't like movies where some person you can't see talks the whole time and covers up the holes in the plot . . . then like most of dedee's comments , that one isn't particularly trustworthy . roos turns dedee's bitchy , politically-incorrect narration into an effective tool for understanding characters and subverting expectations , enough to make me soften my absolutist anti-narration stance . that's not to say that the film is all about caustic indifference . in fact , it's . . . roos has little interest in wallowing in indie-pic nihilism . despite the multitude of quirky touches , the opposite of sex is a surprisingly human story of people for whom sex is either frightening , or manipulative , or a substitute for something more substantial . playing a character so profoundly disappointed by life that everything and everyone similarly disappoints her , she moves and speaks like a perpetually constricted sphincter muscle . it's a brutally funny and quite touching performance , one of the year's best . it also makes it clear that the opposite of sex is . . . for some reason , roos ( single white female , boys on the side ) has generally written much more compelling female characters than male characters through his career . even lyle lovett , as the gentle sheriff with a crush on lucia , is given too little shading for the important role he ultimately plays . only martin donovan , always adept at fleshing out minimalist characterizations with piercing glances , emerges fully-formed . roos covers up several weaknesses with his sharp dialogue , but he can't hide the sketchy male roles , nor the fact that the opposite of sex is . . . every once in a while , roos gets overtly cinematic on us -- a slow pan after a gunshot is heard , a sentimental montage of bill after matt leaves . otherwise , the opposite of sex might as well be a stage play , a collection of static medium compositions of characters in conversation . fortunately , those conversations are full of quotable lines and keen insights into the way we use and abuse sex , and vice-versa . don't expect dumb comedy , gratuitous titillation or cheap sentimentality from the opposite of sex . you're going to get the opposite of all that . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
" i don't believe in fate , " says erin castleton ( hope davis ) , the wistful heroine looking for love in next stop wonderland , but _someone_ calling the shots on contemporary romantic comedy sure does . earlier this year , sliding doors offered yet another speculative stab at how and why we meet our soulmates . something in the zeitgeist has film-makers falling over themselves to convince us that mr . or ms . right is out there , somewhere , just waiting for us to go to the right party or step on the right elevator . next stop wonderland falls into that category , but only in the most nominal sense . the reason next stop wonderland never feels exactly like a fated romance is that it feels so grounded in the simple reality of its protagonist . it's as complete a female characterization as we've seen this year -- she's smart , clever , just vulnerable enough that you feel for her , just tough enough that you trust her . anderson directs with a 1990s woody allen vibe , complete with jump edits and hand-held camera work , yet the film never comes off as derivative of either the allen oeuvre or other sleepless-style comedies . a character who grabs your interest can do that for a story . gelfant is appealing in a low-key way , but he never gets the audience as emotionally invested in alan's hopes and dreams as davis does in erin's . the odd fringe benefit of this imbalance is that it takes the focus off the question that dogged other films employing this gimmick : why should we think these two people belong together ? the coda which has been added since the film screened at the sundance film festival makes that concern even more central . the ending is no longer happy just because these two people meet , but because it looks like they could be happy together , and davis's delightful performance invests us in her happiness . next stop wonderland is a sweet and entertaining fairy tale not just because she finds prince charming , but because the one fate we care about -- erin's fate -- is the only one the film is realy concerned with . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : david levien and brian koppelman . director : john dahl . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 119 minutes . in the ongoing tastes-great-less-filling verbal war of attrition between john q . critic and joe b . average movie-goer , a crucial common ground often gets overlooked . on the same fundamental level , every one of us loves to be taken somewhere we've never been before , to be told a story in a way it's never been told before . at their most engrossing , movies offer the giddy thrill of the utterly new . at its most engrossing , that's exactly what rounders offers : a fascinating glimpse inside the world of high-stakes poker . and oh , how much we learn while he does so . writers david levien and brian koppelman use damon's narration much the same way ray liotta's narration was used in goodfellas -- as a sociology lesson . it's utterly fascinating , whether the setting is a back alley card room or a gaudy atlantic city casino . damon anchors the story in a solid performance as a man beginning to understand that he has a gift , not a problem . though hooked on the thrill of winning , he's no different than a performer hooked on the thrill of an audience's reaction . rounders has such a solid hook that it's disappointing to watch it drift into a handful of distracting sub-plots . even the old-school chemistry between damon and norton -- full of almost-charming , can't-help-myself sleaze as the compulsively crooked worm -- feels less genuine than it should . if anything positive comes out of these half-formed relationships , it's the sense that mike's best friend is really the game . damon's charisma is never more potent than in the climactic showdown with the russian gangster who beat him in the game that broke him ( john malkovich , employing his dead eyes to perfect effect and a boris badinov accent with considerably less success ) . for that confrontation , the narration grows conspicuously silent at key points , trusting you to grasp the game to which you have been introduced . viewers who used to think of poker simply as gambling may have to re-think their position after sitting through rounders . this tale shows us a different world entirely -- the world of card-player as tortured artist . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : todd alcott and chris weitz & paul weitz . mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , violent situations ) running time : 83 minutes . so dreamworks' antz gets to be first out of the gate in the computer-animated insect sweepstakes , beating disney/pixar's a bug's life to the screen by a good two months . the folks at dreamworks probably felt that meant they could set the standard and avoid comparisons , but that's not entirely true . disney's 1995 toy story became the first , best standard-bearer , a wonderfully witty adventure which established that no amount of visual virtuosity could push aside the power of a great script . there was little doubt that three years of technological innovation would make antz more spectacular to look at . the question was whether these anthropomorphized insects would be asked to carry a story that felt like twenty times their body weight . it looks like the film-makers behind antz learned the right lessons from toy story . antz may not be in toy story's league when it comes to charm and ingenuity , but it's a clever and appealing piece of work in its own right . the goofy socio-political overtones of z's struggle for individuality are good for a few chuckles , though it's not entirely clear from one moment to the next what the " message " is . at other times , the needs of the many are shown to outweigh the needs of the few . and that's not the only place where the story feels less than cohesive . sub-plots abound , many of which fill time without moving the story anywhere . the ideas for individual scenes play much more effectively in the moment than they do upon reflection , where they don't feel completely unified . then again , it's hard not to be caught up in the moment while watching antz . the visuals are nothing short of spectacular , in terms of both scale and individual detail . when thousands of ants form a wrecking ball or a column to serve a unified purpose , thousands of individual limbs and antennae waving , the effect is dazzling . there are also some effectively creepy images of a war between ants and acid-spewing termites ( the kind which might spook youngsters ) . perhaps even more breath-taking are the facial expressions created for the characters . the movements and reactions are so complete that every ant becomes real on the screen . with so much attention lavished on giving the characters personality , antz never feels merely showy , as impressive as it is from start to finish . not that the animators were solely responsible for giving the characters personality . antz boasts an impressive cast of voice talent , from hackman as the eugenically-inclined dictator-in-waiting to christopher walken as he morally ambivalent henchman , from stallone deftly playing good-natured lug to dan aykroyd and jane curtin as a pair of wasp-ish wasps named chip and muffy . but the star of the show is woody allen , bringing his inimitable , anxiety-ridden nebbishness to z . some of his lines are pure vintage woody ( on whether he " laughs in the face of death " : " actually , i generally . . . make sarcastic remarks behind death's back " ) , which makes it even more of an incongruous pleasure thinking of him as a romantic action hero . his voice performance is one of several reasons antz is plenty of fun , if often in an inside-jokey , over the head of kids kind of way . as a story it's uneven , but it still satisfies ; it may not be toy story , but few things are . and it has succeeded at setting a reasonably high bar for the next computer-generated bug film to jump over with all six legs . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : stanley tucci . director : stanley tucci . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , sexual situations ) running time : 102 minutes . it has long been one of my most closely-held dramatic axioms that there is no middle ground when it comes to the execution of farce . either a writer and director get it , or they don't . if they get it , the result is exhilarating comic brilliance . if they don't get it , the result is nearly unendurable . and never , i believed , could the twain meet . another false dichotomy bites the dust . writer/director stanley tucci's the impostors is old-fashioned farce that floats along amusingly , yet only occasionally hits the high notes that turn chuckles into gut-busters . it's a classic screwball farce set-up , which tucci cleverly chooses to place in the classic screwball farce era of the 1930s . opening with a great bit of pantomime accompanying the opening credits , tucci establishes arthur and maurice as protagonists in the mold of the classic silent film comedians -- lovable losers , not above a bit of duplicity if it suits their purposes , yet ultimately heroic ( and , in particular , chivalric ) . the pre-shipboard scenes , though little more than isolated comedy sketches , do a nice job of showing the chemistry between the two . by the time the intercontinental hits the open sea , tucci and platt's starving , utterly sincere artistes have generated plenty of good will . i was ready for the impostors to soar once arthur and maurice began dashing from stateroom to stateroom ; instead , it levels off at a pleasant cruising altitude . tucci populates the ship with plenty of goofy characters -- a fascistic head steward ( campbell scott ) , a suicidal entertainer incongruously named happy ( steve buscemi ) , a wallflower heiress ( hope davis ) , a deposed monarch-in-hiding ( isabella rossellini ) -- clearly intended to make arthur and maurice look like the sane ones in a sea of chaos . yet he doesn't allow these characters to function in scenes that build comic momentum . tucci's gags are mostly of the hit-and-run variety . while there are a few admittedly hilarious ones , they seem like wasted opportunities to do what great farce does best : have each comic moment draw from the previous comic moment , and lead into the next comic moment , in a hysterically unstoppable domino effect . those missed opportunities are most evident when tucci _does_ allow a scene to build momentum . such fourth wall-breaking captures farce at its anything-for-a-laugh finest . more often , tucci goes for the gentle touch which worked so well in big night . as frisky and unpretentious a comedy as the impostors is , it traffics in an unnecessarily restrained level of lunacy . tucci's spin on monkey business has plenty of funny business , but it doesn't let anarchy reign quite as often as it should . it's that rarest of comedic animals : the merely-good farce . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : gary ross . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( sexual situations , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 122 minutes . in pleasantville u . s . a . , it's always 72 degrees and sunny . the world and its values are completely black-and-white -- particularly white in the case of the population demographics . in pleasantville everything is always perfect , it's always 1958 , and nothing ever changes . the one minor problem with pleasantville is that it doesn't exist , nor has it ever existed . it's the world of an innocuous 1950s family sit-com , played in perpetual reruns on a cable nostalgia network . it's a great high-concept premise which could have worked strictly as a fish-out-of-water comedy . screenwriter gary ross ( big , dave ) continues to show a flair for high concepts with a human touch in his directorial debut , generating laughs from the clash of eisenhower-era and clinton-era mores , as well as from characters awakening to the fact that seeking fulfillment may mean an end to their static bliss . but pleasantville isn't merely a whimsical lark . as he exposes his characters to experiences they'd never even considered , ross turns the film into a pointed examination of what we really mean when we talk about " traditional family values . " pleasantville digs into the barely-concealed anxiety and xenophobia at the heart of so much political retro-think , yet that's not even the film's most daring idea . ross has the guts to take on the notion of original sin itself , suggesting that the very passion and curiosity which lead to upheaval in paradise are also what make us most alive and most human , giving color to an otherwise monochromatic existence . it's unfortunate that ross gets a bit too self-congratulatory about his social satire , particularly in the final half-hour . as tensions build in pleasantville , the battle becomes a clash between those characters still in black-and-white and those whose new , life-changing experiences have left them " colored " -- and that may be the _least_ consistently underlined point . pleasantville is a funny and thoughtful film , the kind that works best before it starts tattooing the moral of the story across your backbrain . it's plenty entertaining just watching the mythology of the " good old days " laid bare , exposed as a comforting fiction far removed from a world where coping with change is more productive than demonizing it . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
making a movie about racism is virtually a no-win proposition . ninety-nine percent of the time , a film-maker will spend two hours making it excruciatingly clear that racism is bad , inspiring either righteous nods of approval or rolled eyes at the explication of the self-evident . we all feel good abour ourselves as right-thinking people , but we get the point already . what more is there to say if you're only making a cinematic sermon for the choir ? it's a risky endeavor -- you might find people chastising you for not making racism obviously bad _enough_ -- but it's the most potentially compelling . for all its flaws , american history x grabs you because it throws you inside the racist mind more effectively than any film i can remember . the center of that exploration is edward norton's creepy-smart performance as derek vinyard , a young skinhead we meet in two incarnations . those flashback sequences are by far the most effective , photographed by director tony kaye in icy black-and-white . remarkably , they begin from the premise that derek and danny are both intelligent rather than red-neck morons . derek is chilling because he's not merely spewing bile and epithets -- he's making racism _make sense_ like a master rhetorician . it's that kind of audience-baiting that makes portions of american history x so disturbing , particularly in a neighborhood basketball game sequence where kaye masterfully manipulates viewers into siding with derek and his skinhead cronies . the second shows us the reason for derek's incarceration -- the murder of two black carjackers -- in a moment more shocking than you might think movies can be any more . norton is perhaps at his most brilliant in this sequence ; his raised eyebrows of triumph as he is being arrested may be the most memorable single moment of screen acting this year . it's hard to imagine american history x ever getting made without the redemption/salvation angle , but it would have been much stronger without it . even more unnecessary is the contrived device in which danny is forced to write a history paper on derek's road to ruin , leading to a resolution that feels disappointingly pat . there's a grand sense of shakesepearean tragedy to the conclusion , but not nearly the intensity of emotion present as we're pulled into derek's racist world . we get that racism is bad . american history x works because it risks showing us why some people believe it's good . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
as sally explains to her customer exactly why he can no longer have it his way , you might suspect that home fries will follow our plucky , unconventional heroine on her search for independence and true love through the world of greasy dining -- home fried green tomatoes , or something of the sort . the kind of quirky humor home fries deals out can easily become oppressive if not directed with a sure hand . first-time feature director dean parisot seems to know just how to drop the peculiar into a scene without pointing at it for you and slapping your knee . henry's wake features zamfir's pan flute rendition of " you light up my life . " and the sequence of most profound bonding between our two young lovers occurs at a natural childbirth class where the instructor tells her students " you didn't get into this with your legs closed , and you won't get out of it that way . " it's all consistently off-beat in a way that's more often refreshing than just plain weird , but it also comes with an undercurrent of sincerity . luke wilson -- deadpan in an " aw shucks " -appealing kind of way -- does a nice job with dorian's ambivalence over his bizarre family dynamics and his attraction to sally's sweet ( relative ) normalcy . there's something almost touching to the convoluted family tree dorian describes for sally's baby , since it comes with the hope that the next generation will somehow be less screwed up than the last . it's too bad that home fries concludes with an overwrought helicopter-car chase that feels ridiculously out of place . it's also too bad that drew barrymore can't make sally more interesting as the object of everyone's love or hate , her character slipping in and out of focus like her generically southern accent . ultimately , the story isn't even really about her . not exactly the stuff of a folksy , girl-appeal comedy-drama , is it ? see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : nora ephron and delia ephron . director : nora ephron . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) . running time : 118 minutes . notwithstanding its tres-90s-hip cyber-era premise -- two email chat pals fall in love online , little realizing they already know and dislike each other in the real world -- you've got mail is a very old-fashioned sort of romantic comedy . it's not just that the film is a spin on the 1940 ernst lubitsch comedy the shop around the corner . actually , it's more about the lead actors . sometimes a romance isn't about a concept , or a romance between characters . sometimes it's about a romance between stars . you've got mail is about a romance between tom hanks and meg ryan . mind you , they do play characters in the film . you've got mail does manage to do an effective job of poking into the appeal and the problems of online interactions . at the same time , ephron and sister delia use variations on the idea that " it's not personal " to show how easy it is disconnect real people from the way we encounter them , whether in the flesh or after a cursor . trust this writer -- who met his wife online , and knows whereof he speaks -- that the ephrons get their subject right , right down to the embarrassment of people involved in the love that dare not type its username . yet even this thematic material is little more than a pleasant fringe benefit , because you've got mail is first and foremost a chance to watch two incredibly engaging performers together . it only takes a few moments watching hanks and ryan together to realize what sleepless in seattle , for all its storybook charms , was missing : hanks and ryan together . here they bicker and banter , bond warily , and generally offer delights for all who watch . you've got mail's final half hour is an improvement over the shop around the corner in that it sets a stronger foundation for the rapproachment to come , but it also means plenty of time to enjoy the chemistry between the two stars . hanks is playing hanks ( smart , funny and too-nice-for-words ) , ryan is playing ryan ( smart , funny and too-cute-for-words ) , and it doesn't even matter that they're not trying very hard to create distinctive characters . ephron just gives them clever things to say , and gets out of the way . it's nice to see ephron show some comic instinct again after the ineptitude of michael and mixed nuts , but even here there's a fair amount of flab in her film-making . much of the first hour of you've got mail feels very inefficient , but fortunately ephron saves the best for last . even as the film creeps up on the two hour mark , it's unlikely to lose viewer interest , because that's when hanks and ryan shine brightest . you've got mail is a celebrity-powered wish-fulfillment , and that's okay . sometimes it's enjoyable just watching nice things happen to nice people , even if the nice people involved happen to be movie stars . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
director : anand tucker . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 121 minutes . from its opening minutes , hilary and jackie promises intriguing spins on a couple of time-worn dramatic set-ups : the competitive siblings , and the tortured artistic genius . director anand tucker's adaptation of hilary's memoir ( co-written with brother piers ) introduces some provocative questions regarding how and why a prodigy becomes an artist . jackie's success surpasses hilary's not through superior inate talent , it is suggested , but through superior effort , exemplifying the 99% perspiration in that aphorism about what makes genius . if tucker and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce had explored the siblings' relationship as effectively as they explore their respective careers , hilary and jackie might have been a brilliant film . as it stands , it's a pretty good one which offers wildly disparate insight into its two main characters . there's a spark of curiosity as jackie makes an incredible request of her sister , but we never get a clear enough sense of why hilary grants that request . it's a great performance as a great character , yet it's disappointing that we watch her interact with her cello nearly as much as she interacts with hilary . though jackie's sense of isolation is the theme of the film's second half , it doesn't allow us to understand what these two women were to each other . hilary and jackie is a revelation when it allows us to see what people surrender for art , as well as why people surrender their art . as a family affair , it's more labor than genius . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : thomas vinterberg and mogens rukov . director : thomas vinterberg . mpaa rating : unrated ( could be r for adult themes , nudity and profanity ) running time : 101 minutes . more to the point , it's a family that makes you feel better about your own unhappy family . that's the kind of character truth " dogma '95 " -- a manifesto for a return to bare bones filmmaking created by several leading danish directors -- was supposed to engender . yet at times the celebration feels forced and artificial , merely in a different way than the forced and artifical genre films implicitly criticized by dogma '95 . others feel silly , like the machinations of the family cook to help air the dirty laundry . but good or bad , all the reactions spring from a bombshell rather than the typical exchanges of small artillery that make for most family tension . it all seems terribly unnecessary considering how perceptively vinterberg and co-scripter mogens rukov capture the more mundane animosity and foolishness of family gatherings . vinterberg and his exceptional cast -- thomas bo larsen is particularly good as the younger son overflowing with toxic anger -- find moments of greatness in these simple conflicts . indeed , vinterberg's point may have been that the more extreme example of family crisis that supercedes the others is more common than we'd like to believe . if so , it still feels like an authenticity that draws too much attention to itself . curiously , the same could be said for the rigid film-making prescriptions of the dogma '95 . the hand-held camerawork , washed-out video-to-film cinematography , location shooting and absence of underscore music were intended to subsume " auteurism " in favor of story , but they simply become an auteurism of a different sort . as effectively as the location serves to intensify the claustrophobia of a family forced to confront its demons , the look and sound of the celebration -- or lack thereof -- just make you aware of how different this film looks and sounds than other films , exactly when the familiarity of the situations should come into focus . some might argue the same was true of the most notable previous dogma '95 effort , lars von trier's breaking the waves . yet in that film , the style supported the instability of the main character's world ; thematically , the look was of a piece with the story . in the celebration , that same look works far less effectively , because it feels like an exercise rather than a choice . when vinterberg nails the truth of basic family interaction , it's easy to overlook that exercise . later , when a dramatic plot point takes over , it starts to seem that too much has been imposed on these characters from without -- a bad dogma starts to run over all its great karma . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
director : brian helgeland . lots of action films go the anti-hero route , offering protagonists with single-sentence motivations who kill at least as many people as the ostensible villains of the piece . the assumption is that we'll be on the side of the star because . . . well , it doesn't matter how nasty or brutal arnold schwarzenegger or steven seagal get -- if they're the first name on the marquee , they're the ones whose gunplay and fisticuffs are cheered . mel gibson is a different case entirely . there has always been something genuinely unstable behind his eyes when he wants there to be -- mad max , the original lethal weapon , conspiracy theory -- but also something genuinely wounded that makes his instability as sympathetic as it is menacing . along the way to his goal , porter encounters plenty of intriguing characters , which is half the fun of payback . payback works in large part because it's not just mel gibson running around shooting and getting shot at . the whole atmosphere of the film is bleak and corrupt , from ericson core's bleached cinematography to the cold brick of richard hoover's production design . though it comes with a dose of humor , it's usually humor of the black variety , and the film rarely strays far from pulp crime thriller territory . there's violence , and then there's _violence_ , and then there's payback , which never shies away from the roughest rough stuff from the opening scene of un-anesthetized surgery . where a slap might suffice , a pistol-whipping shows up instead ; where you might expect a good old-fashioned roughing up , you can count on the strategic application of a sledgehammer . porter's world is certainly a brutal one , and porter himself is a brutal guy , but after a while it all starts to feel like overkill . you reach the point where you don't need to see val beat up a woman and shoot a dog to figure out that he's not too nice a guy . fortunately , it all comes back to gibson , whose monomania about his $70 , 000 makes just enough sense to keep the plot moving . there's a bit too much effort directed towards making porter seem sensitive through his relationship with a high-priced call girl ( maria bello ) -- apparently the result of gibson's initial dissatisfaction with director and co-writer brian helgeland's relentlessly dark tone -- but it all seems like unnecessary effort . payback only works as entertainment because gibson himself conveys all the reason we need to get behind porter . if you can get past all the bloodshed and brutality , you'll find a surprisingly slick and surprisingly smart action thriller in payback . the amazing thing is that , by all rights , you _shouldn't_ be able to get past it . credit gibson for giving us the kind psycho you can't help cuddling up to . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : joao emanuel carneiro and marcos bernstein . director : walter salles . some day soon , i'm going to put together a list of the most over-used premises in film history , the ones which describe the entire story arc in a single sentence . to be fair , and to recognize that certain plots become canonical for valid thematic reasons , i'll even try to note examples of each that managed to add a spark of originality . such stories usually begin with characters that are crusty but identifiably loveable , making the journey little more than a waiting game until the resident adorable tyke trims off the crust . dora , on the other hand , is a fairly grim piece of work . fernanda montenegro uses her wonderfully weathered face to create dora as a grandmotherly con artist , and not the kind of devilishly adorable con artist justified in most films by the fact that he or she steals robin hood-like from the rich . it's eventually obvious that central station is about dora's quest for her own father more than it is about her quest for josue's father , but that's exactly what gives the familiar story more thematic weight . the cute bonding moments between dora and josue are few and far between , allowing director walter salles to concentrate on the fact that the journey changes dora more than the child does . for most of the film , her anti-social personality feels completely genuine , not in the least like a device for an uplifting conclusion . inevitably , though , central station has got to reach its uplifting conclusion . and it is only when that happens that central station feels false , even though the change is necessary in order for it to be dramatically satisfying . montenegro is a deft enough actress to limit the burden of schmaltz , but she can't change the fact that the script tells her that , by god , she's going to learn important lessons . central station is still a good film , satisfying for three-quarters of its length as a character study . there's just no way it can escape completely the conventions of its single-sentence story . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
director : joe johnston . mpaa rating : pg ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 108 minutes . october sky is a tough sort of film to get people to look at clearly . touted in its marketing campaign as " inspirational " and " triumphant " -- usually code words for " sentimental " and " heavy-handed " -- it could easily lead more cynical movie-goers to dismiss it sight unseen as mawkish foolishness . others , of a more feel-good nature , will think they have seen a great film simply because , well , it makes them feel good . it's hard for both potential sets of viewers to get a handle on why october sky works -- it avoids most of the traps the former group fears , while delivering the satisfying emotional resonance the latter group desires . this , of course , is the cue to begin your typical triumph of the spirit , winning-against-the-odds , kids-wiser-than-their parents crowd-pleaser . in some ways , the elements in october sky are quite typical : a determined young hero , societal obstacles , a big climax at a competitive event . yet there are enough ways october sky is _not_ typical to make it surprisingly effective . director joe johnston , best known for special effects-driven films like jumanji and the rocketeer , lends energy and humor to the montage of failed initial attempts at rocket flight . the production creates a complete , convincing picture of its small-town world , treating its characters with a clear-eyed realization that they're neither simple hicks nor salt-of-the-earth country folk . and there's something fundamentally , unconventionally appealing about a film where teenagers are obsessed with an intellectual pursuit , a film where the protagonist proves his innocence of a suspected crime by using a mathematical formula . it is also unconventionally appealing to see a father-son relationship treated with such sensitivity and intelligence . certainly it helps that an actor as subtly gifted as chris cooper is playing john hickam . too many actors would have made him a gruff thick-head who converts to understanding just in time for a big hug ; cooper makes john's stubbornness both caring and slightly dismissive of a boy acting smarter than his own pa . jake gyllenhaal is equally enjoyable as homer , making his fascination with rocket science an expression of his desire to explore the universe beyond coalwood . the interactions between john and homer form october sky's emotional backbone , and nearly every one of them is pitched at a level of conflict which seems honest rather than movie-conflict shrill . there are a number of occasions when october sky does begin to feel like its more convention-bound cousins . there is an obligatory romantic sub-plot for homer which appears and disappears so quickly that there hardly seems to be a point ; an illness experienced by homer's favorite teacher ( laura dern ) , while historically accurate , further bogs down the narrative . the last half-hour of october sky is not nearly as well-paced as the first hour , dragging out homer's journey to the national science fair , but that doesn't detract from the film's many pleasures . october sky is inspirational , and it is triumphant ; it's also smart , well-written , and well-acted . this one shows that feel-good movies don't also have to be feel-dumb movies . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : guy ritchie . director : guy ritchie . it's tough to knock a film as undeniably invigorating as lock , stock and two smoking barrels without coming off as an impossible-to-please crank . yes , it's generally funny , clever and unpredictable ; true , it's plotted with a precision that should make aspiring screenwriters take notes ; indeed , it has visual style to spare . guy ritchie's caper/comedy/thriller has a savage entertainment value that's awfully hard to find anymore . it's also a film without an ounce of humanity , a narrative machine where the fun feels hollow because the characters come with names and virtually nothing more . that's a problem that really only nags in hindsight , since you'll spend all your viewing time just trying to keep up . believe it or not , that's the simple part of the multi-layered plotting in lock , stock and two smoking barrels . there are plenty of occasions during the first half of the film when it feels over-populated , over-plotted and over-directed , sending situations , vertiginous camera angles and new faces at the audience in overwhelming waves . only ritchie's appealing wit might keep you from throwing up your hands and throwing in the towel . fortunately , the second and third acts offer so much propulsive action that forgiveness for the early excesses becomes fairly easy . ritchie manages to pull all these threads together quite deftly , creating a series of confrontations which continuously whip up new permutations of violence , dark humor and surprise . there are missteps here as well -- including a depiction of the protagonists' celebrating an apparent victory which resembles a drinking binge by the monkees -- but the caper itself is engrossing enough to help hide them . lock , stock and two smoking barrels blindsides you with its sheer momentum , the pieces falling into place so rapidly that you can't help but admire ritchie's audacity . it's considerably harder to admire his thoroughgoing lack of interest in his characters except as gun-toting props . every bit of color in the film's performances comes from the use of physical types -- the bald , imposing barry ; the short , high-strung rory ; strapping but soft-spoken big chris . quentin tarantino often is credited with inspiring a slew of nihilistic comic-crime imitators , but tarantino's way with actors and redemption-hungry characters has always given him away as a closet humanist , and has always tempered his infamous violent streak . you can't knock a director in 1999 who at least makes you want to watch . you just wish this rowdy bit of entertainment made you want to care about something , anything , besides how many bodies will pile up before the credits roll . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
forces of nature ( dreamworks ) starring : sandra bullock , ben affleck , maura tierney , steve zahn , blythe danner , ronny cox , stephen schiff . screenplay : marc lawrence . producers : susan arnold , donna arkoff roth and ian bryce . director : bronwen hughes . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , drug use ) running time : 105 minutes . i relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can make me feel like a fool . i spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage , grousing to myself about its transparently planes , trains and automobiles plot machinations , and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement . this was a mass market romantic comedy , after all , a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and , even in its best days , worked hard to perpetuate the romance = infatuation paradigm . then marc lawrence did something wonderful , something which made the entire film click into place : he showed me a comic love story about grown-ups . forces of nature gets off to a solid enough start , setting up the characters and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue . sandra bullock , for her part , is more loose and appealing than she has been in her last half-dozen films combined , avoiding her recent habit of playing any semblance of character depth as moping . the two performances -- part of a great top-to-bottom cast -- are effective and connected from the start , yet the script's apparent sympathy with the marital horror stories ben hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completely . lively and funny though it may be on a consistent basis , forces of nature leaves a bitter taste that feels like self-justification . the kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactly the opposite purpose , leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution . forces of nature isn't about a man developing a fear of commitment ; it's about a man learning what commitment means _to him_ , learning that it's not what he thought it was . lawrence's script feints and dodges before reaching its happy ending , an ending which is happy because people make the choices that make the most sense . earlier scenes that might have felt like throwaways take on more resonance , and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh and genuine . though one too many plot contrivances keep ben and sarah together through the film , and they do exchange the obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples , forces of nature wraps up so perfectly that you'll end up remembering the humor and the simple wisdom . that is , provided you're not put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes . for a brisk romantic comedy , forces of nature comes loaded with some of the most over-directed scenes of the year : teetering hand-held shots , why-not low or high angles , sweeping pans . occasionally the hyper-real approach works , with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance ; far more often , hughes refuses to let a scene be what it is , covering it with flourishes so thick you almost can't find what's underneath . a script this smart and mature deserved a more restrained director , but even hughes' excesses can't spoil this unique concoction . forces of nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something with the power to enchant , something that can make you happy to be proved wrong when you expect a tale for and about adolescents . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : ken scarborough , based on characters created by jim jinkins . director : maurice joyce . mpaa rating : g . running time : 77 minutes . there are two basic kinds of " family films " that come to your local multiplex . in one category are those that genuinely deserve the name " family film , " the kind that can actually keep an adult entertained while remaining appropriate for kids . in the other category are the generally inspid , generally tv-based tales made exclusively for non-discriminating sub-teens . with no experience of the television series on which it was based , i went into doug's 1st movie expecting the latter . instead , i found something halfway between the two : a good-natured , good-humored kids' film that actually treated young viewers as though they had intelligence . the plot for doug's 1st movie returns to some recurring threads from the " doug " show which originated on nickelodeon before moving to abc saturday mornings . should he risk derision by helping herman and taking on mr . bluff , or focus on staying in patti's good graces ? in fact , it's not really much of a dilemma at all . doug is the nicest of nice guys , an easy guy for his peers to relate to . like most adolescents , he's a little insecure , but he always tries hard to do the right thing . that's the basic , simple appeal of doug's 1st movie : it's a message movie for kids in which the message is " be decent , " and where the message isn't obscured by special effects or infantilism . sure , it moves at a fairly pokey cartoon pace , but that's a welcome respite from animated films that behave as though kids will only sit still for frantic action . parents may even be sitting still for some of the funny asides in doug's 1st movie . though ken scarborough's script is hardly heavy on adult references , it does feel slightly smarter than most cartoon scripts . i don't think a single line in the film would be over the head of a 12-year-old , yet somehow i still felt in on the joke despite the fact that most of the humor centered on schoolkid types ( the whiz-kid nerds , the stuck-up rich girl , the minor-league bully and his cronies ) . the best point of comparison for doug's 1st movie is probably the " peanuts " television specials and features of the late 60s and 1970s -- they were both sincere and engaging , and easy for families to share . doug may not stand " peanuts' " test of time , but it's a solid choice for parents who like the idea of a film that doesn't condescend to their kids . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
our collective existential/millennial/y2k-bug angst now has been channelled officially into one cinematic premise : the line between reality and virtual reality is growing too thin for comfort , and cyberspace is intruding on our personal space . though the marketing campaign ( and official web site ) teases us with the cryptic question " what is the matrix ? " , it wouldn't be giving anything away to say that it's something you'll be seeing a lot of over the next few months . we'll all be fortunate if what we see is as kinetically entertaining as the matrix . if that description seems a bit coy , it's only because part of the fun in the first half of the matrix is allowing its bizarre cosmology to unfold . though there's plenty of exposition required to explain what's going on in the matrix , the wachowskis manage to do it with a wink and a smile , investing the expository segments with wit and imagination . the film's first hour is somewhat slow going , yet even while waiting for it to gain momentum there's a certain confidence that it will . and boy , does it ever . the action sequences in the matrix are some of the best in a long time , combining wicked visual effects ( familiar to those who've seen any gap commercials lately ) with creative choreography . fully aware that they're dealing physics of their own invention , the wachowskis let loose with both barrels , sending the matrix over-the-top and into the realm of video game excess . amazingly , it almost never feels like a video-game movie , thanks mostly to the wachowskis' sure-handed pacing but also to some ingenious casting . the matrix is a blast , but it's never a dumb blast . there are plenty of places where it feels like the matrix could have been tidied up a bit -- a lengthy chase here , a pointless romantic angle there , a conversation about why everything tastes like chicken over there -- to bring the running time down below two hours . it's the kind of movie that will turn off plenty of viewers , either because of its violence , its convoluted story or its pokiness in getting to the good stuff . others will see the matrix as the kind of film that makes use of action and special effects instead of being used by them , the kind of film that takes that extra moment to turn its big showdown into a classic spaghetti western confrontation . if virtual reality is the flavor of the month , plug me in to something like the matrix , and give me a world where the adventure is worth two hours of my time . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
producers : leslie urdang and michael hoffman . director : michael hoffman . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , brief nudity ) running time : 115 minutes . the cinematic cynic in me suspects that the lofty , unwieldy title of william shakespeare's a midsummer night's dream has as much to do with timely marketing as it does with a nod to literary fidelity . after all , when adults are flocking to the oscar-winning shakespeare in love and teens are catching " the taming of the shrew " turned into 10 things i hate about you , the bard would seem to be riding a unique wave of cross-demographic hipness . to that extent , this midsummer night is truly william shakespeare's in its mix of disparate elements , with all the delights and potential pitfalls that accompany them . at its most basic level , a midsummer night's dream is a precursor to bedroom farce without the slamming doors ( doors being hard to come by in the forest ) . as the enchanted lovers become a circle of frustration -- lysander is made to love helena , who still loves demetrius , who still loves hermia , who still loves lysander -- saucy exchanges alternate with good old-fashioned female mud wrestling . it takes more than a little while for the film to find its pacing , hindered by the atypically awkward work of strathairn , but once the pleasantly low-tech , stage-set world of the forest becomes the focus , the high and low comedy both begin working . it's an interesting interpretation , but one that doesn't always mesh with the other players . the other major sub-plot becomes both a midsummer night dream's high point and its source of greatest disappointment . unfortunately , hoffman doesn't exploit kline's performance for all it can offer , never really delivering a satisfying resolution to the character he has set up . the bumbling performance is pure slapstick -- malapropped lines , misaligned props , over-the-top acting and , to quote shakespeare in love , a bit with a dog . it's a sweet note on which to end a play of sometimes discordant tones , perhaps making this dream seem less uneven that it should . the course of this tale about the course of true love never does run smooth ; it merely offers a fanciful comedy deserving enough of the author's name . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
perspective is a curious matter . sometimes , a thing is entirely how you look at it rather than the thing itself . even in the mind , style can triumph over substance . there is an abundance of style on display in three seasons , enough to cloak its lapses in substance . the narrative consists of four largely independent stories of life in modern saigon . visually , three seasons is a remarkably assured piece of film-making , using the contrasts of ancient , war-time and modern vietnam to perfection . cinematographer lisa rinzler captures flower-showered streets and lotus gardens with a warm glow , helping make three seasons an often enchanting tone poem on the conflicts inherent in introducing the contemporary into the conventional . as a narrative , it's considerably more inconsistent , as one might expect from the multiple independent story-lines . by far the most effective is the tale of cyclo driver hai , given the strongest emotional and thematic pull by don duong's exceptional performance . at its core his is a tried-and-true hooker with a heart of gold story , yet something in duong's manner makes the cliche more resonant , his attempts to " save " lan more ennobling than predictable . each of the other tales has its moments , but they come more sporadically . keitel's american perspective feels particularly intrusive , almost like a sop to american audiences ; what's more , it adds a title-confounding fourth story to the three seasons . though three seasons rarely inspires seat-shifting , it's never as engaging as it is when the focus is on hai . still , the stories do ultimately come together as tales of healing , of reconciling vietnam's troubled past with its challenging present and future . as the first american production shot in vietnam since the war , it's also an often-compelling cultural document . there's little doubt that three seasons feels somehow more " significant " because it is so gracefully and beautifully composed , but that's hardly a cause for consternation . if it pushes plenty of the right aesthetic buttons , that only proves that glamour can change one's perspective , as it clearly has in a post-war saigon where coke adds life . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
tom tykwer's run lola run is pure cinema at its most maddening and invigorating . few films this year will leave viewers as charged from experiencing the film medium in the hands of someone who knows how to use it ; few films this year pack so much reckless energy into a tight 81 minutes . and few films this year not directed by george lucas will put more effort into telling a tale about people who don't really matter as characters . run lola run is a giddy exercise in overkill combining splendid bursts of audacity with a largely " who cares " narrative . if manni and money are not at the designated pickup spot at noon sharp the same day , manni is almost certainly a dead man . the crux of tykwer's premise is showing us three alternate fates for lola and manni based on those caprices of chance . it's a gimmick that allows him to turn a short film into a feature , but it works better than you have any reason to expect . each segment comes with at least one surprising twist , the kind of detail that shows tykwer's rare talent for being ingenious without being self-congratulatory about his ingenuity . the most surprising twist of all may be the welcome flippancy in his gloss on the usually heavy topics of fate and chance . his best-executed running gag involves staccato , freeze-frame asides in each segment showing how lola's encounters with complete strangers -- changed by a matter of seconds in each variation -- change those peripheral lives as well . tykwer uses his marginalia better than many filmmakers use the entire page . often , however , it's all just a bit . . . much . the collisons of animation , video , still images and film seem to exist as much because they can as for any practical reason ; surrealist touches like lola's ability to shatter glass with a scream are more befuddling distraction than artistic nuance . all the busy-ness of tykwer's business does an effective job of distracting from just how emotionally weightless it all is . the quiet interpersonal moments between lola and manni , inserted between the alternate reality segments , should have been striking for the insight they provide . instead , they're striking because they're about the only chance you have to catch your breath . still , it's hard to resist a film that maintains such a relentless pace and squeezes so much pleasure from such a simple concept . it's also hard to resist the charisma of franka potente , the wild-eyed star whose furiously pumping legs fuel run lola run . if there had been the hint of a person behind that personality , run lola run could have been sheer brilliance . even without that strong human story , it's still the sort of action-packed crowd-pleaser that makes so many blockbusters look so sadly bloated . the sheer momentum of tykwer's techno-pop-pulsing direction makes the film an entertaining jolt to the system , even if it's all ultimately auteurist eye candy . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : tab murphy and bob tzudiker & noni white , based on the novel _tarzan of the apes_ by edgar rice burroughs . directors : kevin lima and chris buck . mpaa rating : g ( adult themes ) running time : 85 minutes . the opening ten minutes of disney's tarzan represent as gripping and mature an example of animated film-making as i've ever seen . that dark , dazzling prologue works not only on its own dramatic terms , but also at shifting expectations -- perhaps tarzan could stand on its own as more than re-cycled motifs from the jungle book and the lion king . tarzan continues disney's impressive streak in recent years of incorporating more serious themes into its animated features . there are moments when it's easy to forget you're watching a film marketed at kids , from the effective interpersonal moments ( energized by driver's charming vocal performance ) to the twist on the obligatory musical numbers that turns most of them into transitional bridges . the animation itself feels more grown-up , even when the flashy " deep canvas " technology turns a trek through the trees into a ready-made theme park ride . where its animated features are concerned -- and its live-action kid flicks , notoriously , are not -- it's clear disney genuinely cares about creating complete , resonant stories . it's also clear that disney cares plenty about making sure the cash cow isn't cut just for the prime rib audience . there are kids' club burgers to be sold as well , which means comic relief that's a relief only when it goes away . both characters , plush-toy cute though they may be , feel like tacked-on creations contributing a slapstick silliness the story just doesn't need ; the pointless show-stopper " trashin' the camp " in particular seems to belong in another film entierly . even the nasty clayton is out of place , adding an external conflict only because tradition has dictated it . there's nothing wrong with disney making purely amusing kiddie fare like hercules and aladdin . there's also nothing wrong with letting the deeper stories be deep . the issue isn't whether tarzan should have been plodding and somber , because it's clear that the core narrative could provide all the entertainment a viewer of any age could want . there's plenty of humor in the interactions between tarzan and jane , and plenty of adventure in tarzan's various encounters with jungle beasts . tarzan is a solid film , stronger in its basic filmmaking elements than most wide-release films , but it might have been a spectacular one instead . disney will never go broke relying on the successful disney animated formula , and they'll continue to turn out largely enjoyable family films . they'll also have trouble breaking free to make a stirring , utterly unique animated film , one that fulfills the potential of tarzan's magnificent first ten minutes . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : david mamet , based on the play by terence rattigan . director : david mamet . mpaa rating : g running time : 100 minutes . depending upon one's point of view , the winslow boy is either as unlikely a piece of material as one could expect from david mamet or a perfect fit in the mamet oeuvre . certainly it's surprising to find mamet directing a script by another writer , even more surprising to find the ultra-contemporary mamet directing a period piece , and more surprising yet to find the profanity-happy mamet directing a g-rated script . there's also something perfectly mamet-like in the film's themes of people seeking the truth of things behind the formalized dance of conversation . mamet isn't straying far from comfortable ground , but he strays far enough to find an intriguing new perspective on film-making . the winslow boy may be his finest work as a film director , perhaps because he's working from a less tightly-controlled script . a contemporary movie-goer might expect the winslow boy to turn into a courtroom drama , chock full of witness stand backpedaling and banging gavels . rattigan's text is more concerned with subtler matters than the melodrama of legal confrontations , including issues still resonant fifty years after the play's debut . the story also attacks the casual dismissal of pursuits of justice , not on the basis of right or wrong , but on the basis of how annoying it is to have normalcy disrupted . as thought-provoking as the winslow boy may be , however , it's often far too sedate in its interpersonal relationships . the characters in the winslow boy face consequences for their choices , but the choices are more interesting to rattigan than those consequences . there's a merchant ivory vibe to the repressed emotions without the merchant ivory readiness to show the intensity behind them . mamet has never been known for his emotionalism , but the fault here appears to lie far more with rattigan . indeed , mamet takes some of the simplest scenes and charges them with more feeling than they might deserve ( notably arthur's demand of honesty from ronnie ) . he has always been a remarkably efficient film director , and the winslow boy certainly doesn't stray in that regard . hawthorne is brilliant , northam is appropriately enigmatic , and even rebecca pidgeon seems vaguely human . there's little mamet can do with the huge chunks of dialogue involving exposition of off-stage events , or to fill in the spaces between the people , but he does a lot with a story that's more conceptual than actual . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : trey parker & matt stone and pam brady . director : trey parker . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , adult humor , cartoon violence , sexual situations ) running time : 81 minutes . south park : bigger , longer & uncut is crude and profane . it's more-than-occasionally offensive . it's naughty just to see how much naughtiness you can get away with . it's repetitious in its dependence on obscenity from the mouths of babes . this is about as vile and inexcusable as comedy film-making gets , a distillation of everything people fear popular culture is doing to our sensibilities , and i laughed so hard i thought i'd harm an internal organ . there's no question that " south park " is for a very specific taste , or lack thereof . even those who had been embracing the series now seem to have tired of trey parker and matt stone's crass market approach to grabbing laughs , as evidenced by the show's plummeting ratings . bigger , longer & uncut's missed jokes and sniggering immaturity probably wouldn't surprise even the staunchest " south park " fan ; its sporadic brilliance may surprise everyone . the premise is a reflexive commentary on " harmful " film-making , with the show's four young pals -- eric cartman ( parker ) , stan marsh ( parker ) , kyle broflovski ( stone ) and kenny mccormick ( stone ) -- learning some interesting words from an r-rated feature film starring scatalogical cartoon stars terrance & phillip . the children's profane outbursts cause a parental panic in which terrance & phillip's home nation of canada is held accountable for many societal ills . the broad pot-shots at censorship and moralistic hysteria aren't surprising coming from parker and stone , who have been heralded as harbingers of the apocalypse themselves . they get in a few swipes at the mpaa ( which branded parker's orgazmo with an nc-17 ) , taking particular aim at the greater concern with vulgarity than with violence . the target may be easy and some of the jokes obvious , but parker and stone keep the chuckles coming at the expense of those who would condemn them . as it turns out , the film is far less effective as social satire than it is at pop culture parody . you see , bigger , longer & uncut is a musical , with many of the numbers by parker and composer marc shaiman patterned after the recent disney formula . parker and stone then switch gears to target les miserables , as the children's " la resistance " movement opposing their parents' proposed execution of terrance & phillip generates numbers keyed to " one day more " and " a little fall of rain . " the fifteen songs provide the film's most riotous moments , including terrance & phillip's explosively obscene ode to molestation and satan's tender ballad about his quest for happiness . you may never feel guiltier about laughing harder . a style like parker and stone's , similar to scattershot predecessors like mel brooks and the zucker-abrahams-zucker team , is bound to produce its share of duds like the go-nowhere jabs at a perpetually horny saddam hussein . many viewers will just be turned off by the use of homosexuality or military racism as punch lines , or even the whole idea of easily-influenced kids in today's charged post-columbine high climate . south park : bigger , longer & uncut isn't going to make anyone prouder to be an american , or any less convinced that movies are all about shock value . it's not even going to earn points for preaching to the choir about letting parents do the job of parenting . it may do nothing more than leave you choking back the laughs for fear of acknowledging the power of your inner 12-year-old . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
you have to know what you can expect from writer david e . kelley -- and what you _can't_ expect -- to have a chance of enjoying the determinedly quirky lake placid . he delights in creating eccentric characters , giving them outrageous things to say , and hoping that our amusement and affection for those characters will carry us through stories where his main goal is making a social statement . this isn't a master of plotting we're talking about here . if you can swing with kelley's off-beat sense of humor , you're in good shape ; if not , you're in for a long night of eye-rolling and teeth-grinding . for lake placid , his first thriller , kelley abandons the social commentary entirely to give his goofy characters plenty of room to work , in a genre where plotting isn't particularly vital . the result is an occasionally hilarious insult comedy only occasionally interrupted by a monster movie . the combination of tightly-wound urbanites and laconic locals provides most of the comic fodder in lake placid . when it works , it works wonderfully , particularly when platt and gleeson square off . platt always shines when given the role of the big-mouth , making him an ideal actor for kelley's tart zingers . gleeson , meanwhile , lends keough a restraint and dignity you wouldn't expect from a character who's a skeet for put-downs . movie-goers who can enjoy a film simply by revelling in quotable lines , including a sly shot at woody allen's infamous " the heart wants what the heart wants " comment , are in for a real treat those expecting something akin to an actual thriller , on the other hand , are in for a disappointment . the first hour of lake placid includes a couple of graphic dismemberments and a few animal carcases , but not much else in the way of scares . in fact , the entire premise generally seems like an excuse to put these four characters in the same place and let them snipe at each other . and as clever as kelley's writing can be , it's distracting when he calls attention to his own cleverness ( a notion to which any number of " ally mcbeal " detractors can attest ) , or grows infatuated with the lack of restrictions on an r-rated film's dialogue . lake placid is basically a one-type-of-joke film . how quickly one tires of that one type of joke will go a long way towards determining one's enjoyment . fortunately , kelley and director steve miner don't give that joke much chance to grow tired , wrapping up the proceedings in a tidy 80 minutes . that includes a corker of a conclusion , with more tension and narrow escapes in five minutes than in the rest of the film combined . the climax is almost enough to fool you into thinking lake placid was actually a thriller , instead of a farcical comedy with expensive mechanical reptiles . kelley has already proven himself a writer for very specific tastes , and lake placid isn't a tremendous stretch in his oeuvre . it is , however , very funny when it's supposed to be . you just have to be prepared for something unconventionally effective when the creator of " ally mcbeal " does jaws . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
after flaming out spectacularly in its last few attempts at feature animation -- gems like quest for camelot and the king and i -- warner bros . finally figured out how to guarantee a decent story : they re-made e . t . as a cartoon . technically , of course , that's not what the iron man is . on a fairly superficial level , the iron man is a cold war allegory about paranoia turned against anything unfamiliar . screenwriter tim mccanlies and director brad bird drop in little tidbits of period detail -- hogarth's fascination with radiation/mutation films , his friendship with a beatnik scrapyard owner/artist ( harry connick jr . ) -- but they don't really take full advantage of their setting . the decision to set the film in 1957 maine seems fairly arbitrary , especially since hughes' book was not . a bit more successful is the thematic treatment of the giant as a weapon that learns how to be human . some viewers may shift in their seats at the " guns kill " message-mongering , but it's intriguing to see a family film tackling the notion of a sentient being accepting responsibility for its own moral choices , and finding heroism in the process . the iron giant ultimately does prove entertaining not because of its astute observations about 1950s america or gun control , but because it's a classic " boy and his dog " story -- e . t . the set-ups are familiar , but familiarity doesn't have to mean laziness . as directed by " the simpsons " and " king of the hill " veteran bird , the iron giant has a slightly subversive sense of humor and a lively pace , giving the oft-told tale its own unique spice . it's e . t . -lite , to be sure , but it still pushes the right buttons . on a technical level , the iron giant may not dazzle like some recent disney features . while the integration of the digitally-created giant and the conventionally-drawn characters is seamless , the backgrounds come out a bit flat and the colors somewhat muted . yet the toned-down animation may actually work to the iron giant's advantage . there's more innocence to the character design , more simple charm in the laid-back direction . i'm not sure the iron giant earns the big emotional crescendo it's looking for when hogarth finally stares skyward at the giant and says " i love you , " but the fundamental appeal of the relationship between a lonely boy and his alien puppy is always in effect . if it's true that there are no new stories to tell , the success of a film is always about the time the filmmakers invest in telling the old stories well . so e . t . you'll still probably be pulling for him to turn on his heartlight . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
movie people love making movies about movie people -- they validate film-making as the most fascinating of all pursuits , even as they allow tinseltown to tweak its own inflated image . it's a wonderful mystery of the film industry that so much self-absorption and self-loathing can co-exist without some sort of matter/anti-matter explosion . too often , though , the tweak doesn't take . steven seagal playing himself in my giant was unconvincing as a pompous , difficult star playing a pompous , difficult star ; burn hollywood burn was as brainless and misguided as the films it intended to satirize . for every the player , there are half a dozen attempts at insider humor too self-congratulatory to tap into what's truly goofy about hollywood . ramsey has no interest in the project , but bowfinger has a creative solution . little does bowfinger know that the strange things happening around kit are sending the already-edgy celebrity into a full-fledged paranoia . the key is that he knows how to do it with affection , finding the absurdity in film culture and conventions while still recognizing their magical appeal . in a sense , bowfinger is a broad , contemporary re-working of ed wood , the story of a guy so determined to make his mark that he'll go to bizarre lengths to do it . martin the actor lets go of his recent flustered everyman persona to find a guy willing to look ridiculous to be a player . the scattershot approach to hollywood satire should have fallen flat , and on occasion it does feel somewhat forced . director frank oz certainly deserves some credit for his deft touch , but the real anchor of bowfinger is eddie murphy . unlike seagal , murphy appears genuinely willing to poke fun at his history as holy terror . it's a wild , wired performance , complemented by his second role as jiff , the geeky kit ramsey look-alike bowfinger hires as a stand-in . jiff not only lets murphy subtly satirize his fondness for playing multiple roles ; he provides a sympathetic face for an innocent's sense of wonder at the world of the movies . murphy should always be this loose and entertaining . bowfinger isn't a perfect comedy , at times pushing its thin premise farther than it can sustain . heather graham's secretly machiavellian ingenue grows a bit tiresome , and the mindhead gags often feel timid and blunted . when the set pieces work , however -- jiff's terrified journey across a freeway , or an attempt to spook kit in a parking garage , or gathering a " crew " at the mexican border -- they're wonderfully funny stuff . it's also a movie about movies that doesn't get caught up in its own hipness . when steve martin wants you to laugh at something about hollywood , you know it's out of authentic whimsy , not a movie star's hypocritical attempt to cozy up to the laypeople . as a result , bowfinger feels relaxed and honest , a satire with enough wisdom to recognize there's still something delightful about being a film-maker . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : hirokazu koreeda . producers : masayuki akieda and shiho sato . director : hirokazu koreeda . mpaa rating : unrated ( adult themes ) running time : 118 minutes . hirokazu koreeda's after life is a film that stirs the imagination instantly -- which is fortunate , because the overflow of good will has to carry through an ill-conceived conclusion . the provocative premise combines the post-mortem bureaucracy of defending your life with a conversation from city slickers about the best days of one's life . the memories about which they speak are intriguing enough in their own right -- some with tales about childhood innocence , others with accounts of adult adventures -- to spark reflections by viewers about their own favored recollections . more intriguing still is after life's exploration of the nature of memory as a combination of things as they were and things as we wish they could have been . even the conceit of creating a film version of an imperfect memory -- rather than using the archived videotapes of people's lives available to the case workers -- emphasizes the power of filtered , romanticized remembrance . for over an hour , after life delights with reflections on what we remember and how we remember it , letting the steady stream of interviews flow over the loose narrative structure . in the course of helping watanabe -- who considers his life so mundane that there's not a moment worth remembering -- mochizuki struggles with unresolved issues from his own life . after spending most of the film as effective supporting players , the rosencrantzes and guildensterns of after life cold-cock this " hamlet " and make it all about them . there's nothing inherently wrong with a movie about the longings of otherworldly guides , unless you count the fact that it's already been done a few times . but after life shouldn't have been one of those movies , since it already had so much going for it as meditation on transcendent life experiences . there's a strange appeal to the production's heaven-as-low-budget-independent-film-set look , and plenty more appeal to the tales of the deceased . it's hard not to suspect that after life would have made an extraordinary documentary , since koreeda's steady , concentrated medium shots of the characters describing their memories are so effective . maybe then koreeda wouldn't have been tempted to leave the strengths of his film -- which are plenty strong -- for the supernatural melodrama of long-lost loves . in my memory , this one will linger as a good film that could have been great . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
producers : armyan bernstein and amy robinson . director : sam raimi mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , brief gore ) running time : 138 minutes . arguably his two strongest performances -- in two of his strongest films -- have come when he was dealing with baseball : bull durham , and field of dreams . there's something about costner , some combination of his convincingly athletic build and his aw-shucks , laconic manner that makes him well-suited to tales of our peculiarly mythologized national pastime . it's only natural that he'd want to return to the diamond for a film like for love of the game . could he maintain his perfect batting average , even playing a non-hitting american league pitcher ? the short answer is yes , though it's more of a solid single than field of dreams' ground-rule double or bull durham's inside-the-park home run . for love of the game is deftly constructed as perhaps the ideal date movie -- it's a love story that also happens to be a baseball movie . though costner is plenty agreeable in his easy-going way , it's preston who really sells the romantic side of the story . the chemistry between preston and costner is solid , but there's a nagging sense that there's much more to know about billy . the absence of any previous romantic history for billy robs the love story of context ; it's hard to see the person he was , so we can feel for the person he needs to become . some of that context is provided by the baseball sequences , which are satisfying in their own right . though there are a couple of technical blunders -- a scoreboard that shows no hits for both teams shortly before the announcer says the tigers have two hits -- the game sequences do their job as character development . still , it's sometimes difficult to lock into the fate of billy and jane's relationship , not because of the distractions of the game sequences , but because billy remains so enigmatic . in another sense , that mystery could simply be a distraction from a viewer's confidence that these two people actually belong together . make no mistake , for love of the game is fundamentally satisfying -- it can't help but be with _two_ big payoff scenes -- and well-acted . director sam raimi delivers the crowd-pleasing goods , and the film delivers more laughs than you might expect . i only wish billy chapel had been more of a complete character , and less one of those baseball icons costner has exploited so successfully in other films . it just could have been better . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
like cats and dogs , guinevere is a tale of a young woman's self-realization through photography ; also like cats and dogs , and much to its advantage , it's a story elevated by a radiant lead performance . it's almost too easy to use the film's title for emphasis , but it's also true : in a film that runs out of gas before it runs out of time , sarah polley shines like cinema royalty , making it far easier to overlook guinevere's tactical errors . there's no question that polley -- who dazzled in the sweet hereafter and stole the multi-character go -- is turning into one of the most gifted actresses of her generation . like janeane garofolo in the truth about cats and dogs , she makes insecurity genuinely affecting instead of merely affected , doing things with her mouth and her eyes that make your heart want to break . there is a scene involving connie's first sexual advances that has been played in any number of films with a soft-focus earnestness ; polley giggles and shifts with nervous energy , finding the awkwardness at the heart of initial intimacies . she is ably complemented by rea -- who takes an alcoholic lecher and manages to make him as sympathetic as he is slimy -- and jean smart -- a caustic delight as harper's mother . the tone grows unnecessarily " heavy , " turning a frisky coming-of-age piece into one of those " i was never the same after that summer stories . " while it's bitterly funny watching mrs . sloane dissect connie's motives , it provides too simple an explanation for the complex dynamics of a potentially interesting relationship , and ultimately shifts the balance of the film away from harper and towards connie . though wells' guinevere has a lot going for it in the way of sharp dialogue and finely crafted character moments , the film-maker stumbles when she doesn't realize that the best thing she's got going is polley . in this bright young actress's capable hands , this story of lessons in love earns solid marks . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
mpaa rating : unrated ( could be pg-13 for adult themes , profanity ) running time : 80 minutes . francis veber writes an interesting brand of farce . where most farce either soars or crashes , veber's occupies a little-seen middle ground : funny enough that people like it , but not so spectacular that it intimidates hollywood's remake-happy execs . " we can do this even better , " they quite reasonably say to themselves . the simple talent for being just entertaining enough suddenly doesn't seem quite so simple . set almost entirely in brochant's flat , the dinner game certainly feels like the stage play adaptation it is . occasionally , that means the film feels claustrophobic , with people waiting for phones to ring or doors to open . veber can be something of a minimalist farceur , his direction taking the blake edwards route of getting out of the way of comic situations rather than trying to contribute much to them visually . his best trick is cutting to stone-faced reaction takes by lhermitte and francis huster ( as brochant's pal ) , and his pacing isn't exactly spectacular , especially in an 80 minute film . by no means is this a film-maker without his flaws . there are punch lines in the dinner game that should be obvious from the moment they're a speck in the distance , yet somehow they still manage to zing . villeret's pignon is an exaggerated creation , to be sure , but his bizarre goofs are made endearing by his obvious desire to be liked ; he's like a great dane who wags his tail so hard he knocks over everything around him . the dinner game generates some big-time laughs , and does generate momentum towards its climax , when a visit by a tax auditor ( daniel prevost ) creates even more chaos . veber does predictably try to find a moral to the story , allowing brochant to learn a lesson about using cruelty as a spectator sport . it's a token effort , since neither veber nor lhermitte seem much interested in developing brochant as a character until the final five minutes . there are also a couple of jokes that just don't work in translation -- puns that feel too forced , and a put-on belgian accent that's only as riotous as your familiarity with belgian accents . still , the dinner game amuses and entertains persistently , if not consistently , mining its basic dolt-with-fuming-straight-man premise for all it's worth . that final point should be emphasized , since the internet movie database notes that veber is preparing his own english-language version of the dinner game . he should know by now that one moderately appealing comedy is generally all his farces are worth . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
invites the tag line for american beauty , and rarely has a two-word advertising campaign so effectively captured virtually everything a film has to say . it's easy to understand much of the praise , since it captures you in its world virtually from the first frame . it's also a surprisingly simple film in which the notions that should be its subtext dominate its text . simultaneously gripping and frustrating , american beauty is the best film of the year that irritated the hell out of me . this , first and most important : kevin spacey is brilliant . that's not exactly news , since spacey has been brilliant on a regular basis for several years , but in american beauty he burns himself into an incredibly difficult role . there is a hyper-real feeling to much of the film -- a sense of people perceiving the world and people around them at an exaggerated , almost grotesque level -- yet spacey finds the ideal balance between lester the comic sadsack and lester the rejuvenated man . he grips alan ball's best lines of dialogue and spits them out like bullets , dominating the film so completely you may not realize how little screen time he actually has . the twisted , surreal vision of america provided by ball and director sam mendes -- even with its now-preditable assault on soul-deadening middle class life -- could have made for a masterpiece with a revelatory sensitbility at its core . instead , it's a very good film that makes a very rare mistake . where most films exist entirely at the surface level , american beauty exists entirely _below_ the surface , which is both tragic and ironic . it's easy to say that american beauty is about finding joy in the improbable places already around you instead of seeking unattainable ideals of joy , because the film makes this message excruciatingly clear in ricky's comments about his obsession with videotaping , as well as lester's narrative voice-overs . the ostensibly surprising moments in american beauty begin losing their power to surprise , since the film keeps telling you that things are not what they seem on the surface . it never allows a moment to let the surfaces just be surfaces , opting instead to spell out that real beauty is a wind-blown plastic bag . amazingly , american beauty still manages to be occasionally spell-binding , even as it stumbles through its literalism . mendes shows an impressive command of film language for a rookie with stage roots , using the talents of cinematographer conrad hall and composer thomas newman to create strong , always consistent vision . american beauty dazzles , it entertains , it shows off an actor at the top of his form . it just isn't nearly as enlightening as it seems to be , because it never asks the viewer to do too much work . as good as the film is , it isn't necessary for us to look closer . the film-makers have done all the looking for us . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : quentin tarrantino . what do you say about a movie when you thought it was filled with great scenes , but that they didn't add up to a great movie ? as one might expect from that pairing , this is no tea party ; it's a violent , high energy thrill ride filled with quirk characters usually engaged in shooting , getting shot at , beating the hell out of someone , or getting the hell beat out of them . the pacing is frantic , and the character interplay generally engaging . perhaps the problem is that when it's all over , i'm not quite sure whether there was a point beyond a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing . the first half-hour of true romance , focusing on clarence and alabama's whirlwind courtship , is perhaps its most coherent . the story is focused on two characters , and we have a chance to get to know something about them . as clarence , slater is cool and charismatic ; arquette is appealing in a sketchy role ( tarrantino seems to need some work writing women ) . from there , the story launches into a collection of vignettes , many of which pack a solid punch . bronson pinchot has some standout moments as a hollywood sycophant with a particularly weak stomach . scene after scene was either hilarious or gripping or both , but i felt distracted by the sheer number of supporting characters who appeared then disappeared all in a matter of minutes . it's an odd sort of compliment which becomes complaint : i didn't get enough of almost every character . the cast list is filled with " names , " but michael rapaport as clarence's struggling actor buddy has more screen time than most of them . much as it did for me in the player , though to a lesser degree , the star counting just got in the way . the story is fairly simple ; what makes the film stand out is tarrantino's marvelous ear for dialogue . there's not a cliche'd line to be found , and it makes the characters vibrant and alive . unfortunately , tony scott doesn't do the script the justice it deserves . i readily admit that i consider scott a hack as a director . with the intensity of tarrantino's material , a subtler touch is required . i give scott credit for a nifty roller-coaster sequence , but apart from that the monotony of the direction wore on me . i expected to hear " take my breath away " at any moment . when it comes right down to it , i was entertained by true romance . tarrantino knows how to deliver action and sharply drawn characters which keep the viewer engaged . i should also make special mention of hans zimmer's infectious calypso-tinged percussion score , which lent a heightened sense of the surreal . for me , however , this was a textbook case of the whole not equaling the sum of the parts . there was no real emotional linchpin , like mr . orange in reservoir dogs , to engage me beyond the purely visceral , and i can only care about a movie so far if i didn't care about any of the characters . like the roller-coaster in the film , true romance offers on philosophical truths , just a neck-snapping , gut churning white knuckler of a time . if that's what you're looking for , that's what you'll find . 
miramax is marketing into the west as a " family film , " and while it's admirable to do so , i'm not sure it's the best idea . on the one hand , the deliberate pace appeared to lose the children in the audience when i saw the film . on the other , adults without children tend to stay away from " family films , " and that would be a shame . into the west is a charming , wise and gentle film that shows enough confidence to build slowly to a satisfying climax . i spent the first half hour or so of into the west a bit edgy and uninvolved , but it slowly began to occur to me that there might be an intentional reason . the scenes set in dublin are dark and claustrophobic , but as the action spreads into the irish countryside the film takes on a lyrical majesty . while into the west is not quite as successful overall , there is still a quiet grace to the visual narrative , thanks to cinematographer tom sigel's beautiful photography of hills and coastlines . the performances are not quite as engaging as the look of the film . gabriel byrne , as the dour and laconic papa , doesn't carry off his emotional scenes particularly well . ruaidhri conroy is sharp and good-natured as the protective older brother , if at times a bit affected . ciaran fitzgerald , however , is a scene-stealing charmer with great comic sensibility . the two are just right as brothers , and their scenes together are light and well-directed . if jim sheridan's script is a bit thin , it's because the story is secondary to the feel of the film . the villainous horse breeder and his police-officer henchman are perfunctory characters ; the story might have been done just as well without them . i also thought the portrayal of the travellers was underdeveloped , but i'll admit that's because i've studied celtic folklore and wanted to see more . still , i never really minded the lack of depth because the mystical tone seemed right on . i noted earlier that into the west was less successful as afilm for children , and that assessment comes simply from listening . if you've ever seen a movie with an audience comprised largely of children , you know that you get a minute-by-minute account of what they think about it . an older boy said simply , " nothing's happening . " while hardly a scientific test , these and other comment seemed to suggest that young ones without long attention spans might be less than enthralled . it's not a rollicking adventure , or a home alone-style comedy . however , for anyone with a taste for rich atmosphere spiced with a touch of magic might be pleasantly surprised . 
steven soderbergh's the limey is sort of an action crime-drama -- only there's not all that much action , and relatively little crime . it's sort of a character study -- only there's not a whole lot of the main character to study . it's sort of an avant garde experiment by soderbergh -- only soderbergh has been plenty more avant garde in the past . the limey keeps nudging you for artistic respect , and you keep thinking you might give it more if only it would stop nudging . intriguing films don't often feel as minimally satisfying as the limey . on the surface , it seems like it has plenty going for it ( though surface is one of the main things it does have going for it ) . i suspect the limey would have felt like a 25-year-too-late episode of " mannix " if soderbergh hadn't jolted the film's visual style . in effect , he turns most of the film into an extension on his clooney/lopez seduction sequence in out of sight -- flashing forward , flashing back , laying dialogue from one scene over images from another . it might have come off as simple gimmickry , if it weren't such an effective method of getting inside wilson's head . an ex-con in unfamiliar territory and coping with unresolved grief , he's living the jagged , stream-of-consciousness life soderbergh shows us on the screen . that's a wonderful start for an exploration of how a criminal comes to terms with the choices he has made and the effect of those choices on those in his life . and that's about as far as it goes . for all its moodiness and somber tones , the limey really isn't terribly interested in the complexities of its characters . terence stamp does a nice job as wilson , mixing a bit of introspection into the standard issue tough guy , but the introspection isn't as deep as all the mournful close-ups of stamp would suggest -- he's just , as they say in the self-help biz , looking for closure . guzman and warren are flat-out wasted as supporting players who barely have a chance to register , while fonda gets one or two decent moments as the fading tycoon . and you have to credit katt , because screenwriter lem dobbs doesn't seem otherwise keen on vivid personalities . it's not that the limey isn't an enjoyable piece of work . soderbergh is one of those directors who can give a mundane scene an electrifying twist , as in the unconventional way he films wilson's rampage at a downtown warehouse . the reason the limey never feels like a gritty vengeance caper , despite its car chases and shootouts , is that soderbergh is always yanking things 90 degrees from the expected direction . it would have made for an even better film , however , if it never felt like a gritty vengeance caper because it actually _wasn't_ a gritty vengeance caper . give soderbergh credity for the convincing illusion that this genre film is something else . stylistic flourishes aside , the limey is just a pretty darned good straight-ahead action crime-drama -- provided you like them with relatively little action , and not all that much crime . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
i have this sneaking suspicion that the extent to which viewers can appreciate dazed and confused may be limited by how readily they recognize it as a perfect capsule of mid-70s youth culture . it's a clever and completely un-self-conscious portrait of pot-smoking , beer-drinking teenagers revelling in the awareness that right now , nothing else really matters . as frequently as people tend to toss out comparisons between films , i think i can safely say that what american graffiti was to 1962 , dazed and confused is to 1976 . writer/director richard linklater's first feature was slacker , a quirky but gimmicky look at apathetic twenty-somethings that established his talent for creating unique and amusing characters . while many of the characters are recognizable high school types , what i found original was that these were types i actually recognized from high school , not from * movies * about high school . cool but basically decent randy interacts convincingly with both his jock buddies and the inexperienced mitch . linklater gives them sparkling dialogue , daring to let his characters talk like teenagers actually talk . the one major character failing in dazed is the absence of any equally interesting female characters ; many could be interchangeable . this is a male coming-of-age film first and foremost , but it could have been more inclusive . as a film without a real plot , dazed depends on set pieces and atmosphere . the hazing of the junior high girls is lively , as is a wacky monologue by the stoned slater about george and martha washington's fondness for marijuana . however , there's a fair amount of dead space , and it's left to the cast of unknowns to fill it . they are generally personable enough to do so , particularly wiggins and cochrane , but not always . as for atmosphere , it's dead on . dazed captures 1976 brilliantly , from the bell bottoms and feathered hair to the soundtrack of early hard rock classics to a pair of statues painted to look like members of kiss . the production design had to be perfect , and it is . anyone who can't quite recall a time when sex was safe and far fewer kids " just said no " should take a look just for the sake of historical accuracy . it's impossible for me to determine whether those not in my age bracket will be as enamored of dazed and confused as i was . it's a slight , loopy little film with no pretensions , and it was a page right out of my own youth . i don't know . . . maybe you had to be there . of course , * i * didn't inhale . 
director : michael mann . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 155 minutes . in another place and time , he would have crafted operas -- grand-scale tales of human conflict blown up several times larger than life , accompanied by choruses and crescendos . neither the subject matter nor the genre alters mann's sense of the theatrical . the gothic horror of the keep , the cop/crook conflict of heat , the historical drama of the last of the mohicans -- all were treated as very important films , sometimes through sprawling running times , sometimes through lingering slow-motion images . mann's brand of operatic cinema has never quite been my cup of tea , and i was even more skeptical when i knew he had gotten his hands on material like the insider . this was , after all , a story about undeniably important issues : the insidious influence of corporate consolidation ; journalistic ethics ; the weighty responsibility of challenging the powers that be . could mann resist creating a film that would collapse under the weight of its self-imposed significance ? he could , and he did , though the insider is a much better personal story than it is a sweeping indictment of journalism-as-big-business . ironically , that pig-headed side of wigand is shown to be the reason he persists even when brown & williamson starts playing the hardest hardball . it's also the side that makes the insider most compelling -- and most unnerving -- as b&w begins digging up every possible speck of dirt from wigand's past to discredit him . it's a notion only a half-step removed from the tragic state of our political process -- the discouraging idea no sane man would open his entire history , warts and all , to public scrutiny . as long as the insider sticks close to wigand's story and the ever-mounting repercussions for his actions , it's pretty strong stuff . paper chase storytelling is tough to pull off , and mann does a more than serviceable job of finding drama in ethical debate . it's just that once again he's in opera man mode , giving pacino a stage for railing with righteous indignation ( a scenario that never does pacino any favors ) . the subject is interesting , but it is not about the deathknell of the free press . at more than two and a half hours , the insider starts to drag , and feels particularly out-of-control when mann drags in the unabomber story near the conclusion . mann does know how to make a moment of truth crackle ; he knows how to create compelling human stories . he doesn't always know when enough is enough -- when that next shot of someone walking in super slow-mo will feel overly pretentious , or when that wailing chorus will begin to grate on the nerves . eventually , even after plenty of solid filmmaking , you're just ready for that fat lady to hurry up and sing already . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
director : robert deniro . after working with some of the finest directors of his time , deniro proves he's learned what goes into directing a good film with his first helming effort , a bronx tale . while his style frequently bears more than a passing resemblance to frequent collaborator martin scorsese , he's adept enough to get away with it , and adds enough of his own vision to make him credible . hang all of this on a strong story about a young man learning about life from two mentors and you have a solid , entertaining two hours at the movies . a bronx tale has been adapted from a one-man play by palminteri , and it has made an exceptional transition to the screen . it doesn't feel stagy like last year's adaptation of a few good men , and has an easy flow , even between the 1960 and 1968 segments . palminteri's script is full of colorful characters and evocative period atmosphere , and the first half in particular is also quite funny . however , i was far less engaged when the tone took a turn towards the overly serious and focused on racial tensions . the romance between calogero and jane felt forced , and ultimately i didn't think the climactic racial confrontation worked . the film had established such a unique and interesting central triangle of calogero , sonny and lorenzo that i was disappointed when that conflict took a back seat . the appeal of that conflict is part character , part performance . the two father figures are complicated characters portrayed by two fine actors . palminteri handles sonny just as deftly . calogero's moral uncertainty is real because the good guy and bad guy in a bronx tale frequently exchange hats . francis capra is very good as the mischievous young calogero , but i was less impressed by lillo brancato . he's a bit too blank , and adopts too many deniro mannerisms ( brancato won the part by doing an impression of deniro ) . jane is written basically as a " type , " and taral hicks looks painfully uncomfortable a great deal of the time . the combination of these two weaker performances only added to my antipathy toward the romantic subplot . robert deniro's direction , as i've noted , owes much to martin scorsese ; indeed , an early scene introducing the nicknamed regulars at sonny's bar is lifted straight out of goodfellas . deniro also displays scorsese's gift for pacing and crisp images . but this is more than a knock-off job . deniro's tone is lighter , more affirming and optimistic . in that respect , a bronx tale perhaps bears more resemblance to the current king of the hill than it does to goodfellas . it's a flawed film , but does considerably more right than it does wrong . a bronx tale is a coming-of-age fable in which robert deniro shows he has come of age as a filmmaker . 
director : tim burton . mpaa rating : r ( violence , gore , adult themes , sexual situations ) running time : 102 minutes . watching sleepy hollow , you realize that tim burton could have made a definitive masterwork about the headless horseman . . . if anyone had given him a script that was actually about the headless horseman . changing source material -- even radically changing source material -- is nothing new in hollywood , so it's not terribly surprising to find only a passing resemblance between the film and washington irving's classic ghost story . there is plenty of splendid , grisly entertainment in burton's brand of quirky gothic horror , but it's bogged down in a story that's a cross between a parlor mystery and an episode of " scooby doo . " from its very first moments , sleepy hollow shows tremendous promise . here he's an eccentric revelation as the big city rationalist coping with supernatural phenomena . depp has a ridiculous amount of fun with crane's prissiness , and burton gets lots of mileage out of spraying him with blood . burton gets even more mileage out of the spectacular look of sleepy hollow , from the twisted woods to the gloomy town . he nails the spooky side of the story , combining effective action with flying body parts a-plenty whenever the headless horseman is at the center of the narrative . unfortunately , he's not at the center of the narrative nearly often enough . eventually , the film becomes focused on crane's efforts to understand the connection between the victims and who might be controlling the horseman . i wonder who might possibly care . the question of the head behind the headless horseman not only becomes an irritating distraction -- and means you can count on a tedious expository scene of the villain explaining his/her plan in excruciating detail -- it robs the horseman of too much power . andrew kevin walker's script ( tweaked by tom stoppard ) turns a primally frightening apparition into little more than hired muscle from beyond the grave . i suppose that one glaring misstep is so troubling because sleepy hollow has so much going for it as one of burton's typically grim fairy tales . between the delights of depp's performance and the dark enchantment of the production design , it's easy to start feeling the potential for brilliance . you only need to feel the energy level rise when the horseman is on screen to understand that detective work didn't really belong in this story . sleepy hollow may be somebody's idea of " fleshing out " washington irving's story , but what it really needed was less flesh and more ectoplasm . burton has made a wonderful monster movie from a script that doesn't understand this is a monster movie . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
sometimes there is no better demonstration of a concept poorly executed than the same concept well executed . take tumbleweeds , for instance . sound familiar ? it should -- the plot is virtually identical to that of the current susan sarandon/natalie portman film anywhere but here . tumbleweeds just happens to be a rich character study that feels genuinely human , instead of like a hollywood construct . it doesn't start out looking that way . the wacky set pieces smack of contrivance , turning tumbleweeds into a low-budget variation on mainstream tales of female bonding . even the hand-held camera work starts to seem more like a contrivance than a tool to evoke a sense of urgency the very grittiness o'connor is aiming for becomes just another brand of glossiness . newcomer kimberly j . brown's performance as ava , which had seemed too rough around the edges , develops into something intriguing and unique , not at all the typical mature-beyond-her-years , foul-mouthed-beyond-prime-time movie kid . janet mcteer's brassy mary jo similarly blossoms into a character easy to understand but considerably harder to pin down . the relationship between the two shows all the twists , turns and knots of a complex mother/daughter pairing , but there's never a sense of manufactured conflict . these people behave like real people ; their battles don't sound scripted , and their interdependent affection is thoroughly convincing . brown and mcteer are both pretty darned good , but the reason tumbleweeds starts to work so well is that o'connor doesn't force the story to rest entirely on their shoulders . tumbleweeds gives its two central characters a context in which to operate , something sadly lacking in anywhere but here . verisimilitude isn't necessary for every kind of film , but it's fairly useful in a character study . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : atom egoyan , based on the novel by william trevor . director : atom egoyan . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity , sexual situations ) running time : 116 minutes . without revealing too much , it's fair to say that joseph hilditch ( bob hoskins ) is not what he appears to be . then again , it may not . felicia's journey , adapted by atom egoyan from william trevor's novel , is an investigation into relationship pathology that works beautifully while those pathologies remain enigmatic . for the first half of the film , egoyan darts and weaves through time and place , showing us both of the principal characters searching for someone to cling to . her search is clearly doomed from the start , but no less doomed than the quest of mr . hilditch . there's plenty of rich psychological material in the intersection of these two characters , and egoyan keeps it compelling for much of the running time . bob hoskins' performance anchors the material , creating a character that keeps the audience off balance . when hoskins wants you to feel for hilditch , you'll feel for him . hilditch develops in so many unexpected ways that the film's resolution can only come as a disappointment . egoyan is incapable of letting felicia's journey become a simple genre film , but he's stuck with genre conventions all the same ( though why he assented to mychael danna's clanking , ham-fisted instrumental score , i have no idea ) . as a dramatic climax , however , it's unsatisfying , a deus-by-proxy ex machina way for hilditch's eyes to be opened . and egoyan should henceforth resist the temptation to close his films with explicatory voice-overs ( see also : the sweet hereafter ) . those flaws might have crushed another film , but felicia's journey gets off to too solid a start . hoskins' performance alone makes felicia's journey worthy watching ; it's just a shame that such a subtle performance ends with such melodrama . " things take a turn , " hilditch ominously intones at one point , which could easily summarize felicia's journey . it's a turn that wrings simple quality from potential brilliance . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
director : henry selick . if jurassic park proved one thing , it was this : image * is * everything . what the public seems to want most from movies is spectacle ; show them something they've never seen before , and they'll beat a path to the theater door , even if the story is fairly simplistic . this news should come as a great comfort to touchstone pictures and tim burton . the nightmare before christmas is a straightforward , somewhat bland fable which would have put me to sleep if done with live action or traditional hand-drawn animation . however , its stop-motion figures and incredible production design are dazzling enough to give nightmare a delightfully timeless quality which make it far more entertaining than it could have been . first , the good news : nightmare is truly unlike anything you've ever seen before . the look combines old rankin/bass christmas specials , edward gorey illustrations and the beatles' yellow submarine to create a remarkably distinctive and detailed world . the animation is incredibly fluid , to the extent that i began to wonder whether a couple of characters were real humans somehow edited into the film . it was the kind of film where i never took my eyes off the screen because i was afraid of missing something . director henry selick avoids the pitfall of " showing off " his toys ; he keeps the camera moving , telling the story visually with style and effectiveness , particularly jack's graveyard song after his christmas coup . the down side of this complex and expensive animation technique is that the story had to be packed into under 75 minutes . there is no time for nuance of character or well-developed motivations ; the filmmakers slam through the plot at a breakneck pace , avoiding lags in pace but also avoiding a truly engaging story . the villainous character of oogie boogie also comes up a bit short , and a slightly grumpy santa could have been very interesting . the story is a fairy tale , so i don't take issue with the simplicity of the plot . i was just disappointed with the apparent decision to throw everything into the visuals . perhaps most disappointing is the song score by frequent tim burton collaborator danny elfman . taking an operatic approach , nightmare is almost entirely through-sung , making the songs a crucial element of the film . but with the exception of the lively " what's this ? " during jack's discovery of christmas town , the tunes are fairly tedious and the lyrics lacking in wit . they seemed designed simply to move the story forward , not to inspire humability like the best ashman/menken tunes from the recent disney films . it's surprising given elfman's playful oingo boingo oeuvre that his songs here are so somber and uninspired . some movies are called feasts for the senses . the nightmare before christmas qualifies as a feast for the sense , singular . while there is very little worth listening to in the film , there is more than enough worth looking at to compensate , particularly for those with a slightly twisted sense of humor . 
for more than forty years -- certainly since the 1956 film version of the king and i -- yul brynner has been the king of siam , and the king of siam has been yul brynner . actors often define roles , and roles often define actors ( the latter much to the actors' chagrin ) , but rarely as a role/actor identification been so strong , and so reciprocal . a yul brynner impression without the words " puzzlement " or " et cetera " just isn't a yul brynner impression ; a king of siam without a bald dome just isn't the king of siam . it is the authoritative grace with which chow pulls off that feat that makes anna and the king such an unexpected pleasure . since the story is ultimately an epic romance , nothing is more important to anna and the king's success than the connection between its principal characters . when necessary , he is convincingly aloof and regal , looking and behaving every bit the stern ruler . he also shows a wonderfully light touch , lending a devilish smile to his jabs at anna's strong will . even the more overtly emotional scenes -- clearly meant to pound home the heaviness of the head that wears the crown -- are nicely under-played . those familiar with chow primarily as an action star should take note : his versatility keeps the romantic angle in anna and the king fresh and convincing . he's not quite so lucky with the political angle . the double-dealings are pretty conventional stuff , leading to an exploding bridge climax that feels like it belongs in an entirely different film ( one directed by jan de bont , perhaps ) . in fact , anna and the king stumbles whenever director andy tennant draws too much attention either to finger-wagging at cultural imperialism ( a blowsy british merchant insulting mongkut at a dinner party ) or to his own direction ( an operatically staged beheading ) . even in a film that runs two and a half hours , there's just not enough time to spend away from its complicated central relationship . fortunately , anna and the king is ultimately redeemed by its splendor . no , not the splendor of luciana arrighi's production design or caleb deschanel's cinematography , though both pieces of work are exceptional . it's the splendor of chow yun-fat that carries anna and the king through its occasional stretches of anachronistic anti-colonial posturing and trite palace intrigue . creating the image of a king is a difficult enough task ; re-creating a king who is already an icon would seem to be thankless . chow is nothing less than a presence that takes over anna and the king -- with his humor , his poise , his majesty . . . et cetera , et cetera , et cetera . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
topsy-turvy is not a bio-pic in the conventional sense of the term . it's a bio-pic in the mike leigh sense of the term , which may be redundant . however , it may not even be appropriate to call it a mike leigh film in the conventional sense of the term . one does not think of period pieces when one thinks of mike leigh , nor would one likely think of him as the ideal film-maker to look behind the scenes at the creation of gilbert & sullivan's " the mikado . " how would this fashioner of human drama approach the fashioning of light opera ? as it turns out , he does so with detail , detail and more detail -- occasionally to nerve-wracking excess . but the concept for " the mikado " is only the beginning of the arduous process of staging it . when topsy-turvy finally hits its stride , with gilbert's visit to the exposition , it's an extraordinarily entertaining piece of work . leigh dives into the pre-production process with gusto , exploring every possible element of a theater company's work . the rehearsal scene , in which gilbert attends to the details of pacing and the inconvenient absence of two actors , is hilarious even in its attention to the mundane ; a scene of gilbert using japanese women as advisors for cultural authenticity has a similarly unexpected charm . you know a film-maker is doing something write when he can wring comedy out of a wardrobe session , and drama out of whether or not a song will be cut from the production . it would be easy to embrace topsy-turvy unreservedly if leigh seemed to know what to cut from his own production . even at 160 minutes , the film never seems tedious ; it does , however , seem unnecessarily meandering . leigh also goes overboard in the inclusion of musical numbers , giving us full-scale recreations of at least a half-dozen songs from three different productions . while the inclusion of some gilbert and sullivan work would seem necessary as context , leigh takes too much liberty with the length and breadth of his musical interludes . by the end of topsy-turvy , you may feel you've sat through " princess aida " and " the mikado " in their entirety . in most films , the extra weight would probably have sunk the whole endeavor . blessedly , topsy-turvy is that rare film that gets better with every passing minute , building to that enchanting final hour of preparation for production . still more blessedly , leigh has put together another superb cast to give the scenes as much bite as possible , including leigh veterans like alison steadman ( life is sweet ) and timothy spall ( secrets & lies ) . broadbent's gilbert has a bit more to work with -- and hence the showier part -- but corduner's more amiable , artistic integrity-bound sullivan is a delight as well . leigh covers a lot of ground in topsy-turvy -- perhaps , ultimately , too much -- but he has the good sense to come back around to the good stuff . the result is a biography as singular as leigh himself : messy , insightful and , of course , very human . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
brian depalma needs a hit * really * badly . it doesn't hurt any that he has latched on to a solid story and brought out dynamite performances from pacino and sean penn . carlito's way , while hampered by depalma's characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism , is a truly tense and engrossing drama . carlito's way will probably make the strongest impression with the two outstanding set pieces which bracket the film . yet for all the viscera , i found the character study even more compelling . but where the culmination of the godfather saga played like opera , there's more of an immediacy to carlito's way , an ever-present sense of doom launched by the title sequence which sets the flashback story in motion . you sense that there's no way , after so many years , that carlito can stay out of trouble . pacino captures carlito's dilemma with surprising subtlety and the cautious observation borne of years of experience watching every corner for an enemy . sean penn is even better , turning in his best performance to date as kleinfeld . he could have been simply pathetic , a heavy drinker and cocaine addict playing tough with guys way out of his league , but penn invests kleinfeld with tremendous nervous energy and an overwhelming survival instinct . as compelling as the narrative is , viewers may experience a profound sense of deja vu . depalma continues to steal shamelessly from other directors , this time adding scorsese to his repertoire with a point of view tracking shot and a copacabana scene with more than passing resemblances to goodfellas . he even recycles some of his own previous plagiarisms , like a 360 degree swing around a kiss ( vertigo via body double ) and the climactic shootout which will strike many as far too reminiscent of the train station sequence from the untouchables . from a story standpoint , there's an obligatory love story with a cliche'd long-suffering girlfriend character . penelope ann miller is a good but limited actor who doesn't do anything new with the role , and eventually she becomes just a distraction , never integrated fully enough into the story . still , it's easier to be forgiving of superficial flaws when the backbone is so solid . the two principle characters held an iron grip on my attention , one all the cinematic thievery in the world couldn't break . carlito's way plays like a tragic novel : deliberate , confident and powerful . those willing to grant depalma his tendencies towards the extreme should find themselves well- rewarded . 
truth be told , i should disqualify myself from reviewing ruby in paradise . you see , i have a certain bias : i've fallen helplessly , hopelessly , desperately in love with ashley judd . as ruby lee gissing , the central character in writer/director victor nunez's low-key character study , judd delivers a phenomenally appealing performance , capturing a young woman's struggle to make her life better with frankness and intelligence . it moves very slowly , and virtually nothing substantive happens from a plotting standpoint . but that internal story is one rarely examined , the story of a young woman on a journey of self-discovery , and victor nunez handles it with gentle insight . she is filled with complex and conflicting emotions and attitudes--a basic morality colliding with her rejection of her religious upbringing , a hope that life can be better coupled with a certain cynicism . so much is conveyed in ruby's description of her first night with mike : " and yes , we got it on , all tender and romantic . " ruby lee gissing is one of the best written female characters to grace the screen this year . oh yes , and there's this ashley judd person . her portrayal of ruby is nothing short of stunning , a heartbreaking yet ultimately affirming take on one woman's strength of spirit . her pride in her own resourcefulness is captured in a comment to rochelle : " i managed to get out without getting pregnant or beat up ; that's something . " if ruby in paradise fails to be fully satisfying , it's because nunez doesn't surround ruby with characters one-tenth as interesting as she is . ricky is so slimy and transparent that he inspired hoots from most of the audience , and bentley mitchum is not subtle enough an actor to underplay the easiest mannerisms to overplay . todd field handles mike a bit better , but mike also is too much of a " type " instead of a person . " mama's family " and " all my children " veteran dorothy lyman could have been much more interesting as ruby's surrogate mother , but she's too cold in her early scenes and maintains a certain aloofness throughout . it's too bad nunez couldn't have invested as much in the featured players . ruby in paradise does drift somewhat , and its two hour running time is a bit much . still , it's amazing what one great character and one great performance can do for a slow-moving story , and ashley judd's ruby is worth the price of admission all by herself . ashley , if you're reading this , i'm in the book . 
director : norman jewison . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence ) running time : 146 minutes . there are times when i'm watching a film and i just know it has fallen victim the demon expectations . audiences expect certain things from certain kind of films -- they expect love stories to end with a kiss , they expect horror films to end with a jolt , they expect action films to end with a big chase and/or a big explosion . the ebb and flow of traditional narrative becomes part of the way people watch movies , and film-makers know this . the familiarity is comforting ; it makes it easy for people to keep up . scripts are structured not exactly to give the people what they want , but to give them what they know -- which , for all practical purposes , is the same thing . the hurricane is a drama that follows a legal proceding , and it gives the audience what they expect by ending with a verdict . it's also a disappointing resolution for a story that's actually about so much more than guilt or innocence . the biographical background material , which had felt somewhat labored , starts to flesh out a portrait of carter's background of distrust of any force outside himself . denzel washington , after a number of roles in which his commanding presence was lost on mediocre material , turns carter into a character with a fascinating arc . unfortunately , the script begins taking the story into predictable , uninspired directions . the investigation consistently suffers from a sense of manufactured drama , as well as from the complete absence of character development for the three canadians ( they've been compressed from nine real-life individuals , so we can be thankful for small favors ) . it's obvious we're heading for a showdown before the bench , and a series of impassioned speeches about justice . and frankly , i didn't really care , because i knew every minute spent on the details of the case was a minute not spent exploring carter as a character . there is far too much to like about washington's performance -- and , to give credit where it's due , about newcomer shannon's performance as well -- for the hurricane not to be ultimately satisfying . the hurricane simply loses focus on its strengths at times , wandering into familiar territory for its emotional catharsis . in a sense , armyan bernstein and dan gordon deserve kudos for finding a compelling perspective in fusing their two source materials . it's hard not to wish that the film hadn't been more willing to let the audience find that perspective as well . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
starring : robin williams , sally field , pierce brosnan , harvey fierstein . screenplay : randi mayem singer & leslie dixon . director : chris columbus . i've never been a member of the robin williams fan club . a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way , and i sometimes feel as though i'm watching a 40-year-old class clown . in his films , williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy-feely emotion , leading to wildly uneven performances . doubtfire seemed ready-made for the same problems , but instead it proves to be williams' best comic screen project yet . while it still contains some characteristic self-indulgence , mrs . doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly-laugh comedy served up with high energy . mrs . doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work , and basically it does so . the most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel , and thanks to the fantastic special makeup that's instantly believable . it may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film , making dustin hoffman's dorothy michaels look like milton berle . more problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell ; it's a bit hard to swallow that she doesn't recognize any of the voices as her husband's . perhaps the biggest contrivance we're asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs . doubtfire in a few minutes . there's more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask . fortunately , these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll . during the film , i was generally too busy laughing . after getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams' riffing , mrs . daniel's frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful , as is the climactic restaurant sequence , even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away . clearly , most of the credit for doubtfire's success goes to robin williams . it took putting him in drag , but for once he plays a comic character that isn't just robin williams with a different name . he thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire , and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foul-mouthed . his responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty , but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity . it's one of mrs . doubtfire's charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect , just people trying to be better . as miranda , sally field is solid in a background role , and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu . the children are also good , although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest . the supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing . it's easy to see mrs . doubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over , and it's true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common . doubtfire manages to carve out its own space , particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judge's decision and the ultimate status of daniel and miranda's relationship . doubtfire , but there are plenty of laughs , and good comedies are always in short supply . and it's nice to see robin williams just act for a change . 
mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , nudity , adult themes ) running time : 105 minutes . it's entirely possible that a film version of the end of the affair -- graham greene's novel of passion , obsession and faith -- could be made without getting into the explicit details of its protagonists' extra-marital exploits . and in fact it already has , in a weepy 1955 version starring deborah kerr and van johnson . some would no doubt argue that the more restrained approach has its merits , but there's something about this source material that demands an approach that couldn't be filmed in 1955 . i can't remember the last time a mainstream film featured as much intense , forthright sexuality -- of the groping , grinding , gasping variety -- as the end of the affair . and i can't remember the last time it would have been quite so thematically appropriate . neil jordan's approach to much of the end of the affair is in fact fairly restrained . michael nyman's string score pulses throughout the film , adding a layer of heightened drama , but the performances play against the music effectively . ralph fiennes' work may be too reminiscent of his character in the english patient , but it's right for the role , as is stephen rea's hangdog henry . though the repetition of those scenes gives the film a slightly lurching pace , it also shows how easy it is to misinterpret key moments in our lives . his even bigger risk pays off even more definitively . let viewers go in forewarned : the end of the affair is a steamy affair , the sex scenes a deft tightrope act between pure animal passion and intense emotion . the end of the affair circa 1999 combines the appeal of old-fashioned tragic romance with greene's ahead-of-his-time psychology of irrational desire ( whether temporal or spiritual ) . it may make you uncomfortable , but you can't deny its honesty . jordan does an impressive job of making the novel's philosophical musings solid cinema , retaining all the thematic weight without too much ponderous voice-over . there's also the ongoing pleasure of ian hart's sharp , understated work as the private detective who takes tremendous pride in his professionalism . and even when they no longer fill the screen , the end of the affair's scenes of illicit eroticism linger like a memory of addictive high . jordan does justice to greene's 1950s narrative by doing what the 1950s couldn't do -- showing the middle of an affair that made the end of the affair a tragedy . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " .

" wayne's world " was already a minor miracle by the standards of " saturday night live " sketches before it ever made it to the big screen . where most snl premises exhaust all charm in roughly a minute , wayne and garth provided consistent laughs . then they tempted fate by turning a five-minute sketch into a full length film , and it became a huge , goofy hit . so the question became , would the inevitable sequel finally show a concept running on fumes ? wayne's world 2 is a collection of more good-natured pokes at popular culture , propelled by the infectious exuberance of mike myers as our hero . of course , plot ultimately means very little . wayne's world , in both its television and film incarnations , is about a generation whose collective consciousness is a swirl of pop culture icons . the gags play on both genre conventions and particular images , but somehow they manage to be sharper and more " in " than the slew of genre parodies which littered theaters this year . the best known targets in wayne's world 2 ( kung fu films , the graduate , the doors ) get the most extensive treatments , but myers isn't afraid to pull out obscure references to mahogany rush or 70's detergent and shampoo commercials . wayne and garth , for all the inevitable comparisons , are no beavis and butthead ; they're clever and sharp- witted , simply with all their literacy derived from the media . they're in on the joke with their audience , and they're willing to assume that audience can keep up with them . social commentary aside , wayne's world 2 is just plain laugh- out-loud funny . even the most obvious gags , like the performance of village people's " y . m . c . a . " which is destined to become this film's " bohemian rhapsody , " are handled with real zest . through it all struts mike myers , sporting wayne's trademark wiseguy grin . the sense of fun he pumps into wayne is almost always engaging , and most importantly he never seems to be trying to put anything over on his audience . as a performer , his enthusiasm can make up for numerous rough edges . and there are rough edges in wayne's world 2 . christopher walken's character is basically a retread of rob lowe's from the first film , but without the campy appeal . the dana carvey/ kim basinger segments never really worked for me , primarily because i generally find carvey annoying . overall , the direction isn't as creative as penelope spheeris' work in the first , but spheeris turned out the beverly hillbillies , so maybe that makes it even . like many recent sequels , wayne's world 2 includes copycat elements from its predecessor , but far fewer than most , and there's plenty of fresh fun to be found . 
perhaps most significantly , american beauty became a critical and popular success with its cynical take on the facade of suburban bliss . it doesn't take long for a film's entire context to change . could judy berlin avoid feeling instantly , jarringly out-of-step ? in the case of judy berlin , such concerns probably seem silly , since its style is already so surreal and timeless . if judy berlin looks and plays like a suburban spin on a woody allen ensemble comedy , it shouldn't be surprising ; mendelsohn spent years as an assistant costume designer for allen films . essentially it's a character study , exploring the submerged longings of its suburban denizens that come to the surface only when the eclipse causes time to stand still . the veteran cast members deliver some superb performances , particularly kahn in a very funny yet very sad piece of work , and barrie as the not-well-liked teacher with an unknown inner life . judy berlin manages to hit some effective comic notes while always staying true to the small , very personal desires of even its peripheral characters . mendelsohn's main characters , however , fare less well . the title of the film tells us to focus on the interaction between david and judy as the thematic center , and , unfortunately , the center doesn't hold . david exists primarily as a stand-in for the filmmaker -- the frequent , nudgy references to the fact that we're watching a story that's going to be turned into a film don't help matters -- and hornick doesn't do enough with what is there . it's a very entertaining performance as an endearing character , but judy is more a symbol of possible escape than a fully-realized person . while david's mopey self-loathing may ultimately come in for affectionate mockery , that doesn't make it any easier to latch on to him as a protagonist , or to care about the fate of david and judy's relationship . even when he fumbles one of his sub-plots , mendelsohn keeps judy berlin enough on the sweet side of bittersweet that it remains appealing . the look ( jeffrey seckendorf's black-and-white cinematography ) and sound ( michael nicholas's piano and harpsichord score ) may contribute much to judy berlin's sense of timelessness , but the story itself plays a significant role . the characters in the film spend much of the running in place because they're always looking behind them . how refreshing to find a film that suggests there's something to look forward to -- even in the suburbs . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
what planet are you from ? screenplay : michael leeson & garry shandling and peter tolan . producers : mike nichols , garry shandling and neil machlis . director : mike nichols . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , adult themes , nudity ) running time : 103 minutes . i started to get a sense for how good what planet are you from ? could be at around the fifth or sixth iteration of the gag . unfortunately , the men of this world have evolved without genitalia for lack of need , so harold is equipped with an artificial organ -- one that hums when he is aroused . as a gimmick , it's positively inspired , providing an auditory cue for every time harold starts feeling a bit randy . it's also a gimmick that could have grown really old really fast , turning what planet are you from ? into a one-joke movie without much to laugh at . i'm guessing that there are probably three dozen humming penis gags in what planet are you from ? and i'll be damned if i didn't laugh at every one of them . the reason the joke works for so long and with so many variations is that shandling ( who also co-wrote ) and company realize that you can still write a smart comic script that happens to include some lowbrow subjects ( he proved that point for several years on " the larry sanders show . " part high-concept comedy , part broad farce and part exploration of male-female dynamics , it's actually a clever spin on relationship tomes like " men are from mars , women are from venus " and " you just don't understand . " i suppose you could say what planet are you from ? is sort of an unruly film . actually , it's a _very_ unruly film , often leaping through sub-plots and minor characters too quickly to do them justice . goodman's troubles with his wife , which might have made a marvelous counterpoint to the alien's relationship troubles , instead serve as the source for a couple of throwaway gags . linda fiorentino is woefully underused as kinnear's femme fatale-ish wife , and there's a rushed feeling to all the scenes on harold's home world ( as though the budget wasn't quite there for a more thorough peek at their culture ) . for a film from mike nichols -- a director whose films almost always click with comic precision -- what planet is a bit ragged and scattershot . and it's also very , very funny . films with laugh-out-loud moments are embarassingly rare , which makes it all the more wonderful that what planet hits on so many levels of humor . the dialogue is full of the kind of razor-sharp punch lines that recall vintage woody allen . subtle bits of physical acting add kick to the simplest scenes ( watch for shandling's priceless change of expression during his first date with susan ) . predictable sight gags are given unpredictable twists . a weird shift to a hard-boiled exchange between shandling and goodman adds an effectivley bizarre late change of pace . even the warmer moments of gentle character humor work . but most of all , there's the gag -- not necessarily because it inspires the biggest laughs , but because it inspires the most . what planet are you from ? may be messy , but it sure is plenty entertaining . shandling and his cohorts prove that exquisite execution can take even the silliest concepts and make them . . . well , hum . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : pedro almodovar . director : pedro almodovar . pedro almodovar has always been a filmmaker with a world view that is -- to engage in a bit of understatement -- unique . he loves the blurry lines of sexuality ; he loves the complexities of romantic relationships . yet even when it comes to a subject like half the human race , almodovar won't do things the easy way . almodovar's critics have often accused him of being more fond of the conspicuously provocative than with genuine emotional content . and the plot thickens . . . or at least it gets dense with women on the verge of various breakdowns . in a sense , it's a lot like an art house spin on broad hollywood dramedies about the power of sistah-hood , with the male characters either utterly peripheral or half-female themselves . the reason all about my mother doesn't inspire world-class eye rolling ( like , for instance , hanging up ) is that almodovar really does want to make his characters complete . much of the comic relief is provided by the tart-tongued agrado , performed with depth beyond bitchy clichs by antonia san juan . almodovar's all-encompassing embrace of womankind could strike some viewers as inherently undramatic -- and in a sense , they'd be right . aside from the accident that claims manuela's son , there really isn't a pivotal plot moment in all about my mother . it's more of a general observation of the maternal instinct , with a magical medical cure thrown in for good measure . and it's hard to describe except to say that it works -- as character study , as off-beat comedy , as defense of unconventional matriarchy . you won't find many films that are simultaneously this warm and fuzzy and this weird . in the almodovar universe , you can hear those women roar in numbers too big -- and variations too strange and wonderful -- to ignore . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : kevin jarre . after a few decades when westerns were about as easy to find as jimmy hoffa , it seems like you can't sneeze at the movies these days without hitting a horse . tombstone is the name , ma'am , and surprisingly lively entertainment is the game . while no great piece of art , tombstone is a real old-fashioned shoot-em-up , energetically staged and acted and featuring a particularly memorable performance from val kilmer . but even that battle is not the end , as tombstone becomes the nexus of a blood feud which won't end until one side or the other is completely dead . it's action that tombstone is about first and foremost , and it delivers big time . there are few slow stretches , and they usually build towards something . the big shootout at the ok corral might be the least effective of the action pieces ; it's edited in a fairly confusing fashion which may accent the chaos of the situation but doesn't always make it clear who's shooting whom . otherwise the action is extremely well-choreographed , backed up by a bruce broughton score a bit too reminiscent of his work on silverado . fortunately , the action is where the comparisons to rambo end . tombstone is well-acted by its ensemble cast , in spite of the most distracting ( if authentic ) facial hair this side of gettysburg . kurt russell , never the most versatile of leading men , does bring an intense and reluctant heroism to wyatt . sam elliott and bill paxton are a bit more wooden in less-developed roles , but for the stoic and civic-minded earps it's not a distraction . sure , his lines are campy and anachronistic , but they are also quite funny . he drawls out his quips with a sly confidence , and turns in probably his best all-around performance yet . delaney is lovely , but her character is just a distraction ( as , unfortunately , are all of the female characters in tombstone ) , never adding anything in particular to the story or to wyatt's character . their scenes together seem simply to be a nod to the conventional wisdom that you need a love story to get women into the theater . while it's spending time wandering through the flowers , tombstone is nothing special , but when it sticks to its guns it generally finds its target . 
screenplay : jim sheridan & terry george . director : jim sheridan . any time you put together a ten best list right after the first of the year , you leave yourself open to potential embarrassment . in the name of the father was one of those potential trouble spots , but as it turns out i still consider my list complete . don't misunderstand me ; father is impeccably acted and efficiently directed . it simply never gripped me the way it should have . in the middle of an i . r . a . each of these stories would have made a taut and fascinating film , but combined both suffer . director and co-scripter jim sheridan makes some questionable choices in the early stages of their relationship , the most notable being a lack of insight into their interaction before their incarceration . the later scenes , as the two men come to a grudging understanding , are much better , but they would have been stronger still with a more carefully crafted backstory . the legal story of in the name of the father is clearly secondary , but it provides most of the film's best moments . as an examination of the potential for bloodlust in english jurisprudence , peter medak's let him have it is much more effective , a leaner and more focused story of a truly criminal proceeding . the performances in in the name of the father deliver its greatest strengths . his character is not as fully written as it could have been , but day-lewis fills in the cracks with his intensity and attention to detail . peter postlethwaite , as the physically frail but morally strong guiseppe , is a powerful presence , providing a tough counterpoint to the mercurial gerry . emma thompson , in an extremely small role , manages to be cool and determined but little more as peirce ; the script just doesn't ask much more of her . in the name of the father has garnered tremendous critical praise and a handful of golden globe nominations , and while i found it a good film i wonder if some of the accolades aren't a bit excessive . with the exception of daniel day-lewis' performance , in the name of the father is solid but not spectacular , an example of taking two great films and turning them into one good one . 
screenplay : susannah grant . director : steven soderbergh . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 133 minutes . steven soderbergh has fashioned one of those careers that movie people always claim they want . he gets to make unconventional , experimental films like kafka , schizopolis and the limey , while still making a few bucks doing " mainstream " films like king of the hill and out of sight . yet " mainstream " truly belongs in quotes where soderbergh is concerned , since his approach to timeworn genres is as unconventional and his conventionally unconventional work . despite his popularity with the art house set , he has found it difficult to cross over to a broader audience , since he keeps baffling that audience by taking amiable entertainments and putting meat on their bones . you might think you know what to expect from a coming-of-age story or a crime caper , but did you really expect what soderbergh delivered in king of the hill and out of sight ? erin brockovich is another film -- a legal crowd-pleaser with a tart-tongued heroine -- that looks like you should know what to expect . leave it to soderbergh to make even that kind of you-go-girl hollywood premise uniquely appealing . in most films of this kind , you would expect a combination of sassy one-liners and courtroom theatrics . you do get some of the former -- courtesy a solid susannah grant script that gives roberts plenty of no-nonsense dialogue to bite into -- but there's a way roberts plays a line that keeps the film from degenerating into mundanely rabble-rousing chick flickery . roberts has her detractors , particularly when it comes to her dramatic performances , yet erin brockovich finds her effectively taming the glamour girl looks into a convincing character . even when she's snapping off one of erin's saltier tirades against the lack of recognition she's getting , roberts never seems to be waiting for a laugh . she does one of the hardest things anyone can do with a character like this : she refuses to play erin with a wink to the audience so we all know it's julia roberts beneath the bitter exterior . you also have to give soderbergh his share of the credit for knowing how erin needed to be played , but it's no surprise to find him in control of his material . in keeping with the less-than-sexy title of the film , soderbergh makes sure the case never overwhelms the character . while the lawsuit against pacific gas & electric makes for compelling drama , it's not as compelling as erin navigating the path towards self-respect . the story features elements familiar from a hundred legal investigation dramas in the grisham era -- the nasty corporate monolith , gutsy underdogs , saintly victims , etc . -- but erin brockovich always seems to find an unexpected angle just when it's most necessary . erin brockovich does take its conventional turns , and -- not coincidentally -- that's usually when it starts to meander . erin's romance with a soft-hearted biker named george ( aaron eckhart ) leads to a trite " you care about your job more than your family " confrontation ( think sissy spacek's whine in jfk with a little gender role reversal ) , and there's one moment of precocious sensitivity by erin's son matthew ( scotty leavenworth ) that almost makes you want to shudder . still , soderbergh and roberts bring too much crackling originality to erin brockovich for its study of character through hard work to suffer too much . i'm not sure steven soderbergh's erin brockovich will set audiences to applauding as they leave the theater . that would happen in another director's version , one where the predictable doesn't have a way of turning into the unpredictable . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , nudity , drug use , adult themes ) running time : 114 minutes . it took five months for boys don't cry finally to make its way to utah . and after five months , plenty of opportunity for the film itself to fall dangerously short of everything i wanted it to be . boys don't cry is not a great piece of film craftsmanship . it's a performance showcase , and a very effective one . the surprise , however , is that the real showcase performance isn't the most talked-about one . at the center of the story , of course , is the mystery of brandon/teena -- who he was , how so many people were fooled , what brandon's transformation represented as both threat and promise to the other people involved in the story . swank's physical performance is superb , made even more effective by co-writer/director kimberly peirce's decision to introduce brandon already in male guise so the switch doesn't become a showy trick . but it's hard not to be more impressed with the physical performance than with what's going underneath it . there are moments when you see the awkwardness of a girl trying to be one of the guys , and moments in the harrowing final half hour when you see her peering in terror through the cracks in her reality . more often , brandon is an enigmatic catalyst . it seems as though peirce is more interested in what brandon stands for than in the person that was brandon teena . the upside to that perspective is that one of those people is lana , played with unnerving effectiveness by chloe sevigny . lana is in her way a more fascinating character than brandon -- she engages in just as much self-delusion , but her motivations are more complex . it's the sort of role most actresses would play initially with hard-edged bluster before unveiling the heart of gold beneath ; sevigny shows a slightly different perspective of lana every time she turns around . sevigny is part of a superb supporting cast , with sarsgaard and sexton similarly refusing to play their parts for easy interpretation . the entire milieu of the falls city youth has a heartbreaking genuineness to it -- particularly noteworthy is how lana's mother becomes " mom " to everyone in their desperation for any family relationship -- and peirce does a fine job of using brandon to explore the effect of a nonconformist on a place where reality is assumed to be static . it's the idea that peirce uses brandon at all that dampens the power of boys don't cry , however . the chilling resolution and wonderful supporting performances make it easy to recommend boys don't cry . i only wish that five months of focus on hilary swank hadn't led me to expect it would be the story of brandon teena . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
starring : robert duvall , richard harris , sandra bullock , piper laurie , shirley maclaine . screenplay : steve conrad . director : randa haines . hollywood films focusing on the elderly have generally fallen into two broad categories : comedies making them lovable codgers whose most mundane physical activity is turned into slapstick , and melodramas about loneliness and facing death . we've already had one from column a this winter--grumpy old men--which makes it somewhat surprising to see wrestling ernest hemingway so soon , even though it falls under column b ; studios are notoriously fastidious in avoiding conflict with target demographics . wrestling ernest hemingway is melodramatic , and its pacing is rather slow , but it is also filled with fine acting and quirky but believable relationships , and ultimately proves quite satisfying . the only time that hemingway really missteps is in its forced plot . director randa haines ( children of a lesser god ) plays up scenes like a shared skinny-dip and a certain male bonding ritual on the 4th of july , which come off as more than a little silly , and the score by michael convertino is enough to make one's teeth ache . it is to his credit that when he lets his characters talk to each other , things get much more interesting . yet this central relationship is only one of several which truly shine . she demonstrates a genuine affection for him , one which never comes off as patronizing ; their connection is sweet and very affirming . from top to bottom , the cast creates a rich and real collection of characters whose interplay is exceptionally touching . it would be unfair to complete a review of wrestling ernest hemingway without giving the two central performances their due . harris , as usual , is bigger than life , but the role of frank calls for such a reading , and it is testemony to his craft that frank never seems pathetic . a lesser actor would have turned in a much more mannered performance , overdoing walter's habit of inspecting his beloved bacon sandwiches before eating them . their screenwriter and director force them to jump through some unnecessary hoops , but when they're left to do their own thing , wrestling ernest hemingway becomes an appealing drama about the need for contact . 
screenplay : d . v . producers : tim bevan and rudd simmons . director : stephen frears . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 110 minutes . at first glance , there's every reason to believe john cusack is the ideal cast for rob gordon , the protagonist of high fidelity . few actors could pull off the amount of narration required of rob without becoming instantly annoying ; even fewer could make self-absorption somewhat sympathetic . so why does cusack seem ever-so-slightly wrong in a role that should be so right ? it's not the sharp comic setting crafted by director stephen frears and a team of four writers ( adapting nick hornby's novel ) . cusack is fine as the saner center , but his co-stars are superb . black's barry is an aggressive , abrasive pedant who delights in the power of dispensing arcana or withholding a rare record ; louiso's dick is a portrait in awed fan-geek deference . it's not the focus on rob's relationship history , either . the gimmicky casting is occasionally distracting , but not so much so that it overwhelms the strengths of the individual episodes . there's even some charming wisdom in high fidelity's acknowledgement that middle school make-out sessions can stay with you for life , or that a skillfully made mix tape can speak from the heart . no , the one key problem with an otherwise thoroughly entertaining film is that cusack's screen persona is just too . . . nice . rob is a somewhat unreliable narrator , since it is gradually revealed that he's caused just as much emotional damage as has been done to him . combine his romantic irresponsibility with his musical snobbery , and you've got a character that should be played with more jerkish , immature edge . with cusack , the nice guy is too dominant . rob's confessions -- which should have played as calculated attempts to win us to his side -- feel more like guileless soul-baring coming from cusack's mouth . and they never quite feel right . it's only then that you can feel enthusiastic about wishing for rob's happiness . high fidelity's sharp wit could have made up for a multitude of sins , when in fact it only has to make up for one ; there's more than enough quality film-making to weigh in the film's favor . there's also that nagging realiation that rob's not the good-natured hero we all want him to be when john cusack is playing the part . cusack has proven himself to be a talented , versatile actor , but there's a guy we've come to know and love in off-beat romantic comedies like the sure thing , say anything and grosse pointe blank , and it's hard not to listen to cusack reveal personal traumas without expecting that guy . even when high fidelity is at its most inspired , you can tell that rob gordon isn't that guy . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
producers : brooke breton and bonne radford . mpaa rating : pg ( mild profanity , adult themes ) running time : 85 minutes . in the last decade or so , animated feature film-making has not just risen from the dead , it has become the most consistently reliable hollywood genre for creative entertainment . compare the unqualified artistic successes ( beauty and the beast , toy story , toy story 2 , a bug's life , the iron giant ) and solid entertainments ( antz , aladdin , the prince of egypt ) with the out-and-out duds ( quest for camelot , the king and i . . . pretty much everything from warner bros . _except_ the iron giant , actually ) , and you'll find a batting average any studio would kill for . the " disney model " has led to films from several studios in which strong scripts and genuine creative energy generate -- pardon the cliche -- fun for the whole family . it's easy to visualize a live-action version of the road to el dorado as a colossal failure , clumsily mixing whimsy with huge production values . the animated version , however , manages a multitude of charms . in any number of ways , the road to el dorado does feel like a too-obvious attempt to mimic disney's 1990s animated output . like the lion king , the film combines a hans zimmer score with songs by elton john and lyricist tim rice , among them the catchy ( if not instantly hummable ) " the trail we blaze " and " it's tough to be a god . " there's even a disney voice veteran in kevin kline , who previously worked on the hunchback of notre dame . the basic story progression is familiar , and the obligatory musical numbers are feeling a bit more obligatory all the time . it's pretty fair to say that the road to el dorado doesn't do anything radically different than the dozen or so disney animated features that have preceded it . then again , why mess with success ? the makers of the road to el dorado seem to understand that telling a good story with wit and excitement will be enough to satisfy virtually anyone . they begin with a pair of roguishly likeable protagonists -- well-performed by kline and branagh and splendidly animated -- who carry the story effectively . directors bibo bergeron and will finn lead them through a series of wild , high-spirited action sequences , unobtrusively combining computer-generated details and traditional cel animation . and the script and the character animation provide more hearty laughs than a dozen recent live-action comedies . sure , there's a formula to the road to el dorado , but it rarely seems like those involved are content to let their film feel formulaic . within the constraints of their genre , everyone is working to keep the film lively and appealing . the road to el dorado certainly isn't the most inspired animated film to come down the pike . the character development is a bit sketchy , the villainous tzekel-kan doesn't get enough time to show his villainy and even a toned-down rosie perez is still rosie perez . it's not a dazzling visual spectacle , and it's not going to move anyone to tears . it is , however , the kind of sturdy , generally smart film craftsmanship that shows up far more often when a world is drawn than when it's photographed . maybe it's the unique creative perspective of animators ; maybe it's the freedom inherent in creating a world from scratch . or maybe it's just one of those golden ages we here so much about but experience so rarely . the road to el dorado may not be solid gold , but it continues an impressive string of animated features worth spending your silver on . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
i wish i hadn't known so much about i'll do anything . i wish i hadn't known that it was written as a musical , and that the songs had been edited out after disastrous test screenings . i wish i hadn't found myself trying to guess where the songs would have gone , or wondering what might have been different . then maybe , just maybe , i would have enjoyed it even more than i did . as aware as i was of its bumps , i was still mostly delighted by i'll do anything , and the reason why can be summed up in two words : whittni wright . the fact is that i'll do anything shouldn't have worked at all . kavner's watching brooks schmooze in a posh restaurant ? ) , or to notice some particularly choppy editing . the hollywood satire element never really hits stride , because it doesn't hit hard enough and because the player already did it better . ullman's character sports an appalling georgia accent , and the six year time shifts don't allow for any rhyme or reason to her eventual , rather tenuous emotional state or why she spoils jeannie so terribly . there are plenty of holes in i'll do anything , and a few more might have spelled disaster . consequently , i consider it fortunate that i fell in love with whittni wright the moment she appeared on screen . wright is a magnificent jeannie , reducing matt to a whimper of " i have absolutely no idea what to do when she throws a spectacular temper tantrum on a plane . unlike so many young performers , she never struck me as overly precious or self-aware , just winningly adorable . as many times as " parent learns responsibility " stories have been done , i was still completely charmed by this one . nolte and wright are great together , and i found myself smiling almost every minute they were on screen together . as he has done in his previous films , terms of endearment and broadcast news , james l . brooks fills the screen with quirky characters and clever dialogue . joely richardson is lovely and appealing as cathy , the development exec who wants to take a stand but can't quite work up the nerve , and she uses her splayed-leg sitting position to give cathy an aura of perpetual insecurity . albert brooks is good but underused as the cocky big-budget producer , and julie kavner gets off some of the best lines as the voice of honesty . it's too bad the relationships between those characters are generally so sketchy , gutted of some of their emotion byt the removal of the production numbers . still , the one relationship that really mattered worked so well that i was tremendously forgiving . i'll do anything may not be the smoothest of rides , but nolte and wright did such a fine job of winning my heart that i was more than willing to take that ride with them . 
long have i sung the praises of bonnie hunt , one of cinema's most effortlessly entertaining comic actresses . it also always seems to be the case that her small parts have been in bad films ( with the occasional notable exception like jerry maguire ) , a phenomenon that has baffled me to no end . i ask the gods of cinema : why can't someone who brings so much to her every role find scripts that do her talents justice ? too often , i have been left unanswered . the premise almost sounds like one of those semi-supernatural romantic comedies where a beloved spouse is somehow transformed into a member of the same sex , or a daughter's boyfriend , or a houseplant . such business actually plays no part in return to me , which downplays the otherworldly element in bob and grace's relationship . duchovny is surprisingly effective as a romantic lead , and driver is growing more luminous by the day , but their romance doesn't always feel like the central point of the film . where many romantic comedies set up the protagonists in a vacuum , return to me comes dangerously close to making the protagonists themselves the vacuum . if that's the case , it's only because there's so much wonderful business going on on the periphery . she's nearly matched by james belushi as her bearish , irresponsible husband , whose propensity for swearing in front of the children is good for laughs that should feel cheap , but somehow don't . hunt and co-writer don lake craft rich , funny situations so appealing that you wish every writer took half as much care developing supporting characters . of course , many writers take more care developing main characters . with a bit of hindsight , return to me feels more hollow than it should given all the laughs it generates . hunt doesn't even seem entirely comfortable with how to build to her big payoff , following up a reunion between bob and grace with a coda that really should have preceded it . still , i'm not sure i can recall the last time i responded to a scene as shamelessly romantic as bob's timid request to hold grace's hand . i certainly don't recall the last time a writer seemed so willing to share the wealth with the punch lines . return to me is a bit ragged , a bit sloppy , a bit overly concerned with the people surrounding its heart-linked lovers . it is , however , undeniably charming in its way . i'd expect nothing less from bonnie hunt , whose own undeniable charm has gone into a love story for underappreciated comic supporting performers everywhere . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
director : errol morris . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , mild profanity ) running time : 90 minutes . we're going to have to create a new designation for errol morris , because " documentary filmmaker " just doesn't seem to cut it . yes , morris' subjects have all been real-life people in films like the thin blue line , a brief history of time and fast , cheap & out of control . it's no wonder morris' films have consistently been overlooked by the more tradition-bound documentarians of the motion picture academy . call him a maker of non-fiction films if you must . . . or simply a director . with mr . death : the rise and fall of fred a . leuchter , jr . , errol morris has given us another reason to toss out the term " documentary filmmaker " -- as striking as the film is , it sometimes feels a bit thin on background detail . while activists argue that leuchter's work for revisionist groups marks him an anti-semite , morris paints a slightly different picture . it would be a helpful bit of information in the formation of that picture for us to know that leuchter's academic background had nothing to do with engineering or chemistry , but was in fact in history . though leuchter does discuss a move by the state of massachusetts to prosecute him as an unlicensed engineer late in the film , his background would seem to be much more important than the casual inclusion morris gives it . in fact , mr . morris lets leuchter talk about himself for a very long time , but he doesn't probe . in this case , the approach leaves holes in the story . that doesn't make mr . death a failure as a film . indeed , a less-than-perfect errol morris documentary is still infinitely more watchable than most conventional documentaries . some viewers may find his stylized renderings of his subject -- leuchter the coffee addict reflected in a cup of coffee ; leuchter filmed between flashing electrodes like a modern dr . frankenstein -- distracting or inappropriate . it is surprising , however , that this may be the first morris' documentary that's more interesting as a cinematic experience than it is as a learning experience . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
producers : dino de laurentiis and martha de laurentiis . director : jonathan mostow . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , profanity ) running time : 116 minutes . i'll tell you how u-571 ends : the good guys win . i'll let on another key piece of information : when two characters are engaged in conversation during a non-combat moment , you can bet your life that there should be a bright red neon sign beneath the characters' faces that flashes the word " foreshadowing " over and over again . moral complexity ? psychology ? subtext ? u-571 is a relentless plot machine . it's narrative film-making stripped down to the barest essentials : a plot , people to move the plot forward and a director to set the pace . and he's very good at wringing every last drop of adrenaline out of his propulsive , generic tales . the emphasis should be on the word " crew , " because it's not particularly easy -- or , in fact , necessary -- to distinguish between individual crew members . the rest of the bunch either play necessary plot roles -- the radio operator ( jack noseworthy ) keeps us up to date on exactly how close to disaster our protagonists are ; the vaguely unsavory military intelligence operative ( jake weber ) is around to remind us they must succeed or die trying -- or have endearing nicknames like tank , rabbit or trigger . i have now effectively put as much time into delineating the individual characters as the screenwriters did . thank you for your time , mr . noseworthy , and here's your check . ordinarily , an action film with such a minimal concern for its human beings sets me to slumping despairingly in my seat . mostow , on the other hand , has a knack for keeping me on the edge of it . u-571 takes us from one almost-impossible situation to another , never allowing the film to rest long enough for the whole enterprise to seem shallow . there would seem to be only so many ways to make spraying water , shuddering submarines and nautical maneuvers exciting , but mostow finds every one of them . you know you're in the hands of a gifted action film-maker when you find yourself watching scenes that should have you scoffing , but instead have you cringing in anticipation . there's not a reason in the world to care about any of the people on board u-571 , except as representations of our noble fighting men . mostow managed to keep me enthralled in the fate of a sub full of puppets . of course it would have been preferable for u-571 to seem a bit more concerned with men under fire . in a way it's a throwback to the world war ii films of a bygone era , interested primarily in waving the flag for the bravery of those who whipped jerry into submission . circa 2000 , you can also add big-budget special effects and killer sound to the mix ( do yourself a favor and see it in a theater that will have you shrinking from the straining walls ) . and you can add jonathan mostow , a director who's never going to be confused with eric rohmer when it comes to exploring the nuances of the human condition . the man can keep you hanging on to your armrests , though , and that's a rare talent . u-571 doesn't take its sub to any great depths . it just keeps the boat rockin' . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
in print and television interviews , everyone associated with reality bites has been trying desperately to convince potential viewers that it's not a " generation x " movie , but just a simple romantic comedy . yeah . right . reality bites follows slacker ; singles ; and bodies , rest & motion in the sweepstakes to most accurately capture the 20-something zeitgeist , but i found it more reminiscent of star winona ryder's breakthrough film heathers . while reality bites does include some very funny moments and finely observed insight , it also tends to reduce its central characters to a collection of kitschy bon mots . reality bites is strongest on the level of details and the number of individual laughs of recognition they provide . i will admit to participating in a group sing-along of " conjunction junction " like these characters , and to playing games based on sit-com episodes . vickie is perhaps the most recognizable type to me ; i know a few people who cover their walls with old music posters and beg for you to turn up bad power pop songs with memories of junior high school dances . more so than singles , reality bites identifies the sense of ideological drift that characterizes americans in their mid-20s , but without the moody self-importance of bodies , rest & motion . this is not to say that childress doesn't also give in to easy stereotypes . every parent in reality bites is characterized by a cartoonish materialism , and becomes an easy target for blame . the romantic triangle doesn't have quite the impact it could have had because as attractive as ryder is , she doesn't seem nearly as interesting as , say , vickie . troy is an even more problematic character , a first class self-absorbed jerk who philosophizes in bastardized advertising jingles . the transformation childress tries to foist off on us is far too contrived , and she seems too willing to let troy's attitude stand as an acceptable response to the world he perceives . fortunately , they are somewhat balanced by two delightful supporting performances . comic janeane garofolo ( tv's the larry sanders show ) is hysterical as vickie , displaying a natural timing which makes the most mundane lines funny . director ben stiller is charming as lelaina's perpetually flustered suitor , and should be congratulated for risking the hesitating delivery which makes his character appear very real . i have to note that i was extremely disappointed by the ending of reality bites , but that may say more about me than about the film . while there are numerous character stumbles , overall i felt the tone was on target , and i laughed a lot . reality bites off a bit more than it can chew , but it all goes down eventually . 
producers : kevin spacey , elie samaha and andrew stevens . director : john swanbeck . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 90 minutes . raise your hand if the idea of a film version of a single-set , dialogue-heavy play sets your pulse racing . keep it up in the air if you'd like to cross that with a story about the hard-knocks life of professional salesmen . stage-to-screen translations are hard enough without dealing with the inherent limitations of a single location . and you can't imagine there's anything left to be said about salesmen that arthur miller didn't slap a copyright on fifty years ago . technical stagnancy and narrative familiarity -- yep , sign me up for a double dose of that . it's hard not to go into a film like the big kahuna without fearing the worst , which makes it all the more impressive when it turns out to be a splendid acting showcase with a few eye-opening bits of wisdom . spacey is predictably sensational as the marketing rep for whom honesty has become a religion ; there may not be a performer around who can be so pleasantly venomous . it is surprising to see devito match spacey's stride in what may be his best film performance ever . phil's voice of experience carries a regret that's almost tangible , turning his every utterance into something you trust implicitly as true and worth knowing . facinelli has the least eye-catching role , but that doesn't mean he's a week link ; it's just bob's job to listen and learn . between spacey and devito , there's enough blistering comic dialogue to keep three films afloat . there's also a surprising core of understanding in the big kahuna about the nature of salesmanship . the film's hard-nosed philosophy -- which wraps god and industrial lubricants in one not-so-tidy package -- is likely to make plenty of viewers uneasy , but it's a challenging perspective on proselytizing as a question of product , rather than process . the subject proves to be only one of several on which rueff offers insights that keep you hanging on his dialogue . it's the only way a talk-intensive film like the big kahuna can work : between the wicked wit and the provocative ideas , you're too afraid to miss something to let your attention wander . director john swanbeck does have some trouble overcoming the inherent limitations of his setting . he does include a trio of well-crafted fantasy sequences , including one that makes wonderful use of facinelli's resemblance to a certain a-list star in a sequence involving fancy bartending moves . still , it's essentially a film in which three characters take turns talking to each other , a set-up that's never going to produce the most visually arresting cinema . the only reason to watch the big kahuna is not to watch it , but to listen to it -- to absorb some fine writing and the work of actors who know what to do with it . it's enough to remind you that solid execution trumps low expectations every time . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : richard curtis . director : mike newell . where romantic comedy is concerned , i am a tough sell . too many of them seem to put across the impression that all you need to do is put two people on the screen and have them end up together , regardless of whether or not they are developed with an interesting conflict ( or even speak to one another , as in the monstrously overhyped sleepless in seattle ) . i'm not going to turn into a pile of goo every time i see a screen kiss , but i will respond if i've spent two hours with two well-developed characters who seem to belong together . the new british comedy four weddings and a funeral delivers only halfway . hugh grant turns in a charming , star-making performance in this uneven character piece , but andie macdowell always appears to be more of a prop than a person . four weddings and a funeral was written by richard curtis , co-creator of the popular british television import " black adder , " a series not renowned for its sentimentality . and four weddings is extremely winning when it's not focusing on relationships . there are enough of these lively set pieces that four weddings rarely lags for too long , and the laughs come at fairly regular intervals . part of the problem is that in an attempt to create yet another ensemble friends piece he overloads the film with supporting characters , giving short shrift to the crucial relationship between charles and carrie . only james fleet , as befuddled aristocrat tom , provides any spark to the proceedings . the simple fact is that i kept losing track of the relationships between all these people , and didn't particularly care when i could figure them out . this lack of focus is inexcusable considering the cursory treatment carrie's character is given . part of four weddings and a funeral's message about love is that we should all be looking for that one person who makes " lightning strike , " and while the romantic sentiment is laudable it also assumes that we as an audience should recognize it when we see it . hugh grant , looking frighteningly like harold lloyd in his horn-rims , is an absolute delight ; he turns charles into a wonderful , funny , fallible character , and we want to see him happy . but carrie is simply a plot device . we know virtually nothing about her except that charles has a crush on her , and andie macdowell is not subtle enough an actress to fill in the blanks . it also might have been helpful to understand charles' romantic history better , which could have been accomplished through a more complete picture of ex-girlfriend henrietta , but that too is absent . there is much to recommend four weddings and a funeral as a comedy ; it's bright and spirited and well-paced . as a romance , it leaves much to be desired . . . primarily a second party for the romantic pairing . 
screenplay : alfred gough & miles millar . director : tom dey . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , profanity , drug use ) running time : 110 minutes . jackie chan in another buddy action-comedy -- now there's something i didn't think i ever needed to see again . sure , the formula proved extremely successful in 1998's $141 million hit rush hour . it also meant jackie chan fans had to endure the human audio torture device that is chris tucker , and that studios would persist in their foolish perception that american audiences might not embrace a film with chan as its solo star . shanghai noon looked like a disaster waiting to happen -- formula piled upon formula , cheap gag piled upon cheap gag , jackie chan in another buddy action-comedy . the quirky actor does something few actors have the ability to do : he can make you forget you're watching a formula film . there is something so instantly and immensely likable about chan that it's almost unfair that he's also so physically gifted . his stunt work is again in top form in shanghai noon , finding more creative props for chan to use as weapons against his foes : saplings , moose horns , horseshoes , a railroad log car , etc . director tom dey and editor richard chew don't do chan's work optimum justice -- too many sequences are chopped up when it has proved infinitely smarter over the years to let the camera sit still and watch chan at work -- but they still possess that unique capacity to dazzle . a movie fight sequence is usually an obligatory piece of action business ; a jackie chan fight sequence is the reason you never want to leave your seat during the action . and owen wilson is the reason you never want to leave your seat during the exposition . his o'bannon is a great , goofy comic creation , a big talker whose primary reason for being in the outlaw game appears to be impressing women . any number of actors probably could have pulled off that characterization , but it's far more difficult to give it the strangely off-hand charm wilson provides . his performance cashes in on the incongruity of his surfer-casual line readings , but it never depends on that incongruity . there's just something unexpectedly funny about the way wilson handles even the most mundane , predictable moments . i spent half of rush hour pleading for chris tucker to get off the screen so i could enjoy jackie chan . no such problems in shanghai noon -- i felt a silly grin plastered across my face no matter which actor was being showcased . if the raw material of shanghai noon had been stronger , it could have been a truly inspired comedy . writers alfred gough and miles millar pump some clever lines into the script , but it's still a bit too dependent on making fun of the names pei pei and chon wang ( or rib-nudgingly naming one nasty cowboy van cleef ) . then there are the lumbering plot development scenes , including references to chinese railroad labor that seems included primarily for a sense of anachronistic moral superiority . in fact , the entire premise feels like a grand distraction from the appeal of the two stars , whose work individually and as a team blows the material away . i'm not sure what sort of setting might have served them better , and it almost feels like quibbling to wonder . chan and wilson simply make shanghai noon loads of fun . it's the sort of buddy action-comedy that wipes some of the stigma away from the term . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : karey kirkpatrick . mpaa rating : g running time : 85 minutes . nick park's three wallace and gromit shorts for aardman animation -- a grand day out , the wrong trousers and a close shave -- are examples of inspired , brilliant film-making . park's feature film debut -- chicken run , co-directed with peter lord -- is not . sometimes it's hard to accept simple quality when you've come to expect genius ; i suspect i'll cry a river of tears when john lasseter finally produces a film that's merely good . chicken run is unlike virtually any other animated film you're likely to see this summer , and not just because the characters are manipulated pieces of clay instead of drawings or cgi creations . it's an appealing , well-crafted film with a unique sensibility and a few wonderfully imaginative scenes . and its script can't manage one-tenth of the wit verbally that the rest of the film creates visually . after all , if rocky can fly , he can surely teach the chicks of tweedy farm a thing or two about getting airborne . the broad structure of chicken run is a satire of world war ii pow films -- ginger and her pals are " inmates " of coop 17 -- but the genre gags form only a tiny part of the film . the rest of the narrative involves a fairly banal bickering relationship between ginger and rocky , occasionally jazzed up by a nod to the love-hate relationship between brits and yanks . the dialogue could have stuck to that angle for its humor , but screenwriter karey kirkpatrick instead opts for a seemingly endless litany of ghastly puns . gibson , sawalha and many of the other performers do energetic voice work , despite the absence of much energy devoted to developing characters . as long as the characters are flapping their beaks , chicken run is fairly limp stuff . that chicken run soars highest when it's silent probably comes as no surprise to wallace and gromit devotees , who know that park has a gift for elaborately constructed sight gags . chicken run's finest moments showcase that gift , from the opening credits montage of ginger's unsuccessful escape attempts to the climactic mid-air showdown with mrs . tweedy . in between , there's the deliriously funny sequence in which rocky comes to ginger's rescue when she's strapped into an automated chicken pot pie-making machine . the clockwork comic timing is vintage nick park , with the nods to raiders of the lost ark actually underplayed so that they simply add flavor to an already priceless set piece . and then there are tiny pleasures like a teapot disguised as a hen , and a group of hens in a synchronized tai chi display . the depth and texture of the clay-mation world is satisfying enough ; the things the film-makers do with that world are a joy to behold . there's nothing about the aardman style that demands the animated equivalent of silent film storytelling ; the classic short creature comforts wedded person-on-the-street dialogue with clay critters to charming effect . this particular story , however , has the processed flavor of a dozen other animated films . the characters never get enough chance to develop the personality gromit packs into one furrowing of his plasticine brow , because they're too busy clucking off kirkpatrick's one-line groaners . i'm thoroughly convinced nick park has a positively glorious feature film in him -- perhaps it's the wallace and gromit feature planned for a few years hence -- but this one isn't quite it . it's an entertaining warm-up , a few bits of brilliance packed in disposable kiddie fluff . in short , it's simply good . when you've got a genius at your disposal , that's not quite good enough . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
me , myself & irene ( 20th century fox ) starring : jim carrey , renee zellweger , chris cooper , robert forster , richard jenkins , anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon . screenplay : peter farrelly & mike cerrone & bobby farrelly . directors : bobby farrelly & peter farrelly . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , sexual situations , violence ) running time : 116 minutes . the national alliance for the mentally ill went public ten days before the release of me , myself & irene with a protest of the film's flippant tone towards multiple personality disorders . they were offended , which is not an uncommon reaction to a farrelly brothers movie . in fact , it was probably a shrewd move on nami's part to beat the rush condemning me , myself & irene . farrelly brothers movies -- including kingpin and there's something about mary -- are tasteless , crude and , yes , occasionally offensive . they're also funny in the sort of i-can't-believe-i-actually-saw-that way usually associated with vintage mel brooks , or the zucker-abrahams-zucker team . there's nothing remotely ennobling about me , myself & irene , the story of charlie baileygates ( jim carrey ) , a rhode island state trooper with a little problem . fans of there's something about mary -- and i count myself quite squarely among them -- may find irene a bit disappointing by comparison . carrey and zellweger aren't nearly the perfect comic odd couple ben stiller and cameron diaz were , nor is carrey the sort of comic performer whose ordinary guy demeanor works to balance the farrellys' warped sensibilities . the story is an unnecessarily convoluted parade of double-crossing characters involved in a dirty business deal the specific nature of which i still can't explain . there are a few missed opportunities , like ignoring genial narrator rex allen , jr . for much of the film . and like the farrellys' previous films , it's easily 15 minutes longer than it needs to be , padded with musical cues that only distract from the real reason for watching a farrelly brothers movie : seeing what gut-busting affront to good taste they'll come up with next . mere words can't possibly do justice to those affronts . irene's finest moments may not reach the epic heights of mary's zipper or hair gel scenes , but they come close . sometimes it seems that it's a long time between laughs in a farrelly brothers movie , but maybe that's a good thing . often , you still haven't recovered from the last one five minutes ago by the time the next one rolls around . i'm not about to delve into whether or not nami was " right " in criticizing irene for its approach to multiple personality disorder , including repeatedly using " schizo " as a synonym . i do know that me , myself & irene strikes me as a wildly comic spin on the incredible hulk more than anything else , with carrey's contorted transformations a special effect all by themselves . that's only part of the amazingly adept physical comedy carrey pulls off , battling with his own body like steve martin in all of me . . . or , come to think of it , like carrey himself in liar liar . me , myself & irene may be uneven and peculiarly violent in its resolution , but it's pure in its refusal to sentimentalize anything . everything is profane and nothing sacred in the farrelly universe . maybe that is worth protesting . or maybe , when you're laughing so hard that you forget to be offended , it's worth applauding . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay/director : guillermo del toro . horror films with any semblance of wit or style are so rare that i'm tempted to be even warmer in my embrace of cronos than my head tells me to be . this mexican import puts a unique spin on its tale of a search for eternal life , features some extremely arresting imagery and has a nicely twisted sense of humor . yet as much as i admired the artistry of cronos , i couldn't help but notice a gaping hole at the center , namely a central character who steadfastly refused to engender any sympathy . a viewer willing to overlook its lack of heart will be rewarded by a project full of a new director's excitement at being allowed to realize his vision . thanks to the half-dozen or so credits which precede the title , cronos reportedly boasts the second highest budget in mexican film history ( behind only like water for chocolate ) , and guillermo del toro leaves it all on the screen . true , the make-up effects seem cheesy by modern standards , but elsewhere cronos sports a high polish . also noteworthy is the cronos device itself , and del toro's creative use of it , including showing its elaborate inner workings . director of photography guillermo navarro shoots the film with an emphasis on big spaces , and the result is a deliciously spooky atmosphere . for all its visual flair , cronos may be most satisfying on the level of del toro's off-beat sense of humor . guillermo del toro manages to put a lot of bite into his script , in more ways than one . there is that one big problem , though : jesus gris is completely bland . del toro doesn't connect jesus' fate with his character in any noticeable way ; in fact , it might be a stretch to say that jesus has a character . with his ultra-symbolic name , you would assume that there might be some attempt to go deeper into the psychology of his " resurrection . " but there is no sense of who he was before his experience with the cronos device , and more early characterization would have been extremely useful . i also had problems with aurora , whose placid response to bizarre events is stylized but ultimately tedious . of course , style is ultimately cronos' strongest asset , and it's very strong at that . guillermo del toro has said that he only wants to make horror films . with a bit of seasoning as a writer , these projects could prove well worth anticipating for the thinking fright fan . 
producers : george faber and charles patterson . director : roger michell . mpaa rating : unrated ( could be r for profanity , violence and adult themes ) running time : 101 minutes . it's a small bit of business , only one of many in the film , but it shows how interested director roger michell and screenwriter anne devlin ( working from mary costello's autobiographical novel ) are with establishing character . over the course of the film , bernie becomes a bona fide political celebrity , though not a much-beloved one . what's extraordinary about bernie is that she's so un-extraordinary . she's simply a house-proud mother concerned more with keeping her kids alive than making a statement . this simple focus on a simple but very determined woman helps titanic town avoid the most common pitfall of films set against a political struggle : it never stops to lecture about the futility of war or to make any other grandiose statement about the events that form its backdrop . walters delivers a witty , thoroughly engaging performance as bernie , who stumbles into a position as spokesperson by sheer accident . bernie is such a solid center of the film that its sub-plots often feel fairly thin by comparison . nothing else in the film is ever quite as compelling . that one story is still compelling enough to keep titanic town moving briskly , and to offer a vivid insight into the chaos of 1970s belfast . films about big issues need those small moments to keep them human . titanic town is never the monolith its title might suggest . tragedy sometimes appears in a form less like a sinking ship than like an unmade bed . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : christopher mcquarrie . director : christopher mcquarrie . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 119 minutes . the way of the gun -- the directing debut by oscar-winning screenwriter christopher mcquarrie ( the usual suspects ) -- opens the way you always hope a film will open : with so much energy and potential that the whole theater seems electrified . the scene is violent , profane , surprising and hilarious . as a tone-setter , it's marvelous ; as a stand-alone piece of writing and directing , it's hella-fun . filled with individual moments of loopy creativity , genuinely unsettling violence and wicked dialogue , the way of the gun should have been one of the best films of the year ( though in a painfully lackluster 2000 , it still has a shot at that dubious honor ) . the only reason it's not is a fundamental narrative miscalculation on mcquarrie's part : there's no good reason for parker and longbaugh to be the film's ostensible protagonists . for at least the first half-hour , the way of the gun is so skillfully rendered that it seems destined for glory . from parker and longbaugh's torment of a clerk at a sperm bank , to the unconventional staging of the kidnapping itself , to the splendid slow-speed chase that follows , mcquarrie twists the crime caper genre 90 degrees at virtually every opportunity . even playing the tarantino comparison card doesn't entirely do justice to mcquarrie's ability to throw a wrench into expectations . the connections between the characters become evident only after a bit of reflection ; there's no guarantee that bad-asses still won't get their bad asses kicked , or that those who appear likely to take the most punishment might not end up dishing it out . it's almost never exactly what you expect it to be . and , in at least one case , that's not exactly a compliment . mcquarrie , however , never seems aware of that fact . telling the story largely from their perspective isn't a celebration of the anti-hero ; it's a narrative blunder . is that blunder enough to throw the way of the gun entirely off course ? fortunately not . mcquarrie's compositions are unusually rich for a writer-turned-director -- watch for mrs . chidduck appearing in the background and at the edge of the frame -- yet he still ends on a kicker of a line of dialogue . the only thing missing from the way of the gun is soul , the soul that would have been provided by sarno as its center . it's a good film that's a 90 degree twist away from greatness -- the one 90 degree twist mcquarrie didn't take . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : john richards and james flamberg . director : neil labute . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , sexual situations ) running time : 110 minutes . there's something particularly delightful -- and subversive -- about a high-concept comedy that turns into something resonant . groundhog day could have been ridiculous and repetitive , but it charmed you with an unexpectedly touching romance ; being john malkovich could have been a simplistic tale of misguided celebrity worship , but it turned into an absurdist existential fantasy worthy of ionesco . hollywood excels at selling stories in a single sentence , and we come to expect that we know all there is to know about the film from that sentence . when it becomes evident that there's more to a film than its marketing-savvy premise , it's a heart-warming experience indeed . nurse betty isn't as thematically rich as either groundhog day or being john malkovich , and it's certainly not as thematically rich as director neil labute's dazzling debut in the company of men . it is , however , a peculiarly entertaining comedy that sticks in the brain for a while longer than you expect . it's entirely possible that nurse betty could have succeeded as a comedy strictly on the basis of its wild premise . labute directs with effective comic short-hand -- a scene portraying del in the middle of an affair with his secretary shows wear marks on the wall to emphasize his recidivist philandering -- and paces his showpiece sequences with a flair you might not expect from the misanthropic mind behind in the company of men . there are sharp visual gags like betty's perky look in her bloody nurse's outfit after performing an impromptu medical procedure , and slick exchanges of dialogue between charley and wesley . the performances are not uniformly appealing -- rock yells without doing much acting , and eckhart's mullet-headed lout of a husband is as broad a stereotype as you'll find - but the work by zellweger , freeman and kinnear more than takes up the slack . it's simply a funny comedy . simply funny , but far from simplistic . nurse betty takes the somewhat trite notion of soap operas as vicarious life for those with unhappy lives and twists it into provocative knots . the resolution may come to some obvious conclusions about the need to face reality , but along the way it shows a respect for the complexity of our coping mechanisms , whatever form they may take . with so much strong stuff at the center , it's a shame that nurse betty gets flabby around the edges . the attempts at entertainment industry satire don't always mesh with the edgier stuff , and the tone shifts from intense to playful on a dime . in fact , by all rights it should be just another affably mediocre piece of hollywood joke-mongering . yet even with its bumps and scrapes , nurse betty feels like more . there's something at stake , something recognizably human , something you don't often find in high-concept comedy . thanks to zellweger , freeman and ( of all people ) neil labute , there's a heart here , and a brain , too . it's an approach that takes a high concept just a bit higher . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
best in show ( warner bros . ) starring : christopher guest , eugene levy , catherine o'hara , parker posey , michael hitchcock , michael mckean , john michael higgins , jennifer coolidge , jane lynch , fred willard . screenplay : christopher guest and eugene levy . director : christopher guest . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , adult humor ) running time : 88 minutes . you have to believe that christopher guest is a smart enough guy to realize he's setting himself up for some tough comparisons . the legendary mock documentary this is spinal tap , co-starring and co-written by guest , is making a return appearance to theaters to remind viewers that it was the funniest comedy of the 1980s ; guest also co-wrote and directed waiting for guffman , another very funny mock documentary . it's a format that's been good for guest , and you can't blame him for returning to the well , especially when venturing outside it to direct has resulted in garbage like the chris farley/matthew perry debacle almost heroes . how many mock documentaries can one director fit on the head of a pin ? best in show is a very entertaining film comedy on a pure laugh meter , but it's missing something spinal tap and guffman both had to spare : a real perspective on its subject , and genuine affection for its characters . as has been the case in guest's other mockumentaries , best in show starts with some broadly comic characters to get the gags rolling . lots of the dialogue -- much of it obviously improvised -- is hilarious , especially when it involves absurdities like harlan's interest in ventriloquism or gerry's ( literal ) two left feet . if you just sit back and listen , the laughs will keep coming . the laughs should have been richer , however , and there's a reason they're not . in spinal tap and guffman , the broad characters were only the starting point for people that eventually became much more human and sympathetic as we come to understand their world . guest never seems nearly as interested in the complexities of his characters or their world in best in show . there's no sense for why people become so obsessed with putting their pets through the show-dog grind , no real affection for their quirks or insecurities . in fact , he plays downright nasty with sheri ann and the swans in particular , making them fairly grotesque caricatures . there's a sense that guest has picked a milieu where he knew there would be a lot of weird people , and decided simply to wring the laughs out of their weirdness . there are plenty of laughs to be wrung out of that weirdness , fortunately , and even more to be wrung from the show itself . best in show gets a tremendous boost once fred willard shows up as the mayflower show's loud-mouthed announcer buck laughlin , whose inane questions for his flustered british co-host provide nearly non-stop laughs . laughlin is also one of the few characters whose ridiculousness is accompanied by a wink ; he's a guy doing a job he's utterly unqualified for , embarrassing himself while trying to make the best of it . willard is brilliant , and the rest of best in show is still pretty funny . it's simply funny in a slightly more mean-spirited way , making it harder to embrace unreservedly . guest has scored again , but this time there's a less welcome sort of " mock " in his mock documentary . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : rod lurie . director : rod lurie . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 125 minutes . it's clear that lurie has a lot of interesting things say about contemporary american politics on a national level . it's equally clear that he still has a few things to learn about turning those things into smoothly satisfying film stories . questions regarding the pertinence of private life to public service have certainly been part of the political landscape in recent years , making the contender's subject matter timely food for thought . oldman makes for a superb antagonist as the cutthroat runyon , whose motivations are always swaying between genuine conviction that hanson isn't ready for the job and retribution for earlier political losses to the president . there are fine moments exploring the slippery slopes on which politicians walk in order to gain power , none more effective than a scene in which hanson -- armed with information that could allow her to make an effective personal attack on runyon -- is forced to decide whether or not to use it . the excruciatingly long silence in that scene says more about the tension between principle and expedience than any line of dialogue . that's also one of the few moments in the contender when lurie nails the timing of a scene . throughout the film , there's a sense that virtually every scene is about a minute too short , that virtually every character or sub-plot has been short-changed in some fashion . hanson herself remains enigmatic through much of the film , robbing the film of a real protagonist for the audience to embrace . and lurie sticks too closely to the insider wheelings and dealings , never venturing into the realm of public opinion to explore how scandals affect the public . the contender has the scope of an epic political drama without enough of the detail . fortunately for lurie , he scores several points for detail with jeff bridges' performance as president evans . plenty of actors have essayed portrayals of american presidents with an emphasis either on sheer authoritative presence or flawed humanity . bridges nails both , switching from genial charm to icy political determination in the blink of an eye . it's a near-perfect piece of film acting , capturing every one of a modern chief executive's many faces ; he even gives a kick to the obligatory climactic preachy-speechy . that's the only bit of greatness the contender can muster , however ; it's otherwise a merely solid piece of drama . perhaps next time around , rod lurie will pick up a few lessons from bridges on putting all the pieces together around a persuasive ideological core . such is the stuff of a great leader , whether behind the camera , or behind the desk in the oval office . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
or it's a huge , sick joke at the audience's expense . or maybe it's both . you can't really put any motivation past lars von trier , a director whose fondness for rendering his own name in block letters four times larger than the film's title belies a certain streak of ego . this is a man who decided to write the rules for a new aesthetic of minimalist cinema with his dogme '95 manifesto , then proceeded to break all those rules by making a live-action musical . it has become clear that you can predict virtually nothing about the way von trier will try to make a movie , except that it will inspire extreme emotions . you may want to gasp , or cry , or smack him silly for dragging you along on his exercises in self-indulgence . only musicals can temporarily distract selma from her mission -- watching one in a movie theater , performing in one in a local theatrical production , or imagining that the world around her is turning into one when life gets particularly grim . the grimness of selma's life is rendered in von trier's favored washed-out morph of film and digital video -- big risk #1 -- but it's a tactical blunder for this particular script . dancer in the dark is fashioned as a melodrama , with developments that pit our morally pure heroine against dastardly forces . on glossy celluloid , such an old-fashioned narrative approach might have worked . the hand-held , documentary-style of dancer in the dark , however , demands a level of depth in the characters' motivations and relationships that isn't always there . that's time that could have been much better spent on the underdeveloped relationship between selma and gene , which should be central to the film . it would have been possible to turn selma's conflicted motivations into a compelling plot point . instead , it's still often dizzying , chilling and more engrossing than virtually any other film this year . big risk #2 was the casting of bjork as selma , and it's hard to do justice to how extraordinary her performance is . while her less-than-authentic czech accent occasionally distracts , she hits every emotional note with such resonance that it's painful to watch her . and as painful as it is to watch , it's equally impossible not to watch when big risk #3 -- the musical production numbers -- kicks in . they're rendered as brightly-colored interpretations of selma's interior life , inspired by the natural rhythms of a train's wheels , machinery and a record's run-out groove . undoubtedly some viewers will find it impossible to get past the contrivance , or past bjork's distinctive yodeling vocals . others will be transfixed by the image of a killer fantasizing the forgiveness of the victim , or the most abruptly concluded musical number in film history . many critics have already noted that dancer in the dark bears more than a passing resemblance to von trier's 1996 film breaking the waves in its focus on the trials of a beatific female martyr . indeed , selma's sacrifice is not set up nearly so convincingly as that of emily watson's bess , which can only make dancer seem to suffer by comparison . that doesn't diminish what von trier is able to accomplish this time around with another spectacular performance and more giddy disregard for expectations and conventions . dancer in the dark is a deeply flawed narrative that becomes a long sit during its third act ; it's also studded with several moments of jaw-dropping brilliance . it's the work of a director who'll do anything to inspire a reaction . in a world of overly sanitized cinema , it's hard to dismiss that kind of raw nerve . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
directors : roger allers and rob minkoff . there is a yin to every yang , and if there is a down side to the remarkable success of disney's recent animated features , it's that the mouse keeps upping the ante for every subsequent feature . most likely . while not as emotional as beauty or as fast-paced as aladdin , the lion king is genuinely entertaining , with moments of truly stunning visual creativity . only weakness in the music and a fractured tone hamper the proceedings . like the last three big disney hits , the lion king is a musical , but it probably shouldn't have been . elton john and aladdin lyricist tim rice have provided five new songs , but nothing has the sparkle of the menken/ashman compositions , and for the most part the production numbers seem more obligatory than inspired . " i just can't wait to be king " is a silly , gaudy bit , and " hakuna matata " is a recycled " bare necessities . " it also features a chilling sequence with goose-stepping hyenas parading past scar against a subtle background with images of swastikas . hans zimmer's afro-tinged arrangements and incidental score make the most of the music , but the lion king is much more effective when the story is spoken rather than sung . the story is a somber one , an animated " hamlet " of sorts , and frequently the animation matches that tone . these sequences might be less than entrancing to the very young , but they are offset by lively , funny sequences featuring timon and pumbaa . nathan lane gives timon a bugs bunny cockiness which is charming , and ernie sabella is equally endearing as the affably flatulent warthog . nala's pursuit of pumbaa is the film's comic highlight , but the action in the lion king tends to be more serious . parents should exercise some judgment regarding taking children under six . none of this is to suggest that the lion king plods along humorlessly . timon and pumbaa get the most to work with , but they are ably assisted by the other supporting characters . scar , while sinister , gets of some dark one-liners ; robert guillaume has a small but goofy bit as a yoda-like baboon . as zasu , a hornbill who serves as mufasa's chancellor and simba's chaperone , he gets a fussy part that's a cross between the little mermaid's sebastian and beauty and the beast's cogsworth , but atkinson's droll delivery makes it his own ( and provides the single biggest laugh with a shot at one of disney's most annoying songs ) . the lion king is not a masterpiece ; it is too slow at times , and has perhaps too many characters to juggle . still , it is witty and beautifully drawn , and is sure to continue disney's amazing animated winning streak . 
this just in : the sincere romantic drama is not extinct . make no mistake , it's on the endangered species list ; in this oh-so-ironic era , sincerity sightings have been akin to those blurry shots of the loch ness monster and hubcap-like flying saucers . you don't expect mainstream movies to deliver romantic stories that seem grounded in genuine feelings , and you certainly don't expect it from don roos , who wrote and directed the attitude-laden the opposite of sex . nevertheless , here comes bounce offering that rarest of y2k big-screen commodities : an adult relationship with some real emotion . it starts out , however , like a typical high-concept trifle . the surprise is that the relationship never feels like a wacky contrivance . roos is a smart writer with a nose for full characterizations , and the story development as a whole rarely feels manipulated for the convenience of the plot ( see below for notable exception ) . he steps back as a director from some of the most potentially exploitative moments , and injects his sharp wit in places where it works organically ( particularly in the person of johnny galecki as buddy's assistant ) . though it's a romance with some humor , it never ignores the basic sadness in both buddy and abby's lives that gives resonance to their connection . though it's a romance with tragic elements , it never wallows in the tragedy so much that it turns into melodrama . bounce could have been a true gem of a film if the leads had been more evenly matched as actors . gwyneth paltrow is one of those performers who appears doomed to be scorned and underappreciated for her talent as long as she is still young and attractive , but let's get this straight : she's a damned good actress . in bounce , she's once again wonderful , capturing abby's strength and vulnerability . affleck , on the other hand , still has some growing to do as an actor . he's not a bad actor , but he still carries himself on screen primarily with a swagger , even when he's supposed to be emotionally wounded . buddy the charming cad is a role affleck can make appealing in his sleep . not only does it once again place affleck in the unfortunate position of getting all mega-serious on us , it's also the only time bounce starts to feel like something that could only happen in a movie . there's nothing inherently wrong with romantic dramas that take on that an affair to remember-style sense of heightened tragedy . it's just so unusual when a film gives you the opportunity to explore romantic complications more simply . bounce makes it's share of mistakes , but it's always clear that its heart is in the right place . how refreshing to spend time with a film willing to show you its heart at all . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : m . night shyamalan . director : m . night shyamalan . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , violence , profanity ) running time : 107 minutes . [warning : the following review contains elements that may be considered plot spoilers . those who wish to see the film without any knowledge of plot developments beyond those contained in its trailers should not read this review . ] m . night shyamalan's unbreakable easily qualifies as the strangest , most subdued and most unconventional super-hero movie ever made . it will probably be considered something of a plot spoiler simply to make such a declaration , since shyamalan and touchstone pictures have made such a concerted effort to build a mystery around what exactly unbreakable is about . but there you have it : it's a super-hero movie . a moody , character-driven super-hero movie . with no costumes or action figures . no explosions . and no crash-cut editing . it's a super-hero movie as directed by m . night shyamalan , the anti-joel shumacher . in many ways , unbreakable's story is the quintessential modern super-hero story . what shyamalan does is wrap the archetypal mythology in psychology and family drama . he harbors long-suppressed unhappiness over the life he may have given up for his family , unhappiness willis generally conveys through the raspy whisper he uses in his serious dramatic actor mode . willis , jackson , penn and clark all play fully-developed characters , which makes unbreakable a rare enough film in that it's genuinely concerned not just with situations , but with people responding to situations . and yet it's still indisputably , undeniably a super-hero movie , though unlike any super-hero movie you've ever seen before . shyamalan's style is unusal for a director in any genre , one that favors long , unbroken takes over quick cuts and reversals . that style contributed greatly to the powerful aura of mystery in shyamalan's the sixth sense , and it contributes here to a sense of greater consequence than you'd expect from a tale of a super-powered man learning how to fight evil . the moment in which david and joseph jointly discover david's unusual strength is played with a light sense of humor and a truly under-stated sense of awe ; david's climactic encounter with a villain is shot in a way that makes heroic triumph surprisingly ugly . as visually gifted as shyamalan is as a filmmaker -- perhaps even showy in his way -- unbreakable never lets a special effect or a camera trick take over this narrative . unbreakable takes a couple of unfortunate wrong turns during its third act . the other involves a late plot development that's not nearly as organic to the story as the sixth sense's already-legendary twist . it feels almost obligatory , as though shyamalan were under the impression that it's what the audience expects from him now . that seems an unlikely prospect , though , considering how blithely he goes about blowing up every expectation you've ever had about a super-hero movie . unbreakable is a compelling , fundamentally sound story that feels more and more daring until its late stumbles . it's too bad that the final moments are so weak , because it might leave viewers doubting its other impressive accomplishments . this is a film that emerges from its own internal conflicts ultimately triumphant -- just like a strange , subdued , unconventional super-hero movie should . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
since i began reviewing films , no film has left me as stumped as forrest gump . while i was watching , i was carried away , delighted by an original and stunningly executed experience . but almost as soon as the closing credits started to roll , i began to feel that something just wasn't working . forrest gump is , by turns , hilarious , overly precious , touching and disturbingly simplistic . so the question becomes , which forrest gump do i review : the in-the-theater experience , or the in-the-car experience ? the undeniably entertaining crowd-pleaser or the pre-digested primer in pop philosophy ? naturally , i found my answer somewhere in the middle . tom hanks plays the title character , an alabama naif with an iq of 75 but a heart of gold . there is little question that the craft of forrest gump is a wonder to behold . the digital wizards at ilm have triumphed again with the sequences placing forrest in footage with presidents kennedy , johnson and nixon , as well as george wallace and john lennon . perhaps even more impressive are the shots in which gary sinise is made to appear a double amputee . yet for all the notice- grabbing visuals , it was the sound that blew me away . one vietnam battle scene will shock you out of your seat , and the sound of a hurricane is equally stunning . this is not say that director robert zemeckis rests on his technical support . forrest gump never fails to be a feast for the senses . it's also frequently a feast for the funny bone , but unfortunately zemeckis succumbs to the same tendency that sometimes hampered who framed roger rabbit ? , namely a desire to throw in too many winking cultural asides . the biggest laughs are purely character moments , such as forrest discovering his speed while blowing apart his leg braces , or the rambling shrimp-based menu delivered by forrest's army buddy bubba . at a certain point , it's just overkill , and it detracts from the whimsical tone with its heavy-elbowed nudges . tom hanks' performance as forrest is problematic . while he avoids most of the one-note traps of dustin hoffman in rain man , he is still far too mannered , particularly when compared to the dynamic naturalistic performances of co-stars robin wright and gary sinise . wright delivers a wrenching performance worthy of high praise , and sinise may have found the role which makes him a household name ( if the stand didn't already do so ) . hanks may garner yet another academy award nomination , but he was better in a comparable role in big , and for my money even better in his much criticized performance in philadelphia . my biggest problem with forrest gump is that in its attempt to re-construct america's turbulent last thirty years , it has created a philosphical monster . gump has most often been compared to 1979's being there , but there is a critical difference . jerzy kozinski created a biting satire of how the platitudes of a dim-witted man became wisdom in a sound-bite society . there is no such distance in forrest gump ; forrest's bon mots * are * the film's philosophy , and as such they seem like truth mcnuggets . gump may be a paean to an innocence lost , but it is also troublingly anti-intellectual , history filtered through robert fulghum . these will not be the concerns of the average movie-goer , i'm certain . they will be more interested in the pure entertainment value of forrest gump's picaresque journey through life , and the film's emotion . gump will be many things to many people . to me , it was just another good but flawed movie . 
screenplay : mike werb . director : charles russell . either you " get " jim carrey , or you don't . all right , maybe there's a little middle ground , but not much . carrey is turning into one of those performers who inspires as much head-shaking among his detractors as laughter among his fans . apparently my carrey threshhold is higher than that of most critics ; i enjoyed his ace ventura shtick while all about me were hurling brickbats . and once again , his manic gifts turn a wafer-thin story into a real guilty pleasure . as lively as the special effects are , the mask would be a loud dud without jim carrey's unique talents . if the underlying premise of the mask seems familiar--mild- mannered guy is affected by supernatural forces and finds his innermost desires released--it's because it was already done this summer in wolf , right down to the detail of how the same phenomenon has a different effect on people with different " true natures . " wolf handled the theme much better , but it was a more stylish film in many ways . the mask is full of cookie-cutter small-time hoods better suited for comic relief than for any real villainy , which makes stanley's predicament much less interesting . in fact , it's probably safe to say that nothing in the mask would be at all interesting without its inventive visuals and jim carrey's rubbery mug . fortunately , the mask does have those elements , and they make for a dizzying ride . the computer graphics which turn carrey into a walking tex avery cartoon are delightful , granting him a lunatic arsenal of tricks . the most whimsical use of ilm magic might be the mask's effect on another cast member , stanley's scene-stealing dog milo , in a hilarious bit from the final showdown . special kudos also should go to the makeup team headed by greg cannom , which has managed the challenging task of making carrey's mask distinctly otherworldly without obscuring his malleable features . with so much technical wizardry flying around , it might be easy to overlook the art direction and set decoration , from stanley's apartment to the coco bongo club , all of which are perfectly in tune with the comic book atmosphere of the mask . then there is 1994's boy wonder , jim carrey , who turns in a performance so energetic it should probably be regulated . he goes robin williams' aladdin genie one better , using his own face and body as often as any cinematic chicanery to become a gallery of characters . he is the single best reason to see the mask , and he truly must be seen to be believed . surprisingly , he actually gets supporting help , particularly from peter riegert , effectively deadpan as the no-nonsense cop . there are flat spots , like the sluggish performance of richard jeni as stanley's friend and co-worker , and the aforementioned yawn-inducing villains . the bottom line is this : if you can appreciate the idea of a group of police officers involuntarily joining the mask in a performance of " cuban pete , and if carrey doesn't make you cringe , the mask will fit you perfectly . 
screenplay/director : stephan elliott . you know the times are a-changing when drag queens are to be the subject of * two * movies in the space of one year . we're not talking about some like it hot or tootsie or mrs . doubtfire ; we're talking about genuine , larger-than-life , cattier-than-felix drag queens . you might not think it the most marketable of subjects , but production is underway on a studio project featuring wesley snipes , to wong foo , thanks for everything , julie newmar . while it's gentle and respectful of its characters , it's also a big , goofy musical filled with belly laughs . however , priscilla proves to be something less than a royal coach , and its many breakdowns serve as preludes to a series of culture-clash encounters between the off-beat threesome and the considerably more conservative townspeople they meet along the way . perhaps the wisest decision made by writer-director stephan elliott was not to spend too much time contriving an excuse for priscilla's passengers to go west . the three principles are marvelous characters spectacularly performed . guy pearce plays adam as completely carefree , a flamboyant youth who has had little experience with confronting ugly prejudice . bernadette , on the other hand , is much more experienced , and grows impatient with adam's giddy bitchiness . as bernadette , terence stamp delivers a knock-out performance , summoning a uniquely genuine femininity to accompany a light-hearted world-weariness . stamp is also a treat in priscilla's marvelously staged musical numbers . while mitzi and felicia perform with sass and energy , bernadette goes through the motions professionally but looking exactly like she " did this * years * ago . " costume supervisor emily seresin deserves special kudos for the wild outfits which highlight the film ; particularly noteworthy is an impromptu performance of " i will survive " for an audience of aboriginals ( accompanied by digeridoo ) , and the big show at the resort featuring numerous gaudy costume changes . there is one truly unfortunate element in priscilla , and it really leaves a bad taste in the mouth . her character , and accompanying performance launching ping-pong balls from a portion of her anatomy , are truly unworthy of this film . but if you're willing to grit your teeth through her appearance , priscilla will prove to be a mostly delightful piece of entertainment , suprisingly wise and touching . 
screenplay : warren beatty and robert towne . making an old-fashioned romance isn't as easy as it might look . while films from this year like it could happen to you and only you attempted to re-create the magic of bygone love stories , they succeeded primarily in creating cloying pseudo-parodies of what those classic stories were all about : that perfect someone appearing at the most improbable--and inconvenient--time . love affair does it right . warren beatty and annette bening have taken this third telling of a tear-jerking classic and made it a warm , sentimental and beautifully filmed experience , limited in its effectiveness only by beatty's somewhat wooden lead performance . if there is one unquestionable triumph to love affair , it is the atmosphere . there is a lyricism to his direction , without the force qualities of other recent romances . cinematographer conrad l . hall shoots in deep oranges and with lots of filters , and photographs bening in the loving style which used to be reserved for grace kelly or ingrid bergman . ennio morricone's sweet , simple score also contributes to a mood which inspires you to hold your date's hand a bit more tightly . this is not to say that love affair gets by on style points alone . at the top of the list is bening , beatty's real life better half , who shines as terry . few actresses in film can manage the kind of mature , intelligent appeal she brings to her roles , which makes it a shame that her appearances have been so infrequent of late . here she is both savvy and vulnerable , more than a match for beatty's aging playboy but still harboring basic insecurities . it's not a flashy role--love affair is not a flashy movie--but it's a fine performance . garry shandling is a delight as kip , mike gambril's agent , toning down his usual neurotic persona and giving a witty reading , and harold ramis has a funny cameo as an acerbic accountant . it's one of love affair's most significant failings that that same scene does more to explain beatty's character than beatty himself manages to do . this could have proved to be a fatal flaw , but there is just enough inherent romance in the situation that their pairing doesn't seem completely implausible . but the cathartic final scene is effective enough to make up for the melancholy tone of the final half hour . sentimentality is frequently a tough sell . love affair may be schmaltz , but it is artfully executed and well-acted schmaltz . and it renews my faith that somewhere , someone knows how to make a real love story . 
screenplay/director : kevin smith . for the past few years , filmmakers have been trying to capture what it is that defines the generation which has thus far been difficult even to name . so-called " generation x " films like singles ; bodies , rest & motion ; and reality bites have tried , but their target audience seems to have rejected those attempts . at first glance , clerks appears to be cut from the same cloth , a bargain basement variation on tales of cynical , over-qualified and under-achieving whiners . made for a paltry $36 , 000 by writer/director kevin smith , clerks frequently shows its low-budget roots in performances which can charitably be called amateurish . brian o'halloran has an easy-going and engaging presence , but he's often far too broad in his physical acting . only lisa spoonhauer as the sexy and sharp caitlin puts much real spark into her performance . smith's direction is simple , but his insistence on swinging his camera back and forth in two-character scenes also proves distracting . like go fish earlier this year , clerks is occasionally just a bit too clunky to be completely endearing . the episodes which make up clerks are of inconsistent quality , but the good ones are very good . the dialogue is filled with ultra-crude observations which almost earned clerks an nc-17 rating , but they're caustic and on-target . randal in particular , who acts both as the devil on dante's shoulder and as the real voice of reason in clerks , gets some marvelous lines , though virtually every one of them is unprintable . less effective are sequences involving a roller hockey game on the store's roof which simply lasts too long , and a montage of annoying customer types which is a bit is too cutesy . but clerks turns out to be more than just the sum of its parts . kevin smith places himself in the awkward position of chastising those who are most likely to be his audience , and it is that daring that makes clerks most worthy of admiration ; it is not often that personal responsibility is the moral to a story . while he may not have had all the tools at his disposal that a studio filmmaker would have had to tell this story , kevin smith did have a story to tell . clerks is unquestionably uneven , but it is also a very funny wake-up call to the over-the-counter culture . 
screenplay : john hughes and george seaton . director : les mayfield . let's leave aside for a moment the question of whether it was really * necessary * to make an updated version of the 1947 classic miracle on 34th street . it's the question that plagues every remake , often unfairly . while it may be rare to find a film done * better * the second time around , that doesn't necessarily mean that the remake might not be perfectly enjoyable on its own merits . and i believe that this is true in the case of this gentle fantasy . while it is nothing spectacular , it's genuinely touching , and feeds off a surprisingly strong current of spirituality . with the exception of some pratfall shenanigans at the parade early in the film , huges and director les mayfield avoid excess , keeping the story low-key and character based . the characters are not uniformly interesting , mind you . the love story between perkins and a too-good-to-be-true attorney ( dylan mcdermott ) is not well-developed , largely because perkins doesn't do too much with her role to show why such a perfect guy is interested in such a depressing woman . the villains are also pretty boring , and jane leeves ( daphne from tv's " frasier " ) in particular has nothing to do and even less to say as one of the rival store's operatives . however , it is the casting of actor/director richard attenborough as kriss kringle which helps the miracle happen . sure , he's no edmund gwenn , who won an academy award for his portrayal in the original , but attenborough is a warm and lively presence who is perfectly believable as an embodiment of human kindness without being * too * saintly . a scene in which he " speaks " to a deaf girl in sign language really put a lump in my throat , and there is a lot of genuine emotion in the film . doubtfire , who avoids overly-precocious traps while handling some tricky dialogue for a young actress . that conversation is part of a challenging theme in miracle on 34th street , and it brings us back to the question we started with : why remake this movie ? the answer can be found in the ways ( and occasionally none-too-subtle ones , it should be fairly noted ) that huges and mayfield use belief in santa claus as a metaphor for contemporary views on religious faith . the film asks whether the world is a better place for the erosion of faith , not because of some effect on " values , " but because of an effect on the human spirit ; it asks whether it is really a good thing to raise a child without faith . many viewers might not appreciate being confronted with these questions , but so few films ever dare to deal with the subject of faith that miracle on 34th street should be commended for trying . if it's not entirely successful , it's partly because robert prosky , as the judge presiding over the kriss kringle case , fumbles the speech which should emphasize this theme by making it far too animated when it should be pitched lower . the film's denouement is also somewhat too long , and doesn't maintain the spirit of the scenes with attenborough . but the important thing is that miracle on 34th street is a good family entertainment that takes a chance on being about something . and it made a believer out of me . 
a few years ago , i saw a production of " les miserables " in san francisco , and i loved it . i loved the experience of being in that theater , and of giving myself over to the spectacle and the energy of that live performance . some time later , it occurred to me that if i had seen the identical production on a movie screen , i probably would have laughed myself silly at its bombast . only this : live theater and film are not the same animal , and what works in one does not necessarily work in the other . vanya on 42nd street is a great stage production , but as a film it is simply good . the framing device , which shows the cast members and director andre gregory walking down bustling new york streets towards the theater , is clearly intended to establish a relevance of vanya in the modern day . to the extent that it succeeds , that connection is really about living a life in the theater . from the moment when the actors imperceptibly begin the production with the line , " your looks have faded , " this vanya becomes a kind of purgation of the agonies of being an actor , and the characters come to represent very recognizable types . the years of rehearsal and refinement show in performances which are effortless almost to a one . however , perhaps the most wrenching performance belongs to brooke smith , who tears into sonya with an emotional ferocity few actors could muster . her two scenes with moore are powerfully played , and when she broke down i felt tears welling in my eyes . it is as good a performance by a supporting actress as you'll see this year . all these things vanya on 42nd street does exceedingly well , but while i was sitting in my seat watching it on a screen , i often felt more distanced than i should have felt . louis malle's choices in framing shots are not particularly inspired , and cinematographer declan quinn's camera teeters for no apparent reason , creating that verite vertigo pioneered by woody allen's husbands and wives . to put it bluntly , i couldn't quite figure out why this film had been made . i started to become annoyed that i couldn't be one of the lucky few who was able to see this production in the flesh , and i wondered why these actors who were obviously so dedicated to this play hadn't considered touring with it . vanya on 42nd street is a superior interpretation of a fantastic play , but i couldn't quite shake the conviction that i really should have seen it * on * 42nd street . 
director : alan rudolph . the collection of authors , journalists and performers who gathered for lunches at new york's hotel algonquin in the 1920s are among those peculiarly american individuals who are perhaps more famous for being famous than for anything they actually said or did . there is a great historical disagreement as to who was there at any given time , to whom certain famous quotes should be attributed , and even whether those quotes were actually spoken . more than anything , they became symbolic of the kind of dissolute jazz age bon vivants immortalized by fitzgerald and hemingway . parker and the vicious circle , an uneven but still quite intriguing examination of the algonquin round table's most famous member . parker as it has ever been in rudolph's work . altman's trademark overlapping dialogue is particularly noteworthy , and it is one of rudolph's most questionable decisions . the round table was defined by the volleys of bon mots exchanged by its members , and while many clever lines come through , nearly as many are drowned out by other conversation . i often caught uproarious laughter in response to a joke i hadn't heard . rudolph uses the interactions of these individuals to demonstrate a superficiality which defined dorothy parker's world : everyone at the table was too busy trying to be clever to pay much attention to anything anyone else had to say . " i write doo-dads , " parker comments in one scene , " because it's a doo-dad kind of town , " and that remark speaks volumes about the round table regulars , and perhaps even the jazz age as a whole . as we watch parker slip deeper and deeper into depression , it becomes astonishing that none of her so-called friends , with the exception of benchley , ever seem to notice or care . leigh's performance is stunning , though she does affect a speech pattern that sounds like a gin-soaked variation on her stanwyck/hepburn bit from the hudsucker proxy , and she seemed to swallow many of her lines . it's a piece of work made all the more challenging by the odd structure of the script , which has leigh playing parker at several different phases of her life , as well as reading selections from parker's poetry directly to the camera . she manages to capture the soul of an extremely troubled survivor whose final line in the film ( " i can't believe i made it " ) is both comic and touching . her performance * is * mrs . parker , and through all of rudolph's fits and starts i found that i actually felt i had met dorothy parker . 
starring : whoopi goldberg , mary-louise parker , drew barrymore . screenplay : don roos . i have nothing against that ever-growing sub-genre of american filmmaking known as the " chick flick ; " however , i do have a problem with the idea that women will flock to any slapdash attempt at a sob story , any muddled mess which happens to include female friends , mothers and daughters and truckloads of tragedy . hollywood knows a lot about how to market films to women , but it has done a pretty miserable job of making them . fortunately , boys on the side is that rare creation , an emotional film that actually takes the time to develop characters , although it goes a bit overboard in its third act . the first half of boys on the side is surprisingly funny and effective , thanks largely to three winning performances by goldberg , parker and barrymore . goldberg has coasted quite a bit lately , playing the same hipper-than-thou character with a perpetual furrow in her brow as she deals with dopey white folks , but she is quite good here . parker is a more subtle actress , and she has to be in a role that easily could have become a fussy stereotype ; instead , robin is an extremely sympathetic and appealing character . boys on the side is very funny , but there is more to it than that . in one early scene , robin sprays disinfectant on jane's headphones before using them , and goldberg gives us a " you've got to be kidding " reaction shot . but that moment takes on a different resonance when it is revealed that robin has aids , and might be taking basic precautions . similarly , it is a surprise when jane refuses to hold robin's hand after learning of her illness , since we expect a nearly divine level of understanding from gay characters , but that moment is complicated by the realization that jane might be falling for robin , and that pulling away is just a way of expressing her fear of those emotions . there are numerous surprises like that , both funny and touching , throughout the first half of boys on the side , but the second half is much more uneven . once the women stop in tuscon , much of the film's energy stops with them , and humor inevitably gives way to bathos . most frustrating is a murder sub-plot , which is largely unnecessary and symptomatic of screenwriter don roos' tendency to pile far too much into far too little time . this is a film about the friendships between these three women , and it seriously falters when those friendships are not the focus of the story . when they are the focus , boys on the side does exactly what it sets out to do : it makes you laugh , it makes you sad , and it makes you care . 
quentin tarantino may prove to have a more profound effect on the immediate future of cinema than any other single individual . it's not just that other new filmmakers will be mimicking his style , though such recent fare as love and a . 45 shows that he is already having an influence in that respect . no , tarantino's most important legacy may be that films which until only recently would have seemed doomed to obscurity are finding enthusiastic distribution because the audience has spoken : dark , funny and twisted is * in * . the first beneficiary of the tarantino effect might be the british import shallow grave , a macabre little thriller with some shaky characterizations but a great look and feel . thrillers like shallow grave depend on tight plotting , tense situations and atmosphere , and it hits about two out of three . the point behind disposing of the body is somewhat lost on me , since they could have reported the death without reporting the money , and a few late developments are glossed over so quickly that it's easy for the audience to wonder exactly what happened when . but it is mostly in retrospect that these problems appear , because shallow grave is a pretty intense piece of work . a pair of interviews with a police detective are extremely effective , as you begin to watch the roommates' resolve crumble , and danny boyle's direction highlights a marvelous set , the massive flat shared by juliet , david and alex . the lighting , the bold colors and the seemingly endless hiding places create a mounting paranoia that sweeps you in even as it sweeps in the characters . yet for all its tension and eventual excursions into viscera , shallow grave is essentially a character piece that examines how the fragile relationships between these three individuals are shattered by their shared secret . unfortunately , the other two leads are not nearly as well developed . kerry fox is savvy and manipulative as juliet , but there is something missing , a bit too much left unsaid , particularly her refusal to deal with the men who call for her or approach her at social functions . while the story could have been about how their mutual participation in this event changes all three , it ends up that david is the only one whose state of mind is examined in any depth . still , shallow grave works fundamentally because it keeps the pressure on . it is always only a matter of time before a " perfect crime " is revealed in its imperfection , and the multiple double- crosses are fun to watch . though shallow grave could have been tighter and more psychological , eccleston's intense performance and a few nasty little twists make it a thriller that keeps you watching , guessing and squirming . 
screenplay : andrew davies . director : pat o'connor . maybe it's just a matter of perception , but movies seem to come out in thematic waves . 1994 was widely noted as the year of the simpleton , with both dramas ( nell , forrest gump ) and comedies ( airheads , dumb and dumber ) focusing on those with social or intellectual handicaps . though it occasionally loses sight of its strongest elements , circle of friends is mostly a warm , charming and insightful little romance , buoyed by a delightful performance from fresh face minnie driver . minnie driver is enchanting as benny , a shining if unconventional beauty with a sharp mind and a keen sense of herself . her growth is thoroughly convincing because she neither begins nor ends as an extreme ; hers is a slow but noticeable growth from girl into woman . chris o'donnell's irish accent slips here and there , but mostly his is a very relaxed and confident performance as a pretty boy lacking in confidence . the primary problem with circle of friends is that when the story isn't focusing on benny , it is more melodramatic and far less enjoyable . too much time is spent on nan's carefully planned attempts to land a rich husband , and the rather melodramatic plot developments which accompany those attempts work against the simple believability of benny's story . saffron burrows is also rather dull as the beautiful nan , and for as much time as we spend with her character , her motivations are never really clear . the conflict between the three friends' catholic morality and their earthly desires is much more interesting than the somewhat contrived external conflicts , and generally more amusing besides . 
screenplay : terry turner & bonnie turner . if there is a development in recent popular culture more depressing than the degeneration of " saturday night live " into a weekly televised car wreck , it is the proliferation of equally pungent big screen projects featuring current and alumni snl cast members . these films have primarily been wrong-headed attempts to turn a five minute sketch into a ninety-minute movie ( it's pat , coneheads ) or self-indulgent star vehicles for annoying stars ( opportunity knocks , billy madison ) . that is why it comes as such a complete shock that tommy boy is funny , and not just sporadically . it is an ideal vehicle for chris farley and david spade that falls flat only when it mistakenly tries to be warm and fuzzy . what separates tommy boy from other snl cast projects is that it looks like someone actually sat down and tried to figure out how chris farley and david spade could best be used . an hour and a half of nothing but farley's pratfalls and manic outbursts would have been intolerable ; ditto for spade's snottier-than-thou put-downs . indeed , both of their comic personae are very individual tastes , and those who are irritated by either or both of them might not find much to like in tommy boy . but for some reason , farley and spade complement each other very well : farley does something really stupid , and spade makes an acerbic comment . that's the basic formula , repeated with variations on the content and context . and most of the time , it's good for a solid laugh . that is largely because screenwriters terry and bonnie turner ( the brady bunch movie ) come up with some inspired situations within the routine plot . there are a few hilarious scenes of farley and spade bonding over cheesy songs on the radio , including the carpenters' " superstar " and the spanish language ballad " eres tu . " sure there are more than a few clunkers , as well as a completely unnecessary and un-funny scene centered around masturbation , but far more of the jokes are dead on . tommy boy's biggest lapses come when silly plot contrivances draw the focus away from the two stars . there is an obligatory romantic interest for farley in the woefully under-used julie warner as a spunky employee at callahan's , but it is about as tacked-on as a sub-plot could be . farley's villainous step-family is also pretty boring for the most part , although it is a kick to see bo derek again after over a decade , and rob lowe may have discovered a new career as a camp villain after this film and the first wayne's world . basically , any time the makers of tommy boy try too hard to be anything but funny , it doesn't work . when they try to be funny , it does . 
director : jon turtletaub . when--and for that matter , why--did sleepless in seattle become the sine qua non for any critical blurb for a romantic comedy ? " this year's sleepless in seattle ! " actually , the " why " part is easy ; sleepless in seattle was a huge box office success and an easy point of reference for an idealized modern romance . while you were sleeping is already drawing comparisons to the 1993 hit with some basis , but not because bill pullman is in the cast or the word " sleep " is in the title . both funnier and more genuinely romantic than sleepless , while you were sleeping seems destined to be for sandra bullock what sleepless was for meg ryan : the vehicle that stamps her as one of the few genuinely bankable female stars in hollywood . in many ways , the recent film of which while you were sleeping reminded me most was not sleepless in seattle , but groundhog day . it has a paper-thin , high-concept premise which at any moment could have collapsed under the weight of its contrivances . but it never quite happens ; just when you expect the script to go in a predictable direction , it doesn't . writers daniel g . sullivan and fredric lebow don't load the story with awkward little situations that lucy gets out of by sheer coincidence ( although naturally there are a few ) , nor do they resort to farce or slapstick . in one particularly engaging scene around a boisterous dinner table , while you were sleeping becomes more than its easily-summarized plot point . it also boasts a winning performance by sandra bullock and an impressive chemistry between bullock and bill pullman . with her wholesome beauty and radiant smile , bullock is perfectly cast as lucy . it is not a particularly complex character , but bullock has real grace as a comic performer , an under-appreciated skill evident in far too few current screen stars . he does not have conventional leading man looks , but there is an appealing self-deprecation in his manner which could make him a natural romantic lead . there are suggestions throughout the film that he's going to turn out to be a truly narcissistic jerk , but we never get a chance to see that character . peter gallagher ends up playing peter as mostly befuddled , and not very interesting . there is also a throwaway sub-plot involving peter's hell-on-wheels _real_ fiancee , who is not given a chance to do much of anything . the final twenty minutes of the film become mostly a waiting game until lucy and jack end up together , and one that drags on a bit too long . but it's what goes on while peter is sleeping--a bright , charming romance--that makes while you were sleeping a pleasant dream . 
starring : dylan mcdermott , nancy travis , james legros , jim belushi , quentin tarantino . screenplay : robert ramsey and matthew stone . director : jack baran . adventurous young screenwriters and filmmakers often have to walk a very fine line between originality and approachability . those seeking financing from sources like the sundance institute are trying to win people over with a creative spirit , but a different aesthetic is frequently required if the film is lucky enough to make it into the marketplace . destiny turns on the radio has already been branded with the financially toxic label of " cult film , " and it is true that its tone bears more than a passing resemblance to films like repo man and wild at heart . but there's more than that to destiny . although it is wild and quirky , occasionally to excess , it is also surprisingly entertaining and grounded in real emotion by an exceptional performance from nancy travis . it would be foolish to suggest that the first thing one would notice about destiny turns on the radio would be anything but it's rather off-center characteristics . a motel with rooms named after marilyn monroe films , a shared dream which results in a pregnancy and an electrified swimming pool which acts as a gateway to another reality are not exactly the stuff of your average multiplex picture . there are occasions when those elements come perilously close to overkill , or indeed topple into overkill , but they are rare . the main reason screenwriters robert ramsey and matthew stone and director jack baran succeed is that most of the strangeness comes from the characters , and they are well-developed and well-performed almost to a one . only quentin tarantino , who should be declared legally charisma-impaired , bombs in his role . that's a problem , because johnny destiny requires _presence_ , not just attitude . las vegas becomes a kind of character in the film , a real-life mirage of false hopes . it is an intriguing character , wonderfully played by an actress who has been stuck too often in minor roles in bad films like greedy . and it's a shame that too many viewers won't see her performance because of the strange story surrounding her . destiny turns on the radio is aimed at those with a taste for the surreal , but it also has a very real heart which makes it more than the sum of its parts . 
if you're looking for a textbook example of counter-programming , you would have to say that mgm's release of moll flanders qualifies . . . either that , or a textbook example of complete stupidity . june is supposed to be the exclusive domain of sequels , special effects and super-stars ; films based on period novels are not supposed to appear until the kids are back in school , the leaves have changed colors and the air is heady with oscar talk . nevertheless , here we have a romance with english accents taking on cruise , connery and carrey . it's a risky move , but one which could pay off , because moll flanders is a solid drama with a top-notch cast , and gives robin wright a break-out role to show off her talents . pen densham oversees a marvelous look for the production of moll flanders , and that look helps to make a fitful first half easier to take . the greatest charms in that first half are provided by freeman and corcoran , who share some frisky scenes as the no-nonsense manservant and his mischievous charge ; those scenes provide welcome comic relief . making your way through moll flanders can be like the experience of reading the novel in a high school english class -- the early exposition can lose you before you get to the meat of the story . i would hope that such is not the case , because moll flanders becomes an extremely effective and satisfying love story , and because even in that sluggish first hour robin wright turns in a wonderful performance . despite her delicate features , wright can make herself appear amazingly solid and determined , and that is a critical facet of the personality she is trying to convey . there is a completely natural chemistry between them , and their relationship makes the second half of moll flanders something special . densham's erratic sense of pacing does undercut the love story somewhat , as moll flanders never quite achieves the big , cathartic emotional moments one expects from a story of this kind . i think that he also doesn't allow freeman or stockard channing to do the best work of which they are capable . freeman may be the best american screen actor of the moment , but he never quite finds the character of the emotionally enslaved hibble , and channing similarly wavers between a kind of one-dimensional victorian villainy and a kinder , gentler side . what really makes moll flanders work , in a way that the recent jane eyre didn't , is that densham maintains a fundamental sense of optimism and energy , relegating the sense of loss and foreboding which could have dominated the story to a secondary status . moll flanders is a redemption story , and it is an effective one . it is also a human story , and that alone may help it to stand out while every theater around it reverberates with tornadoes and explosions . 
screenplay : david sheffield , barry w . blaustein , tom shadyac , steve oedekerk . director : tom shadyac . if you ask most movie stars whether a given project is a " comeback , " they would probably insist that they were never away . in the case of eddie murphy , that's actually pretty close to the truth . _you_ may not have seen harlem nights , or the distinguished gentleman , or boomerang , or even beverly hills cop iii , but someone did -- over $300 million worth of someones , in fact . so no , eddie murphy never went anywhere ; it was only his ability to make people laugh which took a long vacation . i was beginning to wonder whether there was any of the old spark left in murphy , and then along comes the nutty professor . he still might have trouble identifying a decent script , but his talent is in full flower , including an unexpectedly broad acting range . murphy plays sherman klump , a brilliant chemistry professor with a bit of a weight problem -- about 400 lbs . worth . the result is a startling transformation of sherman klump into buddy love , a lean , mean testosterone machine who is every bit the party animal sherman never was . the lion's share of the pleasures in the nutty professor are pure eddie murphy , but not necessarily eddie murphy the way you are accustomed to seeing him . there are some big laughs in those family dinner scenes , particularly an extraordinarily embarrassing dinner with carla in attendance , although the flatulence gags are piled on a bit thick . but murphy is not coasting on his street-wise motor-mouth persona here , the persona which often seemed to be the only reason for dud projects like the golden child or the distinguished gentleman to exist . if anything , the nutty professor is a chance to poke fun at that persona through the hyper-slick buddy love . buddy is the arrogant , self-absorbed misogynist everyone probably believes murphy really is , and he knows enough to tweak that image for all he's worth . the real surprise is watching murphy sink his teeth into a real character , and do some real acting . murphy brings out that side as something endearing , and makes his shy , self-effacing manner terrifically appealing . i never thought i would see the day when eddie murphy would play a character who inspired sympathy , but watching klump disintegrate before a barrage of the comedian's barbs is genuinely poignant . murphy is so good that it's too bad he doesn't have better material to work with , or a more supportive supporting cast . for the most part , the script is all set-up with few truly inspired comic situations , relying on absurdist dream sequences and special effects for the big gags . there are moments when buddy love is on screen that you are waiting for murphy to run to the extreme , and ace ventura director tom shadyac just seems to be waiting for him to do something wacky . the script doesn't really give him the best opportunities , though , and he is playing off undeserving foils in jada pinkett and an uncomfortably edgy larry miller . murphy is trying to show what he can do here , and he is given material like the overly obvious homily at the film's conclusion which doesn't show trust in his abilities to convey emotion without spelling it all out . those abilities turn out to be what makes the nutty professor so much fun . welcome back , eddie , even if you never went away . 
director : edward zwick . akira kurosawa's classic film rashomon may be the definitive cinematic text for film critics , because no film may work better at keeping us honest . the story of an assault seen through the eyes of four different individuals is about the subjectivity of reality , how perception creates " truth , " and every time i think about rashomon it makes me structure my arguments with care , and with an eye to my own subjectivity . i was thinking about rashomon quite a bit as i watched courage under fire , and not just because it is about conflicting accounts of a single event . throughout the film , i found my perspective shifting , my opinion rising and falling to the point where i realized that i was responding to courage under fire in pieces , and not as a whole . that response was at least in part the result of the kind of film courage under fire is , the kind of ambitious , sprawling drama which director edward zwick ( glory , legends of the fall ) has favored since his television days as co-creator of " thirtysomething . " reaction #1 : edward zwick is turning into a marvelous director of battle scenes . in glory , legends , and now in courage under fire , he captures the feel of war with a chaotic poetry , vistas of destruction which are nevertheless spectacular to behold . perhaps more impressive , zwick has accomplished something that the news was never able to accomplish , namely to drive home the fact that the gulf war was not a video game or a casual police activity like rousting a wino off a park bench with a baton . it was a war , and courage under fire does justice to the sacrifices of its participants . for a very long time , it is not clear what courage under fire is really about . is it a war-time tale of the terrors of the trenches ? is it a sort of mystery , where the real story of walden's actions will provide the payoff ? it takes forever for duncan to clarify what all of these stories have to do with one another , but by then they don't provide the layers of emotional resonance he was aiming for ; mainly , they provide confusion . there are too many conflicts in courage under fire , blunting the impact of the one which should have stirred the audience . reaction #3 : meg ryan really does have some dramatic chops . in previous serious efforts like when a man loves a woman and restoration , i found it difficult to buy ryan in a role which strayed from her quirky comic ingenues . washington is a tremendous actor , and he does some excellent work in courage under fire , but there are moments when the intelligence and confidence he almost always projects just don't seem appropriate . serling has moments of real despair and confusion , and washington doesn't always bring those qualities across . reaction #5 : courage under fire comes through with an emotional conclusion , and features some great supporting performances ( particularly matt damon as the medic in walden's crew ) . it is the kind of film which satisfies even as it leaves you suspecting that the scope should have been narrowed . courage under fire is a film which looks better from the back than the front , and a bit thick around the middle -- it's a different experience from different angles . 
starring : michael keaton , andie macdowell , richard masur , john delancie , eugene levy , harris yulin . screenplay : chris miller , mary hale , lowell ganz , babaloo mandel , harold ramis . director : harold ramis . there have been many instances where my positive reaction to a film has been as much a result of what it _wasn't_ as what it was , and groundhog day may be the perfect example . on paper , it was a high-concept premise with nowhere to go , an over-extended " twilight zone " episode with a laugh-track . there didn't appear to be any way to make an infinitely repeated day anything but infinitely repetitious , but director/co-writer harold ramis and co-writer danny rubin startled me with a comedy of improbable inventiveness and even more improbable resonance . multiplicity , ramis' latest project , arrives with many of the same warning signs , and again it stays fresher through its running time than you might expect . this time , however , the comedy is as instantly disposable as it is enjoyable . almost no time to enjoy any of them . but even two doug kinneys doesn't seem to be enough , and when doug #3 enters the picture , the opportunities for disaster multiply right along with him . in a way that groundhog day never was , multiplicity really is a gimmick film . multiplicity is always about the farce of several doug kinneys getting each other into trouble , and the fact that it works so well and so often shows how artfully ramis is able to execute that farce . the comedy gets rather broad with doug #4 , the " copy of a copy " who turns out to be " special , but the situations are great showcases for those characters , and keaton does some good work considering he is often working with no one but himself . multiplicity is a very funny film , full of clever touches like the character of a blissfully incompetent sub-contractor played by eugene levy and a housing development called " vista del nada " ( view of nothing ) , and it's easy to keep smiling through most of its 110 minutes . unfortunately , its attempts at a message get rather muddled . contributing screenwriters lowell ganz and babaloo mandel ( city slickers , forget paris ) have a tendency to paint emotional situations in extremely broad strokes , and that leads to some rather forced conflicts between doug and laura . andie macdowell , who was so good in groundhog day , doesn't have the chance to make an impression here ; her character is a necessity , not an individual . there are a number of rough edges in multiplicity ( including the excessively grainy special effects photography by richard edlund which allow the four dougs to interact ) , and they are mostly the result of an attempt to be the kind of film groundhog day was : a laugh-out-loud comedy which also managed to be about something warm and human . that kind of film is a rarity indeed , and it is no sin to have aspirations to that kind of completeness . in multiplicity , one laugh usually turns into another . 
screenplay : akiva goldsman . director : joel schumacher . those suggestions should be absurd , but the way warner bros . is pushing john grisham's anointed one , they're merely the next logical step . it's one thing to be the flavor of the month , but mcconaughey has become the flavor of next month , a star without a previous starring role . that's a rather unfair burden to place on an actor , but now that a time to kill is finally here , it looks like the talent is up to the hype . leading an exceptional cast , matthew mcconaughey helps create some riveting moments in an occasionally melodramatic story . white supremacists are the nazis of the 90s ; film makers love them because they know we love to hate them , and because they don't have to worry about anyone protesting if they are portrayed as hissable cartoons . there are plenty of complex issues involved in the story of a time to kill , foremost among them the criminal justice system's entrenched racial inequities , but director joel schumacher and his frequent screenwriting collaborator akiva goldsman can't resist the impulse to be crowd-pleasers , providing plenty of moments for audience members to applaud klansmen being beaten , spit upon , arrested or otherwise mocked , all underscored by elliot goldenthal's strident strings . it is too bad that a time to kill needed the sneering evil and repetitive cruelty of overt racists like sutherland's character , and even the poorly developed sub-plot involving the involvement of the naacp , because it is so much better at exploring its more three-dimensional characters . a time to kill is exceedingly well cast , and the performances sparkle . he is being compared to everyone from paul newman to marlon brando to kevin costner , but none of those comparisons really does justice to his unique appeal . there is an absolute ease to his acting which you almost never see in actors his age ( mcconaughey is a ripe old 26 ) , along with a screen presence you rarely see in actors of any age . and in a film which features a few too many loud and obvious scenes , mcconaughey is absolutely electrifying in a scene which is emotionally crippling in its quiet power : jake describing the rape of carl lee's daughter to the jury in graphic detail . it is almost possible to accept that spacey's savvy prosecutor doesn't object to the obviously inflammatory remarks . perhaps he , like us , was simply transfixed by witnessing the birth of a star . 
screenplay : nicole holofcener . director : nicole holofcener . walking and talking is the kind of film men generally see only if dragged by their wives or girlfriends . they react much the same way a male character in walking and talking does when he refers to the acoustic guitar tunes preferred by his fiancee as " vagina music ; " by that definition , this would certainly be a " vagina film . " with recent flops like now and then and moonlight and valentino giving films about female friendships a rather bad name , it might be easy to dismiss walking and talking sight unseen . but for what it's worth , writer/director nicole holofcener puts a woody allen spin on the genre , making her debut feature a quirky neurotic comedy in which appealing performances help counteract a lack of substance . walking and talking seems to have two major themes working at the same time . on the one hand , it is about the romantic relationship of our two heroines , and it provides some clever and amusing insights . holofcener makes her characters sexual beings without having it be part of the joke that a woman is a sexual being , the way it happens in many films written by men , and there is an impressive ease to the way in which she portrays men and women who are comfortable with each other . one such scene finds laura and frank beginning a casual shoving match in an elevator which turns into a playful war , and it is typical of the economy with which holofcener establishes the dynamics of her characters' relationships . there are plenty of signifiers which show us how significant this friendship is -- an opening scene of laura and amelia as pre-teens reading " the joy of sex , " the illness of the cat they shared when they were roommates -- but the signifiers don't take the place of effective scenes between them . it is true that the problem between the two is that they don't spend much time together any more , but we don't get enough opportunities to see their friendship at its best so that we can feel a sense of loss over their friendship at its worst . walking and talking is not exactly meaty fare in either of its two main themes , but what sells the film is its frisky tone and a cast which downplays the angst . catherine keener ( who was the insecure ingenue in living in oblivion ) is a delight as amelia , and keeps her borderline obsessiveness from becoming either pathetic or disturbing . it's a funny and sad performance as a woman having difficulty differentiating between needing and needy . keener has an ability to connect with other actors , to really seem to be listening , and that makes for some priceless interactions . anne heche is a weaker link in a weaker role ; her laura's predicaments never seem as urgent to her or to us . nicole holofcener's script might be a bit talky , but the talk is sharp and the talkers even sharper . forget labels like " chick film . " 
screenplay : edward tang , fibe ma , lee wai yee . imagine a country where few people had ever seen an arnold schwarzenegger film ( it's hypothetical , work with me here ) . imagine that eraser was the first of his films to get a wide release there , and that it became a moderate success . supercop has the same high-flying action as rumble , a much stronger story , a bit less of a sense of absurd fun , and presents the distraction of terrible dubbing . supercop is actually the third film in the popular police story series , but that is almost as relevant to the story as it was when steven seagal did under siege 2 . jackie chan , for the most part , is about a persona , not a character . his goofy grins and self-deprecating manner make him a uniquely likeable action hero , and his ability to get out of impossible situations often seems as much a product of resourcefulness as sheer physical ability . chan's sense of humor is such an asset that it is unfortunate supercop doesn't integrate it into the story very smoothly . in many ways , supercop is a straightforward formula action film of the kind we tend to see a lot of in america , with evil drug lords , can-you-top-this stunts and a minimum of distracting characterization . rumble in the bronx may have been silly , but it was silly start to finish , and chan's fight sequences were part of the humor . supercop feels more divided , half jackie chan the action hero and half jackie chan the clown . to give supercop its due , there are some significant ways in which it is more than a typical american action film , and nowhere is that more evident than in the presence of michelle khan ( michelle yeoh to her hong kong fans ) . capable female action stars are a non-entity in hollywood , but khan packs a wallop both literally and in her screen presence . she also gets two of supercop's best stunts -- a leap onto a moving truck , and a motorcycle jump onto a train -- providing just some of the thrilling action moments typical of chan's films . it is also a lean and mean 85 minutes ; american action directors could take a lesson in efficient editing . action has always translated well on an international level , which makes it all the more annoying when making a film like supercop acceptable to american viewers requires dubbing which seems to have been recorded in a tin outhouse ( although a theme song by devo is almost as baffling ) . if miramax is serious about making chan's films an american staple , they should consider investing in some decent sound mixing . solid efforts like supercop will continue to build jackie chan's audience ; now it's time to bring on the big guns . 
screenplay : robert altman , frank barhydt . director : robert altman . for the most part , however , those were risks in subject matter . in kansas city , altman structures his narrative like an improvisational jazz solo , with a payoff in the final ten minutes that is a real kicker . the question is whether he will have lost his audience in the 100 minutes of riffes which precede it . the product of those elements is a fusion of music , mood and plot in which the latter often gets short shrift . altman has one of his typically large casts to keep track of , and his shifts back and forth between them seem to have little to do with pacing . those speeches are far from riveting -- once you get the point that he is " seldom seen and often heard , " seldom's sociological observations simply serve to stall kansas city . for a long time , it seems to be just another example of the kind of film i criticized manny & lo for being , a hostage drama in which captor and captive predictably become friends . then , just as i was prepared to give kansas city up for dead , it assaulted me with developments so unexpected that they left me breathless . suddenly , a performance by jennifer jason leigh which had seemed like just another one of her mannered stabs at imitating 1930s screen actresses made beautiful , terrible sense ; suddenly , miranda richardson's opium-addled society dame was even funnier and more tragic ; suddenly , the johnny who had been little more than a piece of furniture during seldom's speeches came to life . kansas city's tale of brutal truths beneath glossy surfaces is the polar opposite of most of this summer's fare : it is a film which works far better when you are thinking about it afterwards than it does while you are watching it . i only hope audiences are willing to trust altman the risk-taker as long as it takes . 
there is nothing that will make a hollywood marketing executive salivate like a current news story to which a new film can be linked , and if you remember the bounce the china syndrome got from the three mile island accident of 1979 , you'll understand why . when a seven-state power failure hit the american west on august 10th , the folks at gramercy must have done the mipos dance of joy -- five days later , i had press material for the blackout thriller the trigger effect mentioning the august 10th failure . it's hard to resist that kind of " torn-from-today's-headlines " marketing , but i hope they don't make the trigger effect look like a cheap knock-off by overdoing it , because it is nothing of the kind . this is a sharp and surprisingly effective thriller which makes up for a sluggish middle with an exceptional start and finish . it is a smart and subtle piece of film-making which underlines the main premise of the trigger effect : how fragile a foundation it is on which civilization is based . it is amazing how much more obvious the ineptitude of the island of dr . moreau becomes when compared to a film which takes a very similar theme -- what separates us from animals -- and does it so much better . he tries to connect those troubles to the film's central themes -- annie has a problem respecting the mild-mannered matt until he steals medicine for the baby -- and he is successful for a little while . whatever point koepp might have been trying to make about the attraction of " animal behavior " gets muddled in the house-bound middle third of the trigger effect . koepp is not a genius at creating shaded characters ( remember , he _did_ write jurassic park and mission : impossible ) , but he demonstrates an impressive talent for building tension and for pacing a thriller to keep his audience involved . it is also noteworthy that koepp never makes a point of explaining what caused the blackout , because that would have been sending the wrong message about what mattered about this story . the trigger effect is a disturbing and all-too-real tale which makes the ironic observation that we have come to depend on technology for our humanity , and if a little creative marketing will bring people out to see it , then so be it . 
" the dialogue . " " the dialogue . " " what about the dialogue ? " " nothing , i'm just talking . " " i know you're talking , but what the * * * * are you saying ? " just this : because it is so easy to get caught up in david mamet's distinctive brand of rat-a-tat , profanity-laden dialogue , it is even easier not to notice that he may be one of america's most deeply humanist playwrights . oleanna , for all its incendiary subject matter , had its foundations in a frustration over societal impediments to communication ; glengarry glen ross showed the business world hammering people into the ground . the twenty year old american buffalo was one of mamet's first plays , and it retains the ferocity of youth in its film incarnation , a set-bound but affecting study of trust and the lack thereof . it is a challenge to make a play work on the screen , particularly if the play is as dialogue-heavy as a david mamet play , and director michael corrente ( federal hill ) seems content to follow the lead of film versions of oleanna and glengarry glen ross by refusing to " open up " the action . american buffalo takes place almost entirely in one location -- don's store -- and there are times when the production begins to feel very cramped and oppressive . it is a bleak tale filmed in bleak tones , but corrente retains a necessary urgency . he also has two sensational lead actors and one up-and-comer to play the key roles , and they make american buffalo even more compelling . hoffman brings to the role the dissolute swagger of ratso rizzo , and while that makes the characterization familiar , it doesn't make it any less intriguing . there is a slight weak link in sean nelson , who made an electrifying debut in 1994's fresh but appears to have grown more self-conscious ; he clearly never quite gets a handle on mamet-speak . still , when the three actors share the climactic final scene , they refuse to surrender your attention . mamet is very much an acquired taste , and the taste of buffalo will be unappetizing to many . as a film , american buffalo is not spectacular , but it brings a great play to a wider audience , and that alone makes it noteworthy . those who might find it too pessimistic should think of it instead as a plea for a society where we can trust again , as mamet's raging attack on a world where civilization hangs by a thread and where friendship isn't worth a nickel . 
screenplay : allison anders . director : allison anders . running time : 115 minutes . i have this idea that what happened to grace of my heart -- a good movie which flirts with being a great one -- is that allison anders wrote herself into a corner . grace of my heart has a superb character study at its core , made even more appealing by the top-notch work of illeana douglas , and that makes it a disappointment that allison anders has surrounded that character with so many elements which draw attention away from her . on one level , grace of my heart operates simply as a travelogue through an era in american popular music , and there are some extremely entertaining moments integrated into that travelogue . yet there are moments when the setting and the inspired-by characters feel forced . anders draws too much attention to supporting players by asking you to chuckle at what she is able to suggest about gore , phil spector and others without actually saying so , and it becomes a tail which wags the dog . dillon's performance is too sleepy to be involving even as jay becomes more and more paranoid and depressed , and we are left to watch him play the way wilson might have been without understanding why we should care . it is a long , patience-testing episode , and it is particularly frustrating coming at the tail end of a string of relationship episodes in which denise falls hard for a guy who turns out to be more trouble than he is worth . still , i was generally willing to indulge anders , because i could see where it all was leading . illeana douglas is fantastic as a woman who is both strong and weak , and her unique looks somehow make her even more believable as someone forced to linger in the background longer than her talent warrants . i wanted to stick with her through her story , and it remained worth the effort even after anders gets sidetracked . grace of my heart is a film with built-in flaws , but they can be overlooked for a chance to watch a woman find the grace in her own heart . 
whenever i hear an actor talk about needing to " stretch , " i generally feel the need to stretch my legs very far in the opposite direction . i do not mean to suggest that actors are not artists who seek out new challenges . it is simply that those who usually make the biggest noise about moving beyond one type of role in which they have been successful are also those who have lingered in that one role for a very good reason . hugh grant had become so familiar as a stammering , self-effacing light comedian that one would be forgiven for suspecting that was all he had in him . as evidence to the contrary , witness extreme measures , a solid hollywood thriller in which grant takes to the role of suspense hero like a producer to a sequel . as a rule , the hollywood suspense thrillers of recent years have been a rather sorry lot , and i believe that one of the reasons has been that constant attempts to shock are being substituted for the creation of mounting tension . director michael apted has made some of the more intriguing character-based suspense yarns of recent years ( thunderheart , blink ) , and extreme measures has a way of getting under your skin . it is an exceptionally well-paced film , with guy's dilemma growing incrementally ; its effect is based on watching guy get deeper and deeper in trouble , rather than watching him hurtle from one life-threatening confrontation to the next . there is also at least one completely unexpected turn which seems to put guy in an impossible situation , and a fight in an elevator which might truly bring you to the edge of your seat . grant is exceptionally convincing as an er surgeon , approaching every crisis with a matter-of-fact professionalism and confidence . it is tempting to play such characters as arrogant , and in the case of extreme measures it would be even more tempting so that the story could be based around a lesson about playing god . but guy is simply a scientist whose basic curiosity gets him into a completely unexpected mess , and there is such a consistency to grant's performance that his comic and dramatic moments merge seamlessly . it is an eye-opening piece of acting , and all the more challenging because grant has to carry nearly every scene . if there is one major frustration in extreme measures , it is that apted and screenwriter tony gilroy don't handle the conspiracy at its center very well . it is obvious what is going on far too early , particularly if you have seen any of the trailers which essentially give everything away . that detracts from the process of discovery , and might make you impatient as you simply wait for guy to figure out what you have known for over an hour . the conclusion tries to shove far too much into far too little time -- a physical showdown ; the outlining of a moral dilemma ; the attempt to flesh out hackman's role , which is really a glorified cameo -- resulting in a thriller which sags exactly when it should be peaking . it is fortunate that the preceding ninety minutes is so energetic and involving . it is even more fortunate that hugh grant is so well-suited to his role , and that it proves not to be such a stretch to think of him in a lab coat rather than just a morning coat . 
tom hanks is a nice guy , the guy everyone in hollywood likes , so you figure that he didn't get his first gig as a writer/director by demanding it . not that he would need to -- getting on the good side of one of the most bankable good guys in movies is a pretty smart business move , so someone was going to give him a shot . it could only be a fringe benefit for fox if hanks' debut effort turned out to be a good film or a successful one , and it is entirely possible that they may have gotten both . that thing you do ! is a nice movie , and one which a lot of people are going to like , even if it falls apart at its conclusion . that thing you do ! naturally , success proves to be more complicated than the wonders expect . there are plenty of places hanks could have chosen to take the conflict in that thing you do ! -- guy's father resisting his son's music career , the deposed drummer growing bitter over missing the boat -- but by the time we reach a scene in which both dad and drummer are gleefully enjoying the wonders' success it has become clear that hanks is not interested in that kind of melodrama . that thing you do ! is intended almost entirely as a playful romp , and for quite a while it succeeds . that thing you do ! does a fine job of capturing the exhilaration of newborn celebrity , nowhere better than in a wonderfully crafted sequence where the band members hear their song on the radio for the first time . with so many films about real-life rock and roll stars focused on the destructive nature of fame , it is a welcome change of pace to find one which makes fame seem like so much fun . there is at least an attempt to foreshadow jimmy's ambivalence over the band's success , but he is such a bland character compared to his bandmates that he barely even registers as relevant . though it had been little more than wallpaper for most of the film , it suddenly becomes the defining crisis , and you are likely to wonder if you missed something when faye goes into a tearful denunciation of jimmy's inattentiveness . hanks doesn't seem to know how he wants to end the story , except that he wants it to end happily , and the effortless good humor of that thing you do ! the strange thing is that even though hanks bungles the big moments , he does so many things right with the small moments that it is easy to walk away with a smile , beginning with a great title song which actually seems to deserve to be a hit . scenes at a rock and roll show ( with kevin pollak as a catch phrase-prone disc jockey/promoter ) and a tv variety show capture the glorious phoniness of early 60s show-biz , and hanks evokes help ! -era hanks himself does solid work in the role of the all-business white , proving he's still a much better actor than he is a director , and a considerably better director than he is a writer . that thing you do ! is clumsy but lovable , the work of a nice guy who is far from finishing last as a film-maker , even if he has a way to go before finishing first . 
it's tough to find a fresh angle when you're making a movie about 20-somethings and their relationships in 1996 , since the last five years have seen such a glut of such films that you couldn't throw a rock without hitting one . young film-makers may be attempting to follow the creative writing 101 dictum of " write what you know , " but in so doing they are writing what we all have seen enough of by now to know even better than they do . swingers appears at first glance to be more of the same , but it's not really a relationship film . instead , screenwriter jon favreau has created what amounts to a comedy with a national geographic twist , a charming , almost documentary account of the habits of the north american human male in the wild . director doug liman seems to be working hard to create a sense of place ; in fact , he sometimes seems to be working a bit too hard . the authenticity liman is going for with those locations is an authenticity specific to the time and place where swingers is set , and that is fine , but it is much more winning in its authentic portrayal of the way men act when they are out in groups and on the prowl . the dynamics of a group of male friends is presented with a hilariously spot-on realism , with trent as alpha male directing the behavior of guys who are little like him , and in fact may not not _like_ him . that is another aspect of male friendships which is rarely represented on screen but which is nailed in favreau's script : men often find themselves hanging out with guys with whom they share virtually nothing in common . swingers gets its' characters relationships so right that it is almost frightening . it is rather disappointing that so much time is spent on mike mooning over his ex , given the stronger kick of the male-bonding scenes . the sad fact is that , like in real life , spending a lot of time with someone who does little but whine about his lost love gets to be a bit of a drag . mike's extremely tentative steps toward getting back on the horse are the frame on which the events in swingers hang , which makes it kind of a necessary evil . the comedy is much richer when favreau , liman and the cast of swingers take you on safari , observing a mating dance that is both strange and wonderfully familiar . 
unfortunately , that controversy is almost more compelling than the film itself , which proves that hero worship and drama can make uncomfortable companions . though violent and destructive , the program eventually brings the british to the bargaining table , but the result could be even more violent and destructive . " i hate them for making hate necessary " collins says in one of several scenes where jordan makes his soul-searching known to us , and it is only because liam neeson can sell such a line that it doesn't inspire eye-rolling . neeson has exactly the charisma and physical presence to be convincing as a nigh-mythical figure known as " the big fella , " but he also conveys a moral uncertainty . he plays collins with intelligence , conviction and sadness , and it is more thanks to neeson than it is to jordan that collins emerges as an intriguing character , a man of action forced to make an uneasy transition to man of peace . michael collins is usually a solid piece of drama when it focuses on the political , with alan rickman providing a complex counterpart to collins as the more politically calculating de valera . even though michael collins manages to avoid ever using two of the most critical words in the irish conflict -- " catholic " and " protestant " -- it still provides a strong overview of the pivotal years when the irish rebels realized that fighting dirty was the only option left to them . it is a good looking film with several fine performances ( including neil jordan regular stephen rea as an informant for collins inside the british government ) , but i don't think it ever pretends to be an objective history . michael collins is meant to be a monument to an important figure in irish lore , and it does a fine job of making him a monument . 
paws . claws . gaping maws . pick your favorite ( or least obnoxious ) analogy-inspiring epithet , because no matter how stridently the makers of the ghost and the darkness insist that it is " based on a true story , " it owes at least as much to jaws as it does to real life . all right , so there isn't a matt hooper to be found , but don't try to tell me this comparison is a reach , especially when there is a scene in which patterson and remington attempt to attract their prey by laying down what amounts to a chum line around a building where they are lying in wait . ordinarily , it is be a remarkably bad idea for a film in any genre to make such obvious references to the classics of its genre , because they only serve to emphasize that you are not watching a much better movie of the same kind . yet there is something fairly satisfying about the ghost and the darkness , because it is a kind of suspense film you just don't see very often . a force of nature in its own element can be a truly frightening thing ; give that force of nature a vaguely unnatural personality , and you've got the ingredients for one scary piece of work . screenwriter william goldman knows what works in this kind of film , and when the lions are on the prowl in the ghost and the darkness , it is surprisingly gripping . director stephen hopkins ( blown away ) directs his action scenes with efficiency and a sense of barely-controlled chaos , and he is able to make the lions' every appearance a time to scoot to the edge of your seat . he may be no spielberg , but that's even true of spielberg sometimes . the reason the ghost and the darkness never approaches jaws in overall quality is what happens between the attacks . the performances are almost uniformly under-stated , with val kilmer doing solid work as the confident patterson , and john kani and brian mccardie are appealing as two of patterson's colleagues on the bridge project . that is even more true of douglas' remington than it is of the other characters -- he is a hunter with a tortured past whose one moment of introspection is supposed to define his entire personality . douglas is an actor given to playing characters broadly , and even though he is relatively restrained he still appears to be camping it up compared to his co-stars . you never care nearly as much about the individual humans in the ghost and the darkness as you should , because you don't really know who they are . still , at least there _are_ characters in the ghost and the darkness , and at least their confrontations with their adversaries get your adrenaline pumping . there is a tremendous primal appeal to the battle between man and beast , and with cinematographer vilmos zsigmond providing glorious photography and jerry goldsmith turning in one of his most effective recent scores , the ghost and the darkness turns it into solid , suspenseful film-making . perhaps there is less inherent claustrophobic tension when you take the men out of a boat and put them on dry land , but the ghost and the darkness makes sure you understand who has the home field advantage here . you may feel as though you have seen some of this before , but you haven't seen it in a long time , and you might realize that you have been missing it . farewell and adieu to you fair spanish ladies . . . 
director of photography : clive tickner . producers : stephen evans , david parfitt . mpaa rating : pg ( adult themes ) running time : 125 minutes . there is a sub-category of shakespeare's comedies referred to by scholars as the " problem plays , " and thought twelfth night is not technically one of them , it is rather problematic in its own right . trevor nunn's adaptation of the play retains that sub-plot , which makes the film quite faithful . it is easy to turn twelfth night into a rather trivial farce , if an entertaining one , but nunn has opted for a surprisingly sensitive rendering of the tale . imogen stubbs is an appealing viola whose unrequited love is a source of both pain and frustration , and her defense of the depth of a woman's love is given a confident strength . perhaps most unconventional is nunn's choice of making the reunion between viola and sebastian the emotional climax of the film rather than the joining of any pair of lovers , yet it works thanks to a carefully established prologue and the restrained work of stubbs . helena bonham carter is simply wonderful as olivia -- smart , sexy , seductive and _very_ funny -- leaving a somewhat stiff toby stephens as the only squeaky wheel in an otherwise smooth , clockwork romantic comedy . hawthorne is an actor with a remarkable range , which results in the curious case of him pitching portions of his performance in a way which makes malvolio too sympathetic . a scene in which the fool feste ( a wry , philosophical ben kingsley ) impersonates a cleric to further taunt the imprisoned malvolio should be simply amusing , but hawthorne seems so genuinely confused and tormented that his comeuppance seems dreadfully unfair . it is an unusual instance where a less accomplished actor , who might have played the role quite broadly , might also have maintained a lighter tone . twelfth night may be uneven , but is still largely appealing , thanks to the talented cast and the unique design of the film . the locations in cornwall allow for some marvelous , liberating exteriors , and the late 18th century settings and costumes allow nunn to balance twelfth night on the border between period piece and contemporary romance . kingsley and smith make particularly inspired choices for their roles , lending humor both subtle and expansive , and richard e . grant is a perfect dim-witted fop as sir andrew aguecheek . trevor nunn's direction is unexpectedly restrained in small moments between viola and orsino given nunn's recent history staging massive stage productions like cats and les miserables , but his over 25 years as director of the royal shakespeare company have not been forgotten so easily . twelfth night is a problematic play , but nunn has served it well , making it a revel with a dark side that can't eclipse the bright . 
mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , sexual situations ) running time : 101 minutes . my fellow americans is a buddy comedy . it is a bickering buddy comedy . it is a bickering-buddies-on-the-road comedy . in short , my fellow americans has about as generic a basic premise as there is in hollywood . so how does it end up so improbably entertaining ? because when it comes to film-making , story isn't even half the story -- execution is king . my fellow americans uses the familiar plot as a starting point , adds a script with just enough lively turns , and casts two consummate professionals in the lead roles . the result is a simple but engaging studio comedy , energized by the wonderful pairing of jack lemmon and james garner . you're going to see a lot of critics referring to my fellow americans as grumpy old presidents , and it's not just because jack lemmon is on board that comparisons to the grumpy old . . . films are appropriate . the most notable similarity is that my fellow americans also bases much of its humor on the notion that senior citizens spewing forth profanities are intrinsically hilarious ; no fewer than nineteen separate expletives season the dialogue of lemmon and garner . it is an unfortunate decision , if for no other reason than that it is unnecessary . political rivals should have more personalized gibes at their disposal , and indeed the script features a few nice zingers aimed at the stereotypes of each party . it would have been nice to see more -- and more pointed -- barbs , particularly like those aimed at haney's dim-witted vice-president ( john heard ) , whose mispronunciation of a single word may provide the film's biggest laugh . insult humor only goes as far as the slingers of the insults , though , and my fellow americans rises well above its material simply because lemmon and garner bring out the best in each other . lemmon's kramer is the more complete character , a politician who so desperately needs approval that he has become an over-eager joke . while kramer is the guy you can be sure promised everything to everybody , garner's douglas is the charismatic charmer who probably didn't have to . garner has long been one of the best actors around at playing the put-upon grouch , and it is a delight simply to see him in a leading role on the big screen again . the two are both perfectly matched and perfectly mis-matched ; there is something about their veteran interaction which makes the most mundane situations sing with comic confidence . there isn't much segal can do with the sentimental angle in the script , as the ex-presidents' encounter with an average american family leads them to ask the " duh " -inspiring question of whether politicians may be out of touch with their constituents . all these problems my fellow americans has , yet i laughed harder than i had any reason to expect . handed the sow's ear of a standard buddy-caper script , jack lemmon and james garner were able to turn it into a purse . . . perhaps not silk , but surprisingly smooth nonetheless . 
i'm sure there are people out there who view beavis and butt-head do american as yet another sign that the end-times are upon us ; they are probably the same folks who have condemned from day one the mtv series on which it is based as a celebration of violence , stupidity and lack of respect . speaking as an admittedly defensive some-time fan of the show , i think " beavis and butt-head " is much smarter and more self-aware than its detractors give it credit for being . mike judge created a series for mtv which takes aim at the generation of youth mtv helped create : kids without the attention span to sit through an entire music video . do young viewers of the show sometimes delight in the anarchy and low humor without appreciating the sub-text ? probably , but the same statement is true of " the simpsons , " and no one would accuse " the simpsons " of not being smart . there's no point in pretending that beavis and butt-head do america doesn't traffic in plenty of below-the-belt gags -- and above-the-belt , where women are concerned -- because that is the level of beavis and butt-head's sense of humor . sex , masturbation , gas and other toilet functions all send the twosome into paroxysms of their trademark immature snickering , yet judge stages many of these moments with a knowing wit . that is not to say that a little beavis and butt-head doesn't go a long way . even fans of the series might find 80 minutes of their antics getting repetitive , particularly when connected to a standard " mistaken identity " premise in which morons take such bizarre actions that they are assumed to be brilliant . the series also benefits from the commentary on music videos which breaks up each episode's plot , and that commentary is missed in beavis and butt-head do america . its absence removes the rare opportunities you have to witness how selective their obliviousness can be as they analyze the cliches of videos . judge tosses in some clever bits unrelated to the series , including a great opening credits sequence scored to a " shaft " -like isaac hayes tune and voice cameos by cloris leachman and a fellow credited as " earl hofer " ( david letterman's nom-de-cinema in cabin boy ) , but most of the gags are directed squarely at fans of the show . the uninitiated might find themselves baffled at the applause which goes up for cornholio , beavis' caffeine- and sugar-fueled alter-ego . a keen grasp of reality prevents me from attempting anything like a conversion of " beavis and butt-head " haters . hard-core opponents consider them not just annoying but actively evil , an animated pair of potty-mouthed pauly shores sucking the collective will to think out of the heads of america's impressionable youth . but beavis and butt-head do america , crude though it may be , is more genuinely inventive than space jam and 101 dalmatians combined , and less insulting to the intelligence of younger viewers . all it takes is a very funny moment which underscores the futility of butt-head trying to piece together a rather elementary crime scene to point out that dumb characters don't have to mean a dumb movie . beavis and butt-head do america overcomes its fundamental dopiness to provide entertainment for those prepared to laugh with its self-absorbed protagonists _and_ those prepared to laugh at them . 
producers : robert a . miller , david v . picker . director : nicholas hytner . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( brief nudity , adult themes ) running time : 125 minutes . to demonstrate my empathy with the themes of the crucible , i'm going to engage in a bit of heresy of my own : i don't think arthur miller's play is particularly good . i'm not suggesting that it is dated , as other critics have done . the ideas in the crucible were never the issue , but those weighty issues overwhelmed under-developed characters . productions of the crucible have lived or died on the ability of the actors to invest the material with feeling missing from the page , and this first english-language film of the play is no different . fortunately , the cast is very strong , and the conventions of cinema give the energy level a much-needed boost . flawed as it may be , the crucible still has moments of undeniable power . miller's 1953 play is well-known as an allegory for the " red scare " and black-listing of the 1950s , but miller's own screen adaptation attempts to make the story less specific to that era , while also making it more visual . the scenes are not meant simply for shock value , but to emphasize the active hypocrisy of the accusers . winona ryder does some of her best work ever in the role , shedding the restrained quality of her previous period film performances . here she lets loose like an animal -- desperate , haunted and dangerous . ryder is one part of a cast which gives its all to the crucible , beginning with paul scofield as danforth . scofield brings a commanding , weathered presence to the role of salem's grand inquisitor , and a conviction that the judge's work is good and proper . he also gives lines a punch few other actors could muster ; when he announces that he intends to " touch the bottom of this swamp " of accusations and counter-accusations , he utters the word " swamp " with a fearsome authority . joan allen's steady , cool elizabeth is just what the part calls for , and she shows that passive-aggression is not a uniquely 20th century phenomenon . surprisingly , the weak link in the cast is daniel day-lewis . proctor is an under-written role , but there is too much self-righteous heroism in day-lewis's reading . under-written characters and under-developed relationships are the main faults of the crucible as a text ; at times , it feels nearly as plot-driven as a michael crichton novel . the story is meant to provoke the audience to outrage at the lives destroyed by false accusers and complicit authority figures , but it only takes a couple of scenes to make the point rather than the repetitive structure of the children's accusations . still , there are a couple of scenes in the crucible which can get any audience to hold its breath , notably a tense questioning of elizabeth for which there can be no correct answer . director nicholas hytner ( the madness of king george ) offers an interpretation which isn't in the least iconoclastic , but he knows where to use george fenton's score or a lingering close-up to give a scene added weight . the crucible is a good ( though not great ) adaptation of a good ( though not great ) play which still has the ability to cast its own spell . 
screenplay : kevin williamson . director : wes craven . mpaa rating : r ( violence , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 105 minutes . in the late 70s and early 80s , theater screens were overrun by a film genre which had primarily teenage audiences filling the seats and sociologists shaking their heads . it was the golden age -- if that isn't a gross misapplication of the term -- of the slasher movie , where cutlery-wielding crazies turned every possible day on the calendar ( halloween , friday the 13th , prom night , mother's day , my bloody valentine ) into a stomach-churning ordeal . these films usually differed only in the manner of the violent killings , leading to a numbing predictability deserving only of parody . wes craven's scream wants to have some fun with the conventions of the slasher movie , but not at the expense of providing a few scares of its own . that presents problems as well as opportunities , as the self-aware script sometimes diffuses the tension craven can create as a director . in scream , the students at woodsboro high are facing more profound problems than the usual homework and bad skin . as scream begins , it looks like it is going to be a fairly conventional horror film , if an unusually gripping one . most of the familiar tropes of the slasher movie are in place -- the absentee parents , the improbably massive house with plenty of glass , the ever-alarming ringing phone -- but the sequence is still scary stuff , with barrymore providing an effective and convincing portrait of mounting panic . though much of scream becomes a joke at the expense of monotonously violent horror films , craven is not about to spit in the face of the genre which made his career . horror films in general are not the target in scream -- horror films with no style or imagination are , and craven provides both throughout the film , though nowhere as effectively as the opening . what happens between the scares is what gives scream its knowing edge . kevin williamson's script is loaded with references to horror films -- it seems that half a dozen are aimed at craven alone -- and loaded with characters who have seen other horror films . many of those references are spelled out quite literally , and they are the least interesting . some of the most subversive humor is the least obvious , however . scream plays with expectations effectively , making the guessing game part of the in-joke . the guessing ends in a climax which , while certainly surprising , isn't particularly effective . it is also excessively drawn out , as writer and director seem to engage in an ideological battle over whether it is going to be the climax to a horror film or a commentary on the climaxes of horror films . in the end it is both , which is to say that it is neither . some of the gags are quite funny , but the suspense all but vanishes in the final fifteen minutes as the characters talk their way through a comparison of this finale to the traditional finale . the script for scream is not clever enough to provide a consistently witty thriller ; it is sometimes witty and sometimes thrilling , but never both . that alone makes scream stand out from its genre cousins , though , as wes craven reminds us that terror can be fun , and not simply a grueling march through gore-spattered holidays . 
director : jerry zaks . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( some strong profanity , mature themes ) . running time : 97 minutes . please ignore the next couple of sentences if you are a stickler about having no part of a plot spoiled for you : in marvin's room , nobody dies . illness plays a significant role in the story , and many viewers have come to resent maudlin disease-of-the-week melodramas in which everything seems to function as an extended prologue to a tear-jerking deathbed scene . there is something terribly dehumanizing about making an illness the central character in a narrative , so it is a relief to discover that marvin's room is actually about people . though occasionally stage-bound and over-plotted , marvin's room finds superb actors lending a surprisingly restrained touch to a genre crying out for a little restraint . fortunately , marvin's room isn't _about_ aids any more than it is _about_ any disease . it is about estrangement and reconciliation and family ties , and it covers this treacherous ground with as much comedy as sadness . stage veteran jerry zaks does fine work with his rookie screen effort , and the gifted cinematographer piotr sobocinski ( krzysztof kieslowski's red ) gives marvin's room a warm , comforting glow . the overall effect of the film is an unusual one for films of its kind : it draws you in without pouncing on you with over-wrought emotions . the superb cast certainly deserves much of the credit for that success . and of course there is meryl streep , an actress so talented it has become a sort of cinematic sport to mock her versatility . here she plays lee with an anger which drives her every action ( though she does indulge in that well-work actor's crutch of acting with her cigarette on occasion ) , and she is convincing both in her early resistance to any overtures of good will and in her slow realization that she cares more about her sister than she realized . there is a particular grace to her honest portrayal of someone terribly uncomfortable with being around illness . there are certainly times when marvin's room feels hemmed in by its stage roots , and conversations build to an over-dramatized pitch . mcpherson's script also over plays its comic relief card , particularly in the person of dan hedaya as a lithium-medicated receptionist who seems more appropriate to an episode of " murphy brown . " dicaprio's character also feels out of place occasionally , as though every time the story turned back to him it was in danger of losing its way . but the important factor in marvin's room is that these people don't get together for the express purpose of watching one of them die . living is more interesting -- and more complicated -- than dying , and mcpherson created a work which recognizes that fact . you don't have to have a funeral to touch real emotions . 
screenplay : woody allen . director : woody allen . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 95 minutes . woody allen is one of the unlikeliest film-makers i can think of to try to revive the movie musical . it is true that allen has made nostalgia something of his personal fiefdom , and that he clearly loves the old standards , but that doesn't necessarily make him the best man for the job . to oversimplify the matter somewhat , the near-total disappearance of the musical as a cinematic genre has been the product of a less innocent era ; for a musical to work its magic on you , you had to surrender to its often-absurd optimism , something increasingly difficult to do in a cynical time . woody allen may not necessarily be a cynic , but he has become somewhat synonymous with sophistication . everyone says i love you is an entertaining trifle which never truly transports you because allen is too often outside the genre . this may be the first meta-musical . everyone says i love you deals with the complicated romantic entanglements of an upscale extended family . everyone says i love you is an experiment , to be sure , with most of the actors singing their own parts and production numbers popping up in the oddest places . a couple of the numbers work superbly , notably a ghostly dance to " enjoy yourself ( it's later than you think ) " which is reminiscent of disneyland's haunted mansion , but watching this film makes you realize how long it may have been since you've seen characters break into song on screen ; even though you know it is a musical , it is a bit startling every time a song begins . the problem with everyone says i love you isn't the songs , it is allen's approach to them . his audience is notoriously upscale , and he makes his films decidedly with that audience in mind ; how better to explain the knowing laughter which accompanies a cameo appearance by itzhak perlman playing violin at a party ? in fact , knowing laughter plays a significant role in everyone says i love you . allen appears to be banking not on the songs and dances themselves being entertaining , but on their silly incongruity being entertaining . one moment , a light-hearted duet between goldie hawn and woody allen on the banks of the seine , strikes a perfect low-key tone , but it is a rare exception . allen has made a comedy in which the object of much of the humor is the fact that people are singing and dancing ; he is getting us to laugh _at_ the musical genre , not with it . one of the ironies of that effect is that allen may also have given a winking acknowledgment to critics of his romanticized view of new york . there is plenty to laugh at in everyone says i love you , from skylar's propensity for swallowing engagement rings to one hilarious swipe at italians from a teutonic housekeeper , as well as inspired performances by edward norton ( effortlessly charming in his two musical numbers ) and tim roth ( hilarious as a suspicious criminal thrust into high society ) . curiously , those two performances also emphasize why everyone says i love you isn't better . they offer a couple of rare moments of unrestrained glee in a story which feels constrained by its characters' social positions , even though allen is all too conscious of the world in which he has set his story . it is noteworthy that the marx brothers play a significant role in the film's climax ( as well as the title , a tune prominently featured in horse feathers ) , because everyone says i love you is a musical in the sense that the marx brothers' early films were musicals , where songs serving romantic sub-plots only got in the way of the real funny material . it is also set in the posh world the marxes used to tear to shreds , only the classy folks are the heroes this time . everyone says i love you sings , but it might have soared if the guiding sensibility had been groucho instead of margaret dumont . 
screenplay : steve james and eugene corr . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity ) running time : 103 minutes . as the opening scenes of prefontaine unfold , you could be excused for worrying about its prospects as a drama . those scenes include a lot of documentary-style footage of track races , as well as " talking head " shots of the actors playing steve prefontaine's friends and family , complete with captions identifying the characters . well , anyone concerned about james' ability as a story-teller didn't see hoop dreams . though he may have a few things to learn about directing actors and writing dialogue , james crafts prefontaine into a compelling character study which takes surprising turns for a sports film . one of the things which makes prefontaine more satisfying than the average underdog-makes-good bio-pic is that the style gives it a unique rhythm . james has cinematographer peter gilbert employ a hand-held camera for many sequences , creating a kind of urgent energy which matches prefontaine's personality . the script does an efficient job of establishing how his lack of success as an under-sized youth baseball and football player drove him to find a place where his refusal to surrender would be enough , as well as the arrogant sense of personal invincibility which often made him reckless . jared leto ( heartthrob jordan catalano from " my so-called life " ) gives a naturalistic performance encouraged by the documentary style , but his intensity isn't always as convincing as it could be . he has the golden boy charisma down pat , without all the ferocity . he is convincing enough , however , to make the arc of his character intriguing . then prefontaine makes the unexpected choice not to be about whether or not pre wins his race , but about how he responds to a disappointing result . james' use of documentary clips from the olympics does slow the film down somewhat , but it also establishes the 1972 olympics as a kind of turning point in the perception of " amateur " athletics . most sports movies are about the main character ( s ) winning , and a few are about the main character ( s ) just doing their best . i can't think of many other sports movies which were about a character who learns to define himself apart from his sport . there are plenty of places steve james betrays his inexperience with fiction film-making , notably with some flat characters like pre's girlfriend nancy ( amy locane ) and the tough-but-caring coach played with enthusiasm by r . lee ermey , as well as a pace which makes prefontaine feel long at only 105 minutes . yet there are two scenes in which james shows the kind of handle he has on his material . the first is the olympic 5 , 000 meter race , directed with a pulse-quickening energy ; you know someone is doing an exceptional job of film-making if you know the result of the race and you are still sitting on the edge of your seat . the second is more subtle , but perhaps more important to the impact of prefontaine's story . prefontaine died in the crash at the age of 24 , and the success of prefontaine as a film comes from the fact that we appreciate this tragedy not as the loss of a fine athlete , but as the loss of someone who was becoming a fine human being . a subtle distinction , perhaps , but one which separates mediocre directors from good ones . steve james knows his film-making , whether the subject is fact or fiction . 
call 911 for the cliche police if you must , but the eyes are the window to the soul . the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze : paul newman , ralph fiennes , anthony hopkins , morgan freeman . you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds , that the characters they play are real human beings . we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor , but he had that unique quality in his eyes . in gridlock'd , an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire , shakur and his co-star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry . they soon make a new year's resolution to get into rehab , but that proves to be easier said than done . the world in gridlock'd is just as frustrating as the world in falling down , but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time . hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system , but perhaps not enough of them . a significant chunk of gridlock'd is devoted to spoon and stretch's flight from d-reper and from the police , and those sub-plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments . the entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running , while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time . hall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film's main events , perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self-destructive behavior . oh , the irony of it . tupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case , and living the life to back it up . mostly it comes through those eyes , eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta . with friends like that , spoon doesn't need enemies , and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much . the tragedy now is that we won't get more chances to see those eyes again . 
screenplay : scott silver . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , adult themes , profanity , violence ) running time : 100 minutes . there are moments in the course of performing this job that i wish i had the director in front of me so i could just shake him . it isn't the terrible films which get me so worked up , because there is no amount of sense i could shake into directors in those cases . rather , it is the near miss which frustrates me most , when i see a potentially fine film disappearing into a fog of pretension . apparently the subject of street hustling is particularly conducive to sending directors into fits of artistic incontinence . there is an affecting human drama in there , if you can wade through the symbolism to find it . there is , however , something pleasantly unfamiliar about the authenticity of johns' setting . the unique dynamics of these characters' lives should have been enough to sustain johns , but silver isn't satisfied with telling his story in a straightforward manner . there are plenty of moments when silver doesn't seem aware that , sometimes , less is more . it is a particular shame when distractions interfere with a performance as uniquely compelling as david arquette's . we know he is doomed from the moment he reveals that " nothing bad ever happened to me while i was wearing my lucky sneaks , " but arquette refuses to make him a lost soul/victim of society . john has no sense of a future , so he takes any action assuming that he won't have to deal with the consequences , and he uses people with a similar disregard . this dream leads to a surprisingly touching moment involving the hotel's desk clerk ( richard kind ) , one of several sparkling scenes silver gives to his supporting characters ; another clever bit finds jimmy the warlock becoming a bit less menacing as he struggles with basic subtraction . silver had great actors working with great characters , so it is disappointing that johns is only a good film instead of a great one . with time , i hope scott silver learns what a great chef understands : presentation should complement a fine meal , not overwhelm it . you don't serve up a filet mignon just to smother it with parsley . 
screenplay : leslie bohem . director : roger donaldson . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , intense situations ) running time : 105 minutes . i have been anticipating the arrival of dante's peak , the first of 1997's two volcano films , with a combination of dread and . . . well , still more dread . the return of the disaster film has been about as welcome a pop culture phenomenon as 70s nostalgia , both of them reincarnating uncalculated vapidity as calculated vapidity . it only takes one twister to turn you off the genre ; throw in independence day and daylight and any critic could be excused for walking into dante's peak with an attitude . but if i have to sit through more disaster films , i only hope they can be as thrilling as dante's peak . though just as plot- and character-impaired as its genre cousins , dante's peak delivers a solid hour of relentless tension and excitement . dante's peak is a strange kind of success , because it includes many of the noteworthy flaws of twister , and then some . we get the same obligatory romantic pair thrown into danger with a minimalist back-story tagged on , along with a team of quirky scientists to provide comic relief . brosnan is ruddy and somber for most of the film's running time , hamilton is frazzled and likeable , and both of them trudge dutifully through fifty minutes of exposition as though any unnecessary acting might tire them out before the big finish . leslie bohem ( the scripter of record on daylight , apparently a specialist in films which end with traumatized people wrapped in heavy blankets ) also adds a dose of jaws , but doesn't give us the pleasure of an actual villain . charles hallahan provides the political voice who ends up causing more damage , and there is a teasing sub-plot about a potentially skittish business developer . neither one offers enough conflict , however , forcing the audience to sit and wait out the plodding first half for the big show . and what a show it turns out to be . the surprising thing about the post-eruption second half of dante's peak isn't necessarily that it is effective , but that the reason for its effectiveness doesn't exist entirely on a hard drive somewhere . there are certainly a few impressive visual effects sequences , including a cloud packing the concussive force of a small nuclear weapon , but director roger donaldson gets just as much mileage out of the time-honored technique of jiggling the camera to represent an earthquake . no , dante's peak is an effective thriller because the characters repeatedly find themselves in new and apparently impossible situations , and the direction gives those sequences an edge-of-the-seat tension . from a dizzying truck ride through town destined for the universal studios tour , to the crossing of a flood-threatened bridge , to a mine shaft which threatens to turn brosnan into a sardine , dante's peak provides the kind of relentless , well-crafted action which is what movie-goers should be talking about when they talk about certain films being like roller-coasters . the biggest surprise of all may be that the man behind that action is donaldson , who has served up cinematic backwash like species , the getaway and cocktail . it is an eerie moment , and donaldson manages to get you itching for the fate of the characters even though they haven't been given any personalities . more impressive still , he does it without assaulting your senses . there is , however , something rare in a film which can generate the kind of tension dante's peak generates . maybe it is possible to present a disaster without being one . 
it has been too long since we have seen gena rowlands on screen , but it takes only a few minutes of unhook the stars to recall how good she can be . we know instantly , of course , that this isn't true . mothers tend to get very shabby treatment in the movies , portrayed as perpetual nags or otherwise treated as comic relief , but rowlands' performance as mildred is beautifully balanced and convincing . if unhook the stars had focused entirely on mildred , it might have been a great film . in a film which is otherwise low-key and observant , tomei starts to crank up the adorable loud-mouth routine to my cousin vinny levels . a scene in which monica is a guest for thanksgiving dinner -- much to the consternation of mildred's straight-laced son ethan ( david sherrill ) -- plays like something from a much broader fish-out-of-water comedy , and drags on for an awfully long time . tomei's performance isn't a bad one ; it's just a good one in a different kind of movie . her character exists mostly to provide the laughs , and whether or not monica and her estranged husband reconcile is only interesting because it affects mildred . cassavetes makes the mistake of treating that issue as one in which we have an equal emotional investment . big tommy's passes are rather absurd , and not simply because mildred is a much older woman . that romance ultimately has little to do with mildred's development through unhook the stars , but cassavetes doesn't quite seem to realize what a great character he has in mildred , and what a unique arc her story takes without the distractions of a wacky neighbor or a romantic interest . that is more of a testimony to how good unhook the stars is when rowlands is center stage than it is to a lack of quality the rest of the time . you only wish you could have watched without the supporting characters jumping up and obscuring your view quite so often . 
screenplay : christopher guest and eugene levy . director : christopher guest . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 83 minutes . the reason inspired satire is so rare nowadays is that people have been given a warped perception of what satire is . the popular culture -- fed by " saturday night live , " david letterman and even political pundits -- has created the notion that irony , sarcasm and satire are interchangeable , and that there is something inherently hip about ridicule as a spectator sport . but it takes no imagination to savage someone or something you despise ; the best satire in any medium has been born of affection , from people with a gift for pointing out the negative while recognizing the positive . this is spinal tap , the best comedy of the 1980s , was a brilliant satire of the excesses of rock and roll which also respected the commitment of the artists to their work . waiting for guffman , a comedy from tap alum christopher guest , is a more uneven effort , but it is at its funniest skewering small-town america in all its cockeyed optimism . publicity for waiting for guffman is emphasizing the spinal tap connection by describing guest as " the lead guitarist of spinal tap , " but i don't think that comparison does guffman any favors . yes , it is similarly filmed in a faux documentary style , and derives a similar off-beat energy from its largely improvised script . however , there are fewer outrageous high points , largely the result of a less inherently outrageous milieu . the more you expect a middle-american spinal tap , the more time you might spend waiting for the inevitable disasters in the play which turn out to be not so inevitable after all . it may take sitting through all of " red , white and blaine " before it becomes clear that waiting for guffman is not going to be a parade of incompetence , though guest ( who co-wrote the story with co-star levy ) does have fun with the cloistered perspectives of his characters . guest has taken some heat for his swishy portrayal , but i think such criticism misses the point . everyone watching the film understands that corky is supposed to be gay , but no one _in_ the film understands it . gay men simply are not part of their world , so no one thinks twice about why they have never seen corky's " wife " bonnie , or about his exaggerated mannerisms being anything but " theatrical . " the real subject of waiting for guffman , however , isn't merely how narrow the world-view of blaine's residents may be , but how the residents involved in the production respond to a whiff of big city show-biz . you may spend much of waiting for guffman waiting for " red , white and blaine " to be terrible , but it isn't terrible . it is simply ridiculous , of course , that a show like this could ever go to broadway , but the performers are too wonderfully naive to recognize that fact . waiting for guffman is occasionally sluggish through its middle half hour , and hardly the non-stop riot spinal tap was ; it also treats its characters with far more good-humored respect than you might expect . guest understands that it is possible to laugh at people and still love them , and that fine satire can be achieved with the poke of a finger as well as a sledgehammer . 
screenplay : david aaron cohen & vincent patrick & kevin jarre . producers : lawrence gordon and robert f . colesberry . director : alan j . pakula . you can bet that sony pictures executives have spent plenty of time in the last few weeks hoping that there is , in fact , no such thing as bad press . then , in a newsweek interview , brad pitt took a few shots at the mid-stream script changes on his upcoming film the devil's own , inspiring the kind of spin control usually seen only on the teacup ride at disneyland . pitt's comments were surprising in an era when stars are generally obliged to swoon over their latest project , but it may be even more surprising to see the end product of the process which frustrated him so . the devil's own is an uncommonly thoughtful suspense film with a razor-sharp performance by pitt , proving that pitt's standards may be considerably higher than anyone else's in hollywood . if anything , it is the missed opportunities for even more detailed characterizations which end up disappointing . the bonding between them is casual and un-dramatic -- a game of pool here , a snippet of conversation there -- and director alan j . pakula trusts the actors to establish a connection without resorting to trite dialogue or inappropriate outbursts of emotion . we like them , too , and for quite a while both of them are the heroes of the devil's own . . . until pitt plays the anti-hero to ford's more conventional square-jawed hero , and it is hard to choose sides between them . in a film with such an unconventional struggle at its center , it is all the more jarring when conventional formula elements rear their ugly heads . obligatory psycho-villain treat williams gets to ooze malevolence and serve up severed heads ; obligatory romantic interest natascha mcelhone gets to be gorgeous and supportive of frankie . those occurrences are relatively rare , however , because the devil's own doesn't move the way you expect suspense thrillers to move . the action sequences are infrequent but emphatic , with a premium placed on the patient establishment of character . in that scene , tom suggests that he never wanted to be a cop , a sub-text which appears out of nowhere and might have given more depth to the character throughout the film . there are certainly instances where the devil's own feels like the product of a script-by-committee , but the star power of ford and pitt in an intriguing relationship guides it over its rough points . i could only hope to be subjected to more " troubled productions " like this . 
only a year later , smith made a studio-financed follow-up called mallrats , a film so widely reviled that smith publicly apologized for it , announcing " i don't know what i was thinking . " though he sometimes explores his themes with more earnestness than clarity , smith gives chasing amy both a wicked sense of humor and a genuine sensitivity about the complications of sexual politics . for the first half-hour of chasing amy , kevin smith concentrates on churning out the laughs with his often-crude , usually pop-culture-heavy dialogue . he shows an admirable willingness to take on potentially thorny topics like gay stereotypes -- there's a great sequence involving a gay black comic book writer ( dwight ewell ) who is forced to keep up a public image as a militant afro-centrist -- and a conversation about archie and jughead as gay lovers works despite its forced tarantino-as-a-slacker quality . smith even pulls off a riff on jaws in which banky and alyssa compare wounds from oral sex horror stories like an emotionally immature richard dreyfuss and a lesbian robert shaw ( though the flashback literalization of those stories is ill-advised ) . while the jokes are rarely profound , they are usually effective and delivered with zing by the actors . it doesn't help that two of the longer speeches are delivered by joey lauren adams , a talented actress but one whose jennifer tilly voice becomes grating when emotional scenes force her to wail for several minutes at a time . smith clearly wants to stretch himself beyond satiric comedy , but he never quite finds a pace which gives the more serious moments in chasing amy a spark to match their sincerity . it's a shame smith's romantic observations never quite click as drama , because his ideas are far more intriguing than most of what is served up in contemporary romantic comedies . there is an impressive lack of judgmental posturing in the way smith develops his characters , and he shows keen insight into how different people respond to societal norms about sexual behavior . it's simply clear that smith is still a guy who writes like people sitting around talking , and that style works much better with comedy than with drama . when it is at its funniest , chasing amy reminds you why everyone was so high on kevin smith in the wake of clerks . and even when it falters as a drama , it proves that smith isn't content with making clerks over and over . or , perhaps more important , that he won't make mallrats over and over . 
director : lynne stopkewich . mpaa rating : unrated ( sexual situations , nudity , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 78 minutes . canada's david cronenberg has already delivered one exploration of the bond between carnality and mortality in 1997 , the much-talked-about crash , and now countrywoman lynne stopkewich has presented us with kissed . her narration is surprisingly effective at explaining the reasons for and the impact of sandra's actions , and molly parker plays sandra as a decent , focused young woman who understands how her necrophilia is viewed by others . stopkewich gives matt an enigmatic history -- he's a medical student who is taking time off for an unexplained reason -- and outerbridge gives a painful conviction to his growing frustration with his inability to satisfy sandra . sandra has come to terms with her unique needs , and it is to stopkewich's credit that sandra is portrayed as someone with compassion rather than as a twisted fiend . the arc of the story may be fairly predictable , but that story is skillfully constructed to make the fate of the characters matter . there is an unexpected warmth to kissed . being canadian doesn't mean you have to turn sex -- even sex with a corpse -- into something cold and emotionless . 
screenplay : jim mcglynn . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 100 minutes . most films about con artists treat the big con as the only reason the story exists ; once it's clear who's been had and who's done the having , it's time to strike the set and call it a wrap . not so for traveller , a frisky and well-crafted drama which takes the time to develop its characters and its atmosphere . bokky becomes pat's mentor in the family business , creating plenty of entertaining opportunities for the audience to watch the development of their cons . screenwriter jim mcglynn wisely avoids turning those scenes into the foundation of traveller , instead allowing them to act as comic flavoring for a nicely observed character study . the actors make traveller consistently interesting to watch while mcglynn and director jack green ( the gifted cinematographer of unforgiven and the bridges of madison county , making his directing debut ) slowly explore their relationships . and there are plenty of relationships to explore . these tangents push the film's most unique element -- the culture of the travellers -- into the background ; the production notes provide more sense of who the travellers are than the film itself . as the climax of the film turns into a violent hostage drama , traveller begins to feel rather generic , as though its unique spirit has been compromised for manufactured conflict . still , there is plenty to like about traveller , from its casually confident pacing to its evocative soundtrack of blues and country classics . thanks to rich characterizations and a strong cast , this is one story of con men in which the " men " are more important than the " con . " 
i have come up with a definition -- admittedly arbitrary -- for " tv-movie " as it tends to be used in a derogatory fashion . melodrama certainly plays a part in that definition , but it is more symptom than disease . the real problem with tv-movies is that they tend to be about issues , not about people . melodrama results from a story about a situation ; drama results from a story about people responding to a situation . hollow reed has been garnering some comparisons to tv-movies which are only half fair . the story concerns that tv-movie standby the custody battle , with a few provocative twists . hollow reed really covers two issues , then : domestic violence , and attitudes about homosexuality both institutional and personal . on the first front , cries of " tv-movie " amount to utter nonsense . director angela pope has crafted a splendid domestic drama which includes many wrenching scenes of people coping with personal turmoil . sam bould's performance as oliver is the centerpiece of that story , a quiet and reflective piece of work which allows the audience to feel his fear , confusion and isolation . as long as hollow reed is focused on the dynamics of hannah , frank and oliver , it is truly exceptional . there is , however , another issue with which to grapple , and the grappling is frequently clumsy . martin donovan , the laconic protagonist of hal hartley's trust , simple men and flirt , here plays another laconic protagonist . in hartley's films , donovan's mannered delivery works with the surreal situations ; in hollow reed , donovan is like a mugging victim who mutters " stop , thief . " pope tries to make up for that lack of spark by providing a big court-room scene where hollow reed begins to feel exactly like a tv-movie . the testimony is treated like a therapy session where the characters' deep dark feelings are exposed , turning the climax into a lecture . like the least effective tv-movies , hollow reed starts to feel like it is exists to arouse your indignation rather than to involve you emotionally . if hollow reed is ultimately worthwhile viewing , it is because there is much more right with the domestic violence story-line than there is wrong with the gay rights story-line . still , the way pope and writer paula milne approach each issue shows that a timely topic does not a tv-movie make . it's only the latter that you'd probably see on fox starring one of the cast members of " melrose place . " 
screenplay : robert gordon . director : griffin dunne . mpaa rating : r ( adult themes , sexual situations , profanity ) running time : 101 minutes . begin with the fact that addicted to love is about two people stalking their respective ex-lovers , and you'll see that it isn't exactly your conventional romantic comedy . that's a strong statement when you consider that " conventional " and " romantic comedy " are virtually synonymous where major studios are concerned . perhaps more than any other genre , the romantic comedy thrives on predictability , in much the same way that romance novels thrive on predictability . addicted to love is a film which takes risks within that genre , which makes it a rarity . the fact that so many of those risks pay off makes it particularly intriguing . perhaps the most impressive thing about addicted to love is how it makes its tricky premise work . screenwriter robert gordon could have gone for all-out farce in which the motivations of the characters mattered less than their wacky actions ; he could have made linda and anton so one-dimensionally villainous that they seemed to deserve whatever they got . sam is a man whose obsession is less pathological than scientific -- he keeps watching linda because her behavior just doesn't make sense based on his rational observations . even anton is a complicated creation , with tcheky karyo giving a surprisingly engaging performance as a man who is more self-absorbed than malicious . addicted to love draws comedy and emotion from understanding of the people involved . it was also a risk pairing broderick and ryan , since both have made careers out of characters notable largely for their geniality . broderick doesn't stray far from that persona , though he is still very appealing as a decent guy doing some indecent things . it is ryan who stretches the most , perhaps even farther than she stretched in the straight drama of courage under fire . this is no sally albright she is playing -- there isn't a shred of romantic wistfulness left in maggie . her comic lines are savage and bitter , allowing ryan to display a darker comedic edge which previous roles hadn't given her a chance to show . her performance gives the romance unexpected depth , lending poignancy to scenes like a romantic interlude with broderick in which each participant is thinking about the one he or she _really_ loves . none of this would matter much , of course , if addicted to love weren't also funny . there are plenty of quirky laughs in gordon's script , from a sweet scene between ryan and broderick providing dialogue for a conversation between anton and linda to a stampede of cockroaches through a restaurant . griffin dunne's direction provides the one jarring flaw in addicted to love , creating an awkward rhythm in those comic moments of maggie and sam's plan against anton which isn't always in synch with the character development . the broad physical humor is sometimes out of place in a story which does such a good job of creating characters struggling to heal emotionally . then again , that is just one more way in which addicted to love doesn't take you exactly where you might expect to go . in case it really matters , addicted to love is a conventional enough romantic comedy that it provides a suitably happy ending . beyond that , let it surprise you . 
directors : ron clements & john musker . mpaa rating : g . running time : 90 minutes . over the past few years , while most studio event films were growing bigger , louder and dumber , the folks at disney were doing something terribly underhanded with their animated features . like cereal makers injecting twelve essential vitamins and minerals into our frosted sugar bombs , they were slipping competent story-telling into our entertainment . in films like pocahontas , toy story and the hunchback of notre dame , the mouse gave our unsuspecting children reason to expect thematic depth , complex villains and appealing heroes even while they were being amused and dazzled . it's all terribly insidious , this raising of expectations , and not just for audiences . expectations in the disney boardroom were raised by the $530 million in domestic grosses racked up by aladdin and the lion king , making the mere $140 million for pocahontas and $100 million for hunchback look like chump change . perhaps , uncle walt's successors may have concluded , audiences would rather eat a salad when they want their twelve essential vitamins and minerals . all this being prologue to the observation that hercules , a frisky and energetic offering from directors john musker and ron clements ( who helped revive the moribund disney animation empire with the frisky and energetic the little mermaid and aladdin ) , is merely a pleasant way to spend a saturday afternoon . no trouble so far . . . in fact , there's quite a bit to recommend hercules . british cartoonist gerald scarfe , who acted as production designer , gives hercules a distinct look full of sharp angles and stylized characterizations which separates it from other recent disney efforts . there are a couple of very catchy tunes by disney stalwart alan menken and new lyricist david zippel , including a wonderful brill building-style love song called " i won't say . " musker and clements also trot out the kind of pop culture references which worked so well in aladdin , including quotes of the karate kid , midnight cowboy and the seven year itch as well as some deft satire of over-saturated merchandising . if hercules had come up with a heart to match its art , it might have been deserving of that " masterpiece " label disney affixes indiscriminately to its animated features . it starts out with promise , presenting the adolescent hercules ( voiced by joshua keaton and perfectly rendered as a gawky jumble of massive hands and feet ) as the quintessential teen-age outsider . it's not exactly a redemption story , not exactly a quest story , and not exactly a love story . it is , quite simply , a cartoon . the fact that there's anything remotely dismissive about that term shows how far disney has raised the bar on animated film-making . even hercules , which comes up short in defining its hero , delivers complex supporting characters like meg ( a superb vocal performance by susan egan ) with real emotions . after recent disney triumphs , however , we know that more is possible . children will probably be more delighted by hercules than by the darker hunchback , and adults will probably enjoy james woods' oily wheeler-dealer manner as hades ( we all knew that the devil was really an agent ) . hercules is one of the better entertainments of the summer , a big tasty bowl of frosted sugar bombs . if you want your vitamins this time , you'll have to order a side salad with that . 
indeed , his manner with her borders on outright insolence , but such treatment seems to be exactly what the queen needs to rouse her from her gloom . brown had been a love story , it would be a pretty poor excuse for one . jeremy brock's script offers far too few scenes between the two principles , providing very little sense of the basis for those rumors ; their relationship is as much a rumor to viewers of the film as to the scandal-mongers it portrays . victoria's devotion to brown remains unexplored , the feelings of both parties purely a matter of conjecture . brown isn't a love story at all . instead , it's a drama of political intrigue , both on a national scale and within the queen's own household . the monarchy is no longer inviolate in the eyes of the public , the idea of abolishing it no longer heretical . brown is quite effective as a portrait of rumor as political lever , as well as the changing perception of monarchy . brown works as a companion piece to another recent film about the british crown in turmoil , the madness of king george -- think of this one as the sadness of queen victoria . the household politics are less clearly drawn , due largely to the uneven characterization of brown . brown refuses to suffer fools of any social station , a quality which is both his greatest asset and his greatest fault . his motivations , however , fluctuate too frequently -- at times he seems self-serving , at other times insanely devoted to victoria . it is antony sher's performance as disraeli which really makes mrs . brown worth watching , capturing the work of a consummate politician in an era when consummate politicians were few and far between . brown were half as compelling behind the doors of balmoral castle as it is behind the doors of parliament , it could have been as fine a romantic tragedy as it is a piece of political theater . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : cedric klapisch . director : cedric klapisch . mpaa rating : r ( adult themes , sexual situations , profanity ) running time : 92 minutes . paris has rarely looked more modern -- or less romantic -- on film . though this all may sound quite depressing , it's actually nothing of the kind . he has a particularly good time with chloe , played with an arresting sweetness by garance clavel . the film's final optimistic note makes her struggles all the more appealing . there isn't much narrative momentum to chloe's adventures -- when the cat's away functions mostly as a walking tour of contemporary parisian heartache , emphasis on the " walking " -- but there is a genuineness to each one . the many characters in when the cat's away are looking for love in a lot of the wrong places , but at least most of them are still looking . chloe's quest is really a search for the romantic paris of song and story , one which may no longer exist , though it may please the heart to believe that it does . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
as feel-good formulaic as it may be in its own way , shall we dance ? also demonstrates a kind of charming restraint you don't often find in american films . in a hollywood film , you can bet that sub-plot would be turned into a stream of slapstick comedy and crazy misunderstandings . in shall we dance ? , writer/director masayuki suo dispenses with it in a matter of minutes , using it to set up later character interactions rather than letting it overwhelm the story with pratfalls . suo gives his comedy the graceful movements of his subject matter , allowing the humor to flow from the characters rather than forcing it upon them . an opening prologue in shall we dance ? goes to some effort to place the film in a sociological perspective , explaining how contrary ballroom dancing is to the japanese sense of propriety . it's a forced message in a story which doesn't need such a culture-specific angle . plays the role of a singles' mixer , with everyone vaguely embarrassed to be there yet taking the opportunity to try on new personalities . sugiyama's awakening is less overt , but koji yakusho does a wonderful job showing a transformation of small steps . it's a delicate performance with a huge heart . shall we dance ? is a fairly lightweight experience , which makes its final half hour rather a long sit . suo crams a lot of exposition into very little time , including an unnecessarily detailed back-story for mai , resulting in a sluggish march towards the resolution . it is here that shall we dance ? feels most hollywood-conventional , attempting to blind-side the audience with a truckload of emotional catharsis . that's the real joy of dance shall we dance ? conveys : its ability to create an intoxicating mood of romance which can soften the stiffest shirt . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
watching the most infectious comic moment in the british import the full monty -- a film rich with infectious comic moments -- can teach you a lot about what so many hollywood comedies get so wrong . it's a wonderful bit of comic film-making , surprisingly restrained and staged with impeccable momentum and timing . it also comes in a context which gives the laughter more bite . their spontaneous burst of energy in that dole queue is a physical manifestation of optimism . they're trying something to become men again , by god , even if it's as ridiculous a notion as dropping trou -- or going " the full monty " in brit-speak -- in front of 400 howling women . now i'm not saying it isn't worth several chuckles simply watching the out-of-shape mates muddle their way through their pirouettes and pelvic thrusts ; incongruity is the mother of classic physical comedy . i'm willing to wager , however , that a hollywoodized version of the full monty would miss the point entirely . in this hypothetical american monty , the idea of six working-class blokes becoming strippers , none of them ideal physical specimens , would be treated as inherently hilarious . it would become a broad farce , with chris farley re-creating his " saturday night live " sketch challenging patrick swayze for a spot in the chippendales line-up . the full monty isn't an effective comedy because the stars are unattractive . it's an effective comedy because the characters _are_ attractive , because their dilemma is genuine and their solution is ripe with possibilities . ironically , the most noteworthy flaws in the full monty might have been erased by a good old hollywood script doctoring . screenwriter simon beaufoy dangles a few too many plot threads for no apparent reason , including a gay romance which never matters much to the story . dramatic confrontations interfere with the comedic flow , as though beaufoy didn't trust the performances and basic plot situations to generate enough sympathy for his characters . though not nearly as pedantic as the similarly-themed brassed off ! , the full monty still treads dangerously close to pathos at times , clashing with the lads' growing enthusiasm for their new calling . the full monty may be a high-concept premise , but the execution is resolutely low-concept . that's a combination hollywood is having a tough time putting together in its comedies . comedy with ideas doesn't have to be leaden ; comedy with big laughs doesn't have to be simple-minded . the full monty gives depth to dole-line disco . . . _that's_ high comedy . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , violence , brief nudity ) running time : 140 minutes . early though it may be to make such a prediction , i'm going to do so : no one will be more deserving of an adapted screenplay oscar in 1997 than brian helgeland and curtis hanson . james ellroy's 1990 novel " l . a . confidential " was 496 pages of sprawling , tangled plotting and a staccato prose style in which entire chapters seemed to fly by without a single verb rearing its active little head . even the author himself said he didn't always know what was going on at any given time . hanson and helgeland took that narrative and tamed it into an intricate but accessible crime drama . they remained true to both the style and gritty substance of the story while giving it the appeal of pop entertainment . which is not to say that they have created an unqualified triumph . l . a . confidential is the kind of sturdy , satisfying studio vehicle which turns up rarely enough that it's easy to mistake it for a minor masterpiece . it's well-crafted but never dazzling , consistently interesting without being engrossing . helgeland and hanson haven't exactly taken an unfilmable novel and turned it into a classic . they've taken a novel which would have been a three hour art film and made a 140-minute mainstream multiplex success . there's more than a whiff of chinatown to l . a . confidential -- it's hard not to break into a chuckle when one character appears with a jake gittes memorial nose bandage -- but the story manages to stake out its own unique territory in exposing the dark side of booming post-war los angeles . it does a particularly impressive job of hooking into the relationship between high-profile crime and the media , skewering the public's inexhaustible appetite for sordid tales about which they can feel morally superior . curtis hanson's direction manages to navigate a smart path between the glossy image of hollywood and the sleazy reality . it's a perfectly appropriate ambiguity that l . a . confidential ( photographed by the talented dante spinotti ) may be one of the best-looking films ever made about ugly doings . it's also appropriate that the characters are similarly ambiguous , complex people whose motivations are never as pure or as selfish as they appear at first glance . another of the accomplishments in this fine script is that those characters feel softer and more humanized than they do in ellroy's novel , easier to sympathize with . yet one of the problems with l . a . confidential is that while the characters are uniformly well-acted and multi-dimensional , there's not enough time to get under the skin of any one character . we find ourselves surprised by some of the decisions the characters make , but once we understand a single basic motivation for each one there's not much left to learn about them . pearce , crowe and spacey do solid work with solid characters . they're never boring , and never fascinating . hanson and helgeland still do an impressive enough job that i couldn't help wishing they had trusted their own skill with material a bit more . the plot twists of l . a . confidential may be a lot to take in , but not so much that they require the constant nudging the script and direction provide . every character is identified in bold letters ( sometimes literally ) , every significant development is accompanied by a flashback or wordy exposition to make sure we realize the significance , and whole chunks of the film are summarized at various points like chapter-ending cliff's notes . it all gives a smart film the feeling that it's not quite so smart after all , or that the audience isn't expected to be smart enough to figure it all out . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
proceed no further , gentle reader , if you are of a delicate constitution or prefer to see your films with no potential surprises revealed : i am about to " out " in & out . it's all a big misunderstanding , he claims , based on his cleanliness , his sense of style , and his inordinate fondness for the barbra streisand oeuvre . don't be deceived , gentle reader . plants a 15-second kiss on his lips . an audible gasp rustled through the auditorium where i saw the film when the audience suddenly realized it had been duped . a woman near me muttered , " that is disgusting . " mr . and mrs . john q . heterosexual-american , expecting a straight farce from in & out -- emphasis on " straight " -- may be in for a very rude awakening . i'm not averse to rude awakenings as a rule ; in fact , i think cinema in particular could use a lot more of them . in this case , however , the premise they're selling is so much more interesting than the premise they end up using . for about half its running time , in & out is heading in the right direction , but as soon as howard admits that he's gay , it feels like all the satirical energy has been sapped from the film . it becomes just another sincere plea for tolerance and understanding -- pleasant and laudable , but lacking bite . it's tough to be too hard on in & out , because rudnick's script is so often so sharp . the cast supports the script with uniformly solid work , particularly joan cusack in a brilliant physical performance which turns a wedding dress into a spectacularly versatile comic prop . kevin kline's performance is also satisfying . . . at least half of it is . he just doesn't know what to do with himself once he comes out , nor does the script know what to do with him . for the final half hour , howard simply sits around waiting for the people of greenleaf , indiana either to accept him or reject him . i'm not sure if director frank oz ( housesitter , dirty rotten scoundrels ) could have made a film with the kind of dead-eye social commentary the " straight " in & out would have required . i would have liked to see him try , though . this is one of the year's few unquestionably funny comedies , yet it's also one of the most frustrating . give the paramount marketing department credit for coming up with one of the most hilarious comic plots in recent memory , the plot to the great film in & out _almost_ was . instead , it's here , and it's queer , and i guess we'll have to get used to it . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
here's an easy short-hand for thinking about the peacemaker : it's a james bond film without james bond . okay , so there's no sex and no vodka martinis , but the peacemaker comes with virtually everything else you could ask for in an espionage thriller : superbly crafted action sequences , a charismatic hero , marvelous production values , the threat of mass destruction , humor and style . at times , it's as satisfying an action film as 1997 has produced to date . that's bound to come as a surprise considering the folks both behind and in front of the camera . her sense of timing an action scene , ably assisted by editor david rosenbloom , creates tension in unlikely places ; her instinct for effective restraint ( like the positively heretical decision to show two trains hurtling towards one another , then cut away before the collision ) is uncommon and welcome . leder instantly distinguishes herself as a big-screen action director to watch for . george clooney , meanwhile , has previously distinguished himself on the big screen largely by not distinguishing himself , disappearing into the frenetic horror of from dusk till dawn and the inane vortex that was batman & robin . devoe displays an often ruthless military pragmatism , yet his very refusal to play politics gives many of his comic lines their bite . he's no bond , of course , which points out the one glaring deficiency keeping the peacemaker from being a great action film . the bond films' awareness of their own high-flying absurdity forced them to avoid self-importance , while also making it easy for viewers to overlook mediocre scripts . not only is michael schiffer's screenplay for the peacemaker too serious by half , it feels only half-finished . instead of an arrogantly megalomaniacal villain , or even an appealingly insane one , schiffer offers a somber , haunted bosnian surrounded by the somber , haunted ruins of sarajevo . leder adds a touch of irony with a passing shot of sarajevo's olympic rings , at least momentarily defusing the impression that the peacemaker is trying to make a political statement . as for the characters . . . let's just call them functional . there's a mechanical feel to the narrative flow of the peacemaker ; it moves from place to place or person to person with little connective tissue to hold it all together . it's an action machine , albeit an extremely well-oiled one . well-oiled action machines are rare enough that the peacemaker could find a receptive audience , perhaps the same audience anxiously awaiting james bond's next adventure . operating without a compelling script or the built-in goodwill which accompanies the planet's most famous secret agent , mimi leder and company manage to create a worthy challenger . with competition like bond , it's impressive that leder was neither shaken nor stirred . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
director : mark waters . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , sexual situations , violence ) running time : 85 minutes . norman rockwell would not approve of what the movies are doing to thanksgiving . this fall , no fewer than three new releases -- the ice storm , the myth of fingerprints and the house of yes -- are turning turkey day into dysfunction junction . at least mark waters , screenwriter and director of the house of yes , seems to understand that the recrimination-filled holiday gathering has already become a film cliche . the house of yes is a black comedy not at all concerned about making its family feuds a touch surreal . the year is significant because it marks the 20th anniversary of the assassination of president kennedy , a date which holds even more significance for the pascals than for most americans . waters adapted the house of yes from a play by wendy macleod , and you can hear the theatrical roots in every line of dialogue . posey , prinze and bujold exchange clipped quips with the practiced air of a company in mid-run , lines building on top of one another at a dizzying pace . waters' direction also tends towards the conventional , usually holding the speaker in medium shot then shifting immediately to the next speaker . ordinarily , a production this uniformly stagy would feel forced and awkward on the screen , but not the house of yes . as it turns out , this is a story of overly dramatic people living a self-conscious soap opera . appropriately enough ( if unexpectedly ) , tori spelling delivers the film's most naturalistic performance ; the rest of this clan is like the addams family , so immersed in their own singularly demented world that they don't even see anything out of the ordinary . the script also keeps the wicked humor coming so regularly that you may not notice the arch deliveries ( or at least not mind them ) . the dialogue is fast , funny and quirky enough to defuse some touchy subject matter . for most of the film's running time , waters refuses to treat the pascals' family skeletons as tragedies . it's late in the film when the house of yes takes its most ill-advised turn , going exactly the somber and serious route it had so carefully side-stepped . the last shot in particular seems to ask for a careful psychological analysis , potentially rendering jackie-o as a guiltless , misunderstood victim . it's a jarring miscalculation which takes a satire of dysfunction dramas and turns it into something which leaves a dysfunction drama taste in your mouth . the house of yes should have stuck with what it was doing best : providing an alternative thanksgiving meal , something salty and bitter without a trace of saccharine . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : bart freundlich . director : bart freundlich . the myth of fingerprints is a subtle , restrained film in a genre crying out for a little subtlety and restraint . yet the myth of fingerprints isn't about raised voices , cathartic confrontations or healing embraces . many viewers might find the myth of fingerprints rather inconsequential in its paucity of fireworks and dirty laundry . it has become so commonplace for such stories to center on big revelations -- who confesses to being gay , who turns out to be a child molester , who's been unfaithful to whom ( or _with_ whom ) -- that it's almost disappointing when they're absent . neither are there many resolutions , with some relationships just as unstable at the fade-out as they were at the fade-in . bart freundlich's script is about relatively mundane familial discord , but it's expertly observed mundanity . if there is one major stumbling block in the myth of fingerprints , it's the lack of sufficient time to do justice to its broad canvas . freundlich has so many characters and so many relationships to cover that he inevitably short-changes some of them , perhaps even all of them . he's fortunate that he has such a stellar cast to fill in the spaces , particularly moore and davis . there is an ease to the way the characters interact , even in their uneasiness , which makes it easy to get caught up in the simple tensions . the confidence with which freundlich directs the myth of fingerprints practically forces you to concede that this story matters . to paraphrase tolstoy , every unhappy family is unhappy in its own unique way . this one happens to be unhappy quietly , but its an unhappiness worth exploring . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : ed neumeier , based on the novel by robert a . heinlein . director : paul verhoeven . mpaa rating : r ( violence , gore , nudity , sexual situations ) running time : 129 minutes . devotees of robert a . heinlein , be forewarned : paul verhoeven's starship troopers is less an adaptation of heinlein's novel than it is a literary satire . the author's jingo-all-the-way militarism and his tendency to create plastic characters with plastic conflicts had me expecting a soulless , faceless parade of carnage from the film version . and i suppose that's exactly what verhoeven delivers , with sometimes hilarious results . heinlein's basic motifs are so faithfully rendered that their flaws become a source of amusement , while their strengths become the stuff of high-energy entertainment . outlining the plot of starship troopers is a fairly silly endeavor , since it's basically a big bug hunt . . . aliens in broad daylight . so if starship troopers is another movie where one-dimensional characters wade through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of aliens , what makes it any better than , say , independence day , a movie where one-dimensional characters waded through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of slightly different aliens ? for one thing , you sense that the film-makers are aware of the pulp nonsense they have as source material . the very absence of major stars in the cast feels thematically appropriate , not just fiscally prudent . if starship troopers had been turned into a tv-movie , aaron spelling would have produced it . it's a story which requires emoting , not acting ; it's a prime time soap opera with big guns , played for all the dopey melodrama it's worth . the no-name cast also plays into verhoeven's treatment of heinlein's most controversial conceit . these characters really are just " fresh meat for the grinder , " as one character puts it , which makes their lack of familiarity all the more fitting . it's not that starship troopers is anti-military , because it never treats the true horror of war as anything but a great big , violent video game . verhoeven is actually having it both ways -- he's making fun of gung-ho boosterism even as he fires his fresh-faced recruits into battle on a gung-ho booster rocket of visual effects . if that makes starship troopers hypocritical , at least it's enthusiastically staged hypocrisy . there may not be a person worth caring about in the whole film , but it moves like nobody's business . verhoeven stages some thrilling action sequences , sending swarms of bugs after the anonymous grunts then having various body parts strewn about the screen like landscaping . it is that rare special effects blockbuster which demonstrates a sense of pacing to match its budget ; i was caught up in the action enough of the time that i wasn't perpetually groaning over the absence of real human beings . i wish i could find it in myself to work up more outrage over the callous way humans are dispatched in starship troopers , but it didn't work out that way . that would be punishing verhoeven for getting to the heart of his material . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
the best documentaries manage to uncover truths deeper than their most obvious subjects ; the best documentarians recognize that they can use the film medium to tell stories as compelling as anything fictional . 4 little girls , a powerful tale of tragic loss turned into positive action , is more than the sort of " talking head " video textbook most people envision when they think of conventional documentaries . it is the work of a film-maker who knows how to provoke viewers while he educates them , who has experience examining the challenging subject of race in america . through photographs and interviews with family and friends , we come to know the four girls not merely as symbols , but as individuals , remembered fondly as vibrant lives cut short . 4 little girls creates a vivid portrait of alabama in the 1960s , rich with detailed characterizations which make it feel like lee always has his eye towards creating a narrative . for all the historical detail , lee never loses sight of the centerpiece of the film . it's unfortunate that lee follows those scenes with the indictment and trial of " dynamite bob " chambliss for the killings , by far the weakest sequence in the film . it may have provided a necessary closure to show the criminal eventually brought to justice , but 4 little girls is much more powerful detailing how this tragedy became a catalyst for change in the public perception of southern racism was affected around the world . lee also offers frightening comparisons to the recent spate of black church burnings in the south , highlighting his ability to make the film many things at once -- a memorial , a history lesson , an opportunity for healing , a warning to stay vigilant . 4 little girls is a gripping experience , an epic testament to triumph over hatred which never forgets the very personal loss of four families who still miss their four little girls . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : quentin tarantino , based on the novel " rum punch " by elmore leonard . producer : lawrence bender . director : quentin tarantino . a lot of those same folks are going to see jackie brown as a validation of their suspicions . after all , it's not the kind of dizzying , heart-stopping morality-play-disguised-as-nihilism pulp fiction was . both fans and foes of tarantino tend to fixate on his writing , but jackie brown may prove once and for all that the man is a remarkably talented film director . he does things with his camera that keep viewers off-balance , while avoiding the swooping ostentation of many young film-makers . at times , he will linger on a shot just after a character has moved out of frame ; at other times , he may shoot a conversation from behind the characters' backs . in one hilariously perfect scene , he uses complete darkness to build tension , complemented by an expertly handled split-screen to deliver the punch line . he directs a scene with such confidence that he can convince a viewer to follow wherever he's leading , because it always seems to be somewhere slightly unexpected . he's also got a gift for directing actors most directors will never have . in jackie brown , tarantino resurrects the careers of not one , but two forgotten actors of the 1970s . grier does fine work , but it's robert forster who breaks out of jackie brown with a superb performance . a veteran of b-grade cop shows like " nakia " and " banyon , " forster plays the world-weary cherry with natural charisma and a touching affection for jackie . in a cast full of heavy hitters like samuel l . jackson and robert deniro ( both of whom are also top-notch ) , grier and forster make an unexpected romance between two people past their hollywood-pretty prime funny , sexy and convincing . it's true that jackie brown includes plenty of familiar elements from previous tarantino efforts : bursts of unpredictable violence , twelve-letter profanities by the truck-load , non-linear narrative , creative use of old songs ( doing for " strawberry letter #23 " what reservoir dogs did for " stuck in the middle with you " ) . it's also true that jackie brown moves at the kind of measured pace which could have some tarantino fans tapping their toes with impatience . it's not an instant classic , just a sharp piece of entertainment with the kind of tightly-structured script you wish tarantino could teach to other writers . i found it hard not to smile virtually from start to finish in jackie brown -- not because it's constantly amusing , but because it's such a pleasure to be in the hands of someone who knows how to use the medium . even if it's an over-rated , plagiarizing flavor of the month like quentin tarantino . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : robert duvall . director : robert duvall . mpaa rating : pg ( adult themes , mild profanity , brief violence ) running time : 130 minutes . a moment of mild understatement : people of christian faith haven't fared well in film . when hollywood was still afraid to offend , christian characters were flawless , salt-of-the-earth folks ; later , as cinematic taboos vanished through the 60s and 70s , religion became a sure sign of either mental illness or hypocrisy . pentecostal minister euliss f . " sonny " dewey , the title character in the apostle , may be the most wonderfully complex christian character ever depicted on film , and every ounce of credit for that creation goes to robert duvall . duvall works wonders with sonny , depicting every possible facet of this complicated man's personality . if there's one major stumbling block in the apostle , it is that the other characters in the film exist entirely to react to sonny . while the performances are uniformly strong and naturalistic , the supporting players rarely seem to have lives of their own . duvall commits so much energy to making this one character completely real that he has little left to spend on anyone else . you may not end up minding all that much , since that one character becomes so fascinating . duvall has long been one of america's finest actors , but this is the kind of role into which he disappears most completely -- slightly roguish but unmistakably human souls like his roles in tender mercies and lonesome dove . when sonny gives his final sermon in the apostle , in a sequence which lingers and builds in intensity , you realize exactly what duvall is aiming at . ultimately , the apostle is a strange sort of character study , because sonny doesn't really change all that much . like most well-intentioned by imperfect people , he just keeps trying to be better . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : elaine may , based on the novel by anonymous . director : mike nichols . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 143 minutes . it's ironic that klein could tell a story about the effect of scandal-mongering on american politics only by creating a bit of scandal himself , that he could uncover a few brutal truths only by hiding a few . it's even more ironic that the film version of primary colors appears just as president clinton finds himself entangled in new scandals , virtually guaranteeing that most coverage of the film will both miss the point entirely and help make the film's point for it . primary colors isn't simply a chance to giggle at clinton's foibles without naming him . this is a story about giggling at foibles masquerading as serious news , about a political process which has become a seemingly endless cycle of mud-slinging and spin control because we continue to create an audience for it . in that sense , it's a very similar story to the recent wag the dog , though simultaneously more human and more cynical . does it matter that this man who wants to do so much for the country seems to be doing it one woman at a time ? do the ends of getting into office where you can do some good justify the means of slinging even more mud at the opponent than he slings at you ? and how can you make ideas worth anything in a culture where viewers watch an interview with the stantons and can only comment that susan " should wear her hair longer . " primary colors the movie manages to wrap all of the novel's tough questions and roman-a-clef characters into a surprisingly funny and entertaining package . though the running time of nearly 2-1/2 hours feels excessive near the end , director mike nichols crafts so many sharp comic scenes that the film never becomes a tedious political science lecture . he also gets one particularly dynamic performance from a generally solid cast -- kathy bates as libby , the stanton's borderline-loony long-time friend and the campaign's designated " dust-buster " ( because she's " tougher than dirt " ) . though the role initially seems like just a minor variation on bates' brassy , no-nonsense characters in dolores claiborne , the late shift or titanic , libby eventually develops into the real soul of primary colors : the last true idealist , a woman whose very sanity depends on the notion that there has to be a better way to select those who will lead us . of course , another performance will draw far more attention , which is precisely why primary colors couldn't possibly work as well on film as it does on the page . without a face , jack stanton is a complex and sympathetic character study representing a wide-spread problem . as effective as elaine may's script may be -- and travolta's performance , for that matter -- plenty of viewers will simply gape at primary colors in tabloid fascination , thinking of it as the bill clinton story . there's a sad lesson behind the laughs in primary colors , one you'll be able to spot in reviews and reactions colored by the lenses of intern-gate , grope-gate , or any other gate : we're getting exactly the leaders we deserve when we refuse to make their messages matter , and all we can do is throw up an endless series of gates in front of them . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : richard kwietniowski , based on the novel by gilber adair . director : richard kwietniowski . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , profanity ) running time : 90 minutes . a widowed british author who studiously avoids all things modern -- or , more precisely , all things _period_ -- de'ath has recently had a completely inadvertent life-changing experience . i'm sure that message was not meant specifically for film critics , but it's a shoe which may fit anyway . much of the humor in the first half of love and death -- and this is , it should be clear , a very sharp comedy -- comes from de'ath's embarassment over the object of his interest . the whole business seems even more shameful to a man of letters who should know better than to watch a film described in a critical summary as having " no redeeming qualities whatsoever . " it's the whole idea of a " guilty pleasure " which love and death takes to task . when he launches into a tangent on film acting at a lecture , he may simply be swooning over ronnie , but he is also attacking a subject with a passion . as perfectly geared towards satire as the phony films-within-a-film may be ( complete with familiar grainy photography and credits like " a huck murphy film " ) , you're forced to move past mocking giggles to acknowledging the genuinely intense response de'ath feels . the credit for that belongs largely to john hurt , who gives a career performance . it's a role which must be perfectly pitched to be sympathetic , because de'ath is , to be frank , a celebrity stalker . hurt makes de'ath absolutely sincere , even if he is the only one who could possibly see greatness in ronnie . such epiphanies are too rare to restrict to the places we're _supposed_ to find epiphanies . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
in an era of soaring stock markets , republican revolutions and enough backlashes to give you whiplash , michael moore is something of an anachronism : part stand-up comic , part guerrilla film-maker but always 100% old-school liberal . moore might be considered one of the most dangerous radicals in america if only you didn't want to giggle every time you saw him . his new documentary the big one is a hilariously unique piece of social commentary as vaudeville , a cross between " 60 minutes " and david letterman which draws most of its laughs from moore's mere presence . the confrontations which make up the backbone of the big one easily could have been humorless kamikaze journalism if not for the fact that it's michael moore holding the microphone . he has an agenda , to be sure , but he's also a splendid performer who makes it look easy drawing his flies with honey rather than vinegar . as entertaining as he may be in full concert mode -- describing how 1996 presidential candidate steve forbes never blinks ; explaining the role of " shareholders " in the u . s . constitution ; suggesting that our country change its name from the boring " united states " to the more intimidating " the big one " -- moore is at his best as the self-effacing goofball who ends up making others look like even bigger goofballs . if knight comes off looking like the devil -- and with his tim curry grin , he certainly looks the part -- it's not because he's acting in the economic best interest of his company . knight simply doesn't have the guts to come out with such an admission , a fact largely attributable to moore's preferred conversational style . it's rather foolish to accuse moore of blantant propagandizing , since he never bothers to hide the fact . occasionally he butts heads with recalcitrant company drones past the point of diminishing returns , and a couple of moments with " average americans " ( including a tearful session at a book signing ) appear either staged or needlessly like photo opportunities . still , it's hard to imagine that even the staunchest libertarian won't find something to smile at in moore's singular tapestry of 1990s americana . that goofy round-faced guy in the baseball cap sure knows how to make a lecture not seem like a lecture . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 113 minutes . first , this important preface : i love wings of desire . wim wenders' lyrical 1988 film , positing angels roaming through berlin and one particular angel fascinated with the human experience , caught me completely by surprise when i first saw it . it was less a narrative than a visual tone poem of division -- between heaven and earth , between monochrome and color , between east and west berlin -- which eventually finds unity . the experience , terribly un-critic-like though it may sound , was spiritually moving . that emotional response contributed significantly to me distaste for wenders' own ill-fated attempt at a sequel , faraway , so close ! ; it similarly led me to dread the impending arrival of the americanized re-make city of angels . why re-make perfection , especially to engage in the typical hollywood reductionism of making it all about the love story between the curious angel and his human object of desire ? perhaps it is because i expected so little that i was so improbably delighted by city of angels . though the decision to play up that relationship was certainly a practical one -- wings of desire's stream-of-consciousness eavesdropping hardly screams " commercial " -- it also gives city of angels its unique identity . the result is sort of a strange cousin to rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead -- a story based on existing characters and situations , yet thematically independent and appealing in its own right . much of that appeal springs from city of angels' commitment to its tone . few mainstream hollywood movies of recent years have been so willing to adopt a reflective pace , to paint broad canvases of human experience and allow us to watch in peace . while never earth-shaking , silberling's compositions are rarely predictable and frequently memorable . it's that rare big-screen movie that uses the big screen , allowing its intimate story to unfold in the grandeur of a massive city . ultimately , it's that intimate story which will win over viewers . cage and ryan make a superb romantic pair , each actor reaching for the longing in their respective characters and connecting that longing to the other . though cage may not be the most obvious choice for a role based on preternatural calm , the intensity percolating beneath his benevolent glances heightens the anticipation of his possible " fall " to humanity . few quibbles about the characters matter , however , when they share the screen ; the sheer force of their eye contact is often enough to wipe away any doubts about their feelings . a story about life-changing emotion is a hard sell to cynical audiences , but cage and ryan sell it . for all its meaphysical musings , there's never any question that city of angels is an old-style hollywood love story , a multi-hanky weeper light years removed from the dream-like wings of desire . it's almost enough to make you forget that angels is based on wings . . . which , for my money , is the best thing that possibly could have happened . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : john sayles . director : john sayles . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 125 minutes . if the term " independent film " means anything in an era when disney owns miramax , it means the work of john sayles . nothing sayles has done through nearly twenty years of film-making has been done the easy way , or the predictable way . so it only stands to reason that sayles would capitalize on the critically-acclaimed , oscar-nominated lone star by making his next film a tale of latin american politics told almost entirely in spanish . men with guns is classic john sayles , which is to say that it will reward most fully the viewer willing to think about it for a while afterwards . this discovery initially baffles fuentes , who can't make sense of why doctors would be a threat to anyone . it is the mad " logic " of this kind of war which becomes one of sayles main themes in men with guns . sayles develops this notion of accepting responsibility for one's actions -- or lack of action -- as fuentes picks up a number of passengers along his way . like many of sayles' films , men with guns stumbles only because sayles never met a two hour plus running time he didn't like . often , they simply feel like padding in a singularly sedate war story . still , sayles working at less than the height of his powers is still a more provocative story-teller -- and an ever-more-mature visual film-maker -- than the vast majority of his contemporaries . he is willing to talk to his audiences rather than shout at them , to allow his films to sneak up on you with their thoughtful confidence . in 1998 , that above all else makes john sayles a truly independent film-maker . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : neil labute . producers : jason patric and steve golin director : neil labute . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 100 minutes . in an era when too many films bludgeon you with exposition , desperately afraid of leaving anyone behind , neil labute says as much with what he refuses to tell you as he does with his words . his blistering 1997 debut in the company of men explored corporate and interpersonal power games without ever naming the company , its product , or the city in which it was located . in so doing , he gave the story an uncomfortable sense of generic familiarity . chuckle at the rhyming name conceit if you will , but that would only be your most immediate reaction if you saw them in the closing credits . you'd spend a bit more time puzzling over the realization that not a single one of those names was ever spoken during the film . for all the memorable conversations labute gives to his characters , your friends & neighbors is really about failure in communication , a failure at achieving any semblance of intimacy . it's a premise just as provocative as that of in the company of men , but it's not executed with quite the same skill . in the company of men was an example of clockwork plotting , leading a viewer to a powerful conclusion in which everything that preceded it suddenly took on greater resonance . your friends & neighbors is more pure character study , less concerned with where the characters are going than with where they are . the few bits of unique composition labute includes , specifically a recurring scene in an art gallery where only the characters change , are more self-consciously clever than revelatory . as intriguing and often darkly comic as your friends & neighbors may be , it doesn't entirely satisfy as a narrative . it's more like a slice of domestic life sliced off with the razor of labute's caustic words -- altman's short cuts as written by david mamet . that still makes your friends & neighbors a cut above the competition , particularly as a showcase for its cast . the women fare less well , with amy brenneman a puzzlement as the unhappy mary , but every one of the six principal performers has at least one gripping moment . your friends & neighbors isn't the icy triumph in the company of men was , but it continues neil labute's unflinching , unnerving examination of language as assault , of every human interaction as a power struggle . he says all the things we're generally unwilling to admit we say . . . and , sometimes , the things we don't say . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
since time immemorial -- memorial day 1996 , to be precise -- one question has plagued movie-goers the world over : what might mission : impossible have looked like if someone had shown the faintest interest in telling a coherent story ? as answer , i give you ronin , an international espionage thriller fueled by as much brain power as adrenaline . the comparison to mission : impossible is almost too easy , especially given the presence of jean reno in both casts , but it's a telling comparison nonetheless . ronin shows how much more effective a film can be when set pieces are connected by ideas . as the operation begins , alliances quickly shift with the prevailing winds , no lofty ideal more important than the exigencies of the moment . that notion both drives the film and provides its title . mission : impossible flirted with the same concept , but it was to turn characters into vengeance-driven super-villains . the characters are sketched in only the most basic terms , in keeping with their private natures , yet they are given presence by actors like deniro and reno bringing mournful weight to their performances . though few words are spoken in the script by j . d . zeik and richard weisz ( a . k . a . david mamet ) , the very lack of human interaction between the characters speaks volumes . for a fairly introspective film , ronin is also a fairly exciting one . director john frankenheimer goes to the car chase well perhaps once too often , but those he uses are tense and well-constructed . the action level is as high in ronin as it has been in any summer blockbuster of the last few years , and it's _better_ action , more white-knuckle gripping than whoop-it-up flashy . for some viewers , that may be reason enough to spend two hours at the movies , but it's all the more impressive because the action serves the story . every subsequent violent encounter raises the stakes in this chaotic world , while it's always clear that the combatants neither know nor care what they're fighting for . ronin certainly has its share of jagged edges , notably the aforementioned opening titles and a distracting romantic sub-plot between deniro and mcelhone . some may find the characters too remote and under-developed , and consequently find it difficult to invest emotionally in the story . i found the chilly isolation of the characters exactly what ineeded to become emotionally invested ; the emptiness of their lives and actions _is_ the hook . this isn't earth-shaking profundity we're talking about , merely the building blocks of effective drama -- the visceral coupled with the intellectual , actions with consequences . consequences were never really an issue in mission : impossible , which makes it that much easier to appreciate what ronin has to offer . it's no longer a james bond landscape of world domination . for once , evil in an espionage thriller isn't what people do , but why they do it . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
people will probably misinterpret the documentary out of the past as much as the controversial event which is at its center , which is irony enough . it would be even more ironic if they misinterpret it in exactly the same way : without any direct knowledge , because they are already convinced they know what it's about . such tends to be the case when you are dealing with the perpetually volatile subject of homosexuality . it happens even more frequently when the suggestion is proferred that gays and lesbians are human beings with much to contribute to the world . its purpose , according to peterson , was understanding -- understanding between gay students that they were not going through the difficult experience alone , understanding between gay and straight students that gays were not aliens to be feared or hated . that story alone would be compelling enough to make for a solid piece of documentary film-making . peterson emerges as a determined , remarkably mature young woman with a surprisingly wry sense of humor about the uproar she never meant to cause . it's fascinating and entertaining simply watching her calm determination in the face of parents who announce their concerns in board meetings that exposure to homosexuality will be a dangerous influence on impressionable teenagers . they desire nothing less than the invisibility of homosexuals , believing perhaps that if no one talks about them , they will simply go away . that widely-held societal belief drives even more fascinating secondary story in out of the past -- a series of biographical vignettes intertwined with kelli peterson's struggle . like many " talking head " documentaries , out of the past does have its slow patches , and not all the biographical sketches are uniformly enlightening . ultimately , however , the film does what it sets out to do : it places kelli peterson in a historical context , validating the legacy which she had been denied . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : charles leavitt , based on the novel _freak the mighty_ by rodman philbrick . director : peter chelsom . mpaa rating : pg ( mild profanity , adult themes ) running time : 95 minutes . the resulting film was mawkish and erratic , sacrificing strong and consistent characterizations for cheap slapstick and even cheaper melodrama . i love the cosmic symmetry that allows me to point out exactly what's right about one film because of what went wrong in another . yet the mighty is superior to simon birch in almost every way . it's a family film about triumph over adversity that earns honest emotional response . you might expect the mighty to be just a glorified " afterschool special , " unless you knew the work of director peter chelsom . the auteur behind the eccentric gems hear my song and funny bones gives the story a fantastic flair , with images of the symbiotic duo crossing swords with enemies in their flights of fancy . even the scenes clearly designed to draw cheers , including a gym class basketball game , somehow seem too surreal to be manipulative . the mighty has more than its share of messages , yet it rarely feels like a " message movie . " it has more than its share of shifts in tone , yet it rarely feels inconsistent . give credit both to chelsom and to his two young leads , who deliver a pair of superb performances . kieran culkin ( yes , _his_ younger brother ) finds the fine line between intelligent and obnoxious -- a line most young actors trample into dust -- to make kevin an appealing protagonist . elden henson , however , provides the film's real emotional core as the deeply troubled max . ably assisted by restrained , dignified supporting turns from stone , rowlands and stanton , culkin and henson create a solid dramatic foundation . the sub-plot's darker tone , involving murder and kidnapping , are challenging enough to fit into a family film without gandolfini playing the role as a leering monster . yet even then chelsom rallies to give us a potent climax without an ounce of fat . the power of the story , and its convincing bonds of friendship , make teary-eyed actors and sweeping musical cues utterly unnecessary . the mighty builds two characters worth caring about . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : robert benigni and vincenzo cerami . producers : elda ferri and gianluigi braschi . director : roberto benigni mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes ) running time : 114 minutes . life is beautiful , a fancifully dark italian comedy from co-writer/director/star roberto benigni , has inspired one of the most misguided criticisms of recent years . the criticism leveled at life is beautiful is that it is a sanitized version of the holocaust , which somehow diminishes the gravity of the tragedy by squeezing humor from it . the absurdity of that criticism is that it seems to miss the point entirely . benigni crafts a sensitive relationship between the father and son , as guido's wit and imagination allow him to create a world of pleasure and hope where no pleasure or hope should be possible . there are more than enough grim reminders of the camp's true purpose -- as well as a glimpse of banal evil in the character of an obliviously self-absorbed physician ( horst buchholz ) -- to dismiss any notion that benigni as a film-maker is candy-coating one of the bleakest chapters in human history . the irony of that misguided criticism is that there's a much simpler reason to be less than dazzled by life is beautiful -- namely , most of the first hour . in essence , it's an _extremely_ extended prologue , introducing us to guido as a carefree seeker of love and fortune who directs his creative energies towards winning dora's heart . the pleasant scenes between them certainly establish their bond , as well as guido's imaginative gifts , but on their own they're fairly innocuous bits of romantic tomfoolery . benigni mixes physical comedy with the occasional social commentary , all with moderate success and the sense that he's just passing time until he can get to the real meat of the story . it's easy to imagine benigni setting up all the necessary relationships in about half the time , making the shift in tone less abrupt . . . and making shifting in your seat less necessary . none of that detracts from the potent , bittersweet pleasures of the film's second half . all of the things that could have gone wrong instead go right -- the young cantarini radiates charming innocence without cloying self-awareness ; benigni hits just the right balance between clown and unlikely hero ; the darker moments always feel consistent with the human comedy . life is beautiful grows richer by the minute , making it easy to forgive the amiable but meandering first half . if it hadn't takeng quite so long to reach its most powerful scenes , life is beautiful would have been an easy choice as one of the year's best films . an expression as trite as " triumph of the human spirit " doesn't quite do justice to what benigni has pulled off here . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
a couple of years ago , i began reading scott smith's novel a simple plan and never made it to the halfway point . there was nothing particularly wrong with the plot -- a moody cautionary tale about the resulting spiral of guilt and violence when three men find $4 . 4 million in a wrecked plane -- nor did smith's prose style offend in any way . it seemed to me a terrible mistake , one made identification with one specific character too explicit . intriguing though the premise may have been , i couldn't get past hearing hank mitchell's voice while watching his story unfold . sam raimi's screen version of a simple plan shows how easy it can be to improve on a novel when point-of-view is its only real flaw . only there is harm done . a simple plan offers an object lesson in any number of cliched moral bon mots : crime doesn't pay , there certainly isn't any honor among thieves , and love of money is indeed the root of all evil . it's a tale of what we're made of at our core , and how little it takes to strip away the civilization in a man like hank and turn him into a savage . that probably doesn't sound like the kind of material one usually associates with raimi ( the evil dead , darkman ) , a director whose camera often seems to need a dose of ritalin . he certainly tones down his hyperkinetic visuals , but he loses none of his energy , which is why a simple plan never feels like a simplistic morality play . he merely harnesses that energy into scenes of superbly crafted tension , where the moments before critical decisions linger with almost unbearable anticipation . raimi allows you to feel the weight of every bad choice , every life-threatening turning point . it's a thriller as full of genuine dread as anything a major studio has produced in recent years . it's also a thriller full of genuine pathos , thanks to a masterful supporting performance by billy bob thornton . as confused as he is physically grotesque , he provides the sense of emotional consequence most plot-driven thrillers lack . the one drawback to thornton's intense work is that he makes his castmates look weak by comparison ; bridget fonda's calculating sarah rings particularly false at times . a simple plan overreaches its grasp a bit during the final act when a sinister figure arrives to threaten the plan , but by then raimi and smith have gotten you so wrapped up in what their characters will do next that you're willing to follow wherever they lead . smith's first-person narrative in written form made this a tale of one man's descent . on the screen , a simple plan lets you identify with every character and experience the chilly , chilling dark night of several souls . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : philip lazebnik . producers : penny finkelman cox and sandra rabins . mpaa rating : pg ( adult themes ) running time : 97 minutes . there's precaution , and then there's what dreamworks has done to insure that the prince of egypt would not become a lightning rod for controversy . religious leaders were consulted on early drafts of the script ; word went forth that this would be a serious , respectful dramatic film with no disney-style animals for comic relief . the film-makers even attached an opening disclaimer about " artistic license " taken with the story , which also referred viewers to the book of exodus for the biblical story of moses . the public relations message has been strong and consistent : befitting its subject matter , the prince of egypt would be a different sort of animated film . in some very important ways , that message was completely accurate . while god is certainly present in the film , the religious elements have been subsumed to the human elements . it's a tricky element to introduce -- that we should care about a personal tragedy in this tale of god's commitment to the hebrews -- but it works to give the film the feel of a mature drama rather than just another animated fairy tale . with such a strong foundation , it becomes distracting when the prince of egypt adopts the rhythms and songs of a typical animated musical . stephen schwartz's tunes are generally solid , but it becomes too easy to think of the film as nothing special when the structure ventures into such familiar territory . there's no need for a biblical epic to turn into " les miserables , " or the old testament equivalent of " jesus christ superstar " , particularly when the images unaccompanied by music are so compelling . there's enough story to this story , and enough vision to the animation , not to require a tune every 10 minutes . in a way , the inclusion of musical numbers could have been an attempt to make the prince of egypt a transitional form of feature animation . it was no surprise to find a screening audience filled with children ; it was , however , something of a surprise to notice them so engaged in such a somber , challenging story . perhaps the songs , and the occasional flashes of humor , served to ease younger viewers into something not so far removed from the videos that line their parents' shelves . dreamworks tackled an incredibly challenging task in the prince of egypt , the task of turning scripture into family entertainment . it's about as successful a conclusion to that task as i can imagine , one which combines tradition and imagination into a powerful animated experience . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
there's more than a touch of irony to the title of the last days , the first feature film project from steven spielberg's shoah foundation . it's this concern with the world of the survivors -- rather than simply the world of the concentration camp internees -- that makes the last days more than " just another holocaust documentary . " the film is told entirely by witnesses to the holocaust , without a moment of narration , yet accounts of attrocities in the camps make up a relatively small portion of the film . there are certainly many powerful recollections in the survivor testimony , the kind that can make you cry out in pain . director james moll also uncovers rare footage for which no adjectives will suffice , images shot by liberating allied forces of skeletal survivors walking in a ghostly parade . if there is anywhere it disappoints , it is in capturing the uniqueness of this particular " before . " bill basch ruefully notes in the film's opening moments the absurdity of hitler's late push to add the hungarian jews to his european slaughter -- " killing jews , " basch says , " was more important than winning the war " -- but moll doesn't build on that premise . while his focus on the survivors keeps the story personal , it doesn't allow for a perspective on what was happening in the bigger picture of 1944 , and how a different allocation of resources by the germans might have changed that picture . accounts of how hungarians believed the stories drifting in from poland could never happen in their own country feel more like generic back-story than a context for this particular phase of the genocide . there is still 35 minutes of screen time left when the war ends , leaving us with stories of our five narrators trying to pick up the pieces . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : john august . director : doug liman . in this cinematic era a . q . we just can't seem to help ourselves -- when we're not noting ways tarantino has cribbed from his film-making forebears , we're noting the ways his acolytes have cribbed from him . when a film like go appears , so like pulp fiction in both narrative structure and style , it's easy to dismiss it on a comparative basis without discussing why the tarantino oeuvre has become the greenwich mean time for an entire genre -- the edgy , after-hours comic thriller . it's easy to miss why director doug liman's film works in the ways it understands tarantino's unique touch , and doesn't work in the ways it fails to understand . like pulp fiction , go involves several non-chronological yet intertwined stories of los angeles denizens with less than glowing morals . there's something to be said for a film with the ability to grab you viscerally , which is one of the tricks go manages to pull off . that description isn't just about pacing ( though go moves with the hypnotic momentum of a rave beat ) , nor is it just about the level of violence and action ( though there's one kicker of a car chase through vegas ) . like the most memorable moments in pulp fiction , the most memorable moments in go energize you with the sense that you're really not sure what's going to happen next . at key junctures , you realize that screenwriter john august is in complete command of his narrative as he turns expectations upside down in ways that make perfect sense , not just because he can . that's not to say that go doesn't wander off on tangents just because they might prove to be entertaining . like much of tarantino's work , it's a loose and sloppy sort of a film , which doesn't mean that there's no logic to what's going on . it's just the logic of giving an audience one heck of a ride , letting the characters stroll and stray because the film-makers have created an atmosphere where we trust they'll stroll somewhere interesting . unlike much of tarantino's work , however , there's not much going on beneath the glittering surface of go . the closest it gets to a thematic link is the idea that these young people dash into dangerous situations with little restraint on their desire to . . . well , to go . there's nothing resembling the moral center of pulp fiction , nor do august and liman show nearly as much affection for their flawed , self-absorbed characters . the performances are solid even when the chattery dialogue feels a bit forced , giving us plenty of reason to follow the characters even when they seem like hopeless screw-ups , but no one is experiencing a fundamental life change . go is a dazzling demonstration of how good even a derivative sort of film can be when someone grasps the basic principles of engrossing film-making . it also demonstrates what we talk about when we talk about tarantino -- a way of telling us something about humanity between the bursts of dialogue and gunfire . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : anne rapp . producers : robert altman and etchie stroh . director : robert altman . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 117 minutes . apparently he decided he hadn't yet explored it in all possible depth , because he's back in dixie for cookie's fortune . the region's easy rhythms and idiosyncracies seem to suit the film-maker well , and he seems to be having a heck of a good time with his visits there . cookie's fortune finds altman laying down a blues jam of intertwining characters spiced with a deft , dry comic touch into a surprising , off-beat entertainment . cookie's fortune is probably most easily summarized as a southern spin on fargo's tale of polite , common-sense police investigation , but that doesn't entirely capture the film's quirky rhythms . yet even as camille's plans begin to unravel , cookie's fortune is less about the suspense and tension of guilt exposed than it is about the pleasures of watching it meander to its inevitable conclusion . as it is in many altman films , the plot -- well-constructed as it is by anne rapp -- works best as a place for a handful of appealing performances to unfold . and there are certainly plenty of appealing performances , of which close's is only the most gaudy . even chris o'donnell , so often an attractive blank hole as an actor , acquits himself well in the ideal role of a puppydog-eager-to-please deputy . fortunately she's a rare false note in altman's smooth orchestration . cookie's fortune is the kind of unconventional narrative of lingering takes that may leave some viewers shifting in their seats waiting for the point of it all . for altman , in this particular case , taking the time to get to the point is actually part of the point . it's a comedy of details dropped in almost off-handedly , and others -- a hand literally caught in the cookie jar , for instance -- underlined at just the right moment . it doesn't add up to all that much either as character study or as crime drama , nor does it take the straightest path between any two points . it's merely a lazy , crazy , consistently amusing diversion about a place where you only know the true measure of a man ( or a woman ) after you've gone fishing together . it's a place altman might consider visiting more often . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
director : alexander payne . this is how i know i'm dealing with a film of uncommon intelligence : election resists the tidy summations in which most films are all-too-eager to wrap themselves . like many recent films , it is a comedy set in a high school , but it's more than just the latest high school comedy . it deals with a student body election , but it's not really _about_ a student body election . it's a film in which characters narrate much of the story , but it doesn't use that narration in a conventional way . like director alexander payne's previous film citizen ruth -- if to a somewhat less successful degree -- election is a satirical scalpel that refuses to let you know exactly when or whom it's going to cut . it would have been easy enough for election to turn into a broad comedy about adolescent peer politics , and it _still_ would have been more insightful than most teen comedies . payne and co-writer jim taylor , working from tom perrotta's novel , have bigger targets in mind . tracy flick's campaign casts her as a political cousin of our current president , seeking election as a " you really like me " validation rathern than out of a desire to serve ; even her nomination speech parrots the naming-of-names , i-feel-your-pain personal touch . even the ridiculous posters , filled with little more than sloganeering , seem disturbingly similar to national election campaigning . it's savvy , cynical , and very funny . even more effective is payne's use of that old literary device the " unreliable narrator " as counterpoint to his direction . only paul , perhaps too dense to be duplicitous , seems pure of heart . as he did in citizen ruth , payne explores the way we convince ourselves that our motivations are pure , even when we don't really understand what our motivations are . if payne stumbles anywhere , it's in his choice to focus much of the film's second half on mcallister's domestic troubles . but election is too smart to be derailed by this problem , too clear-eyed in its study of good intentions muddled by psychological baggage . with surprising sympathy towards all his flawed characters , alexander payne creates a furiously funny film in which his surrealistic directing touches keep the audience off-guard . he understands that in a world where people can't even summarize themselves in a neat-and-tidy sentence , we can't expect to summarize the movies about them that way . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
not to be glib , but there are two very simple reasons why so many romantic comedies are so bad : 1 ) no romance ; 2 ) no comedy . the structure is so simple it could be banged out by monkeys -- find two characters , put them together , introduce an obstacle , tear them apart , resolve the obstacle , bring them back together again . that's where every romantic comedy script begins , and sadly , that's also where most of them end . see , there's the not-so-small matter of creating two likeable characters whose pairing is as plausible as their separation , as well as entertaining the audience along the way to the foregone conclusion . when your audience is ready and willing to be charmed , a film's inability to generate wit or warmth is inexcusable . anna , the hounded subject of perpetual press coverage , is understandably guarded ; william , though a bit dazzled , is understated in his treatment of the star . the romantic side of notting hill works most effectively because curtis and director roger michell ( persuasion ) allow it to develop in stages . crackling with chemistry together , both stars give assured , engaging performances while still leaving a few rough edges -- anna's prickly preoccupation with the perils of her fame , william's addiction to the " love heroin " of his romance with a star . it's convenient that the writer who can put these romantic developments together is also one of the finest comedy writers working . curtis -- a co-creator of both the wonderfully wordy " blackadder " and the purely physical " mr . bean -- has always had an impressive comic range . the solid supporting cast , including tim mcinnerny , hugh bonneville and emma chambers , comes through with appealing work , but it's curtis' wicked way with a line or a visual gag that keeps the comic energy high . notting hill does make the mistake of clocking in at a heavy 125 minutes , dragging out its denouement to an unnecessarily tortuous degree . in fact , there are several occasions where the editing seems disjointed , with odd cutaways and dialogue beginning too early . the technical glitches are perhaps more notable in a film which spins its romance unabashedly into a confection that's pure hollywood , and not just because one of the characters is a hollywood star . this is romantic comedy in an old-fashioned sense , where the pleasures come more from a zestful staging than from foolish details like whether the relationship is " realistic . " notting hill takes you to a slightly heightened reality , a place where movie magic moves you because it has found both the romance and the comedy in romantic comedy . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : erick zonca and roger bohbot . director : erick zonca . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , sexual situations , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 112 minutes . many films have traced the arc of a romantic relationship in which the two principals , despite initial appearances that they are a perfect pair , are destined never to be happy together . the dreamlife of angels is the first film i can recall which traces the arc of a platonic friendship in the same terms . sparked by two superb performances in complex roles , it's as affecting and involving as any tale in which the doomed couple are romantic partners instead of pals . the dynamic between the two central characters works from the outset only because they are so carefully , beautifully drawn by erick zonca and roger bohbot . their playful irreverence makes for some entertaining scenes , and allows the two lead actresses to develop a believable chemistry . that kind of chemistry is critical to a story about a relationship -- if isa and marie don't seem like ideal best friends when they first get acquainted , the rest of the dreamlife of angels becomes utterly irrelevant . it's just as important that the appearance of an ideal pairing proves deceiving , and the film works just as well revealing that truth . the character study of the dreamlife of angels is so strong that it's easier to overlook its short-comings : a drawn-out prologue before the two women meet , under-developed supporting characters , and a third act which takes an unnecessarily melodramatic turn . zonca's minimalist direction never gets in the way of the performances , but it also does little to complement them . in fact , the story might have worked even better as a two-character stage play . that's not to take anything away from the effectiveness of those characters in the film , or the skilled actresses who bring them to life . it's a thoroughly compelling exploration of female bonding and un-bonding , a " chick flick " turned on its head . the disintegration of a friendship has rarely felt quite so tragic . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
trick is one of those rare gay romantic comedies that passes the " straight test . " filmmakers appeared to think that the mere act of putting a same-sex couple on the screen made the film praise-worthy , often failing to introduce much that was entertaining on its own merits . thus was born my " straight test , " which allowed for a fairly quick barometer of quality : would anyone pay the slightest attention to the same story if the two principal characters were a man and a woman ? jim fall's bright , fun , frisky comedy not only passes the " straight test , " it makes plenty of straight romantic comedies look positively inept by comparison . as the evening progresses , and gabriel and mark get better acquainted , simple sex begins to seem less interesting -- though also less complicated -- than the prospect of a more serious relationship . trick's single-day structure may be something of a trick in itself , yet there's rarely a moment when jason schafer's screenplay feels forced or contrived . sure , it falls back on humor from drag queens and cabaret performances . in fact , as pure comedy , trick rarely stumbles . every character gets wonderful moments , sparked by the kind of dialogue woody allen used to produce in his prime . even tori spelling -- yes , i said tori spelling -- is a revelation as the blissfully self-absorbed katherine , particularly throwing her " talents " behind a performance of gabriel's composition " enter you . " when a director can turn spelling into a gifted comic actress , you know he's a talent to watch for . i suppose the reason trick is even more appealing than its laugh value is that it does more with a gay relationship than any film i can remember . that's probably because it isn't _just_ about a gay relationship . the developing relationshp between gabriel and mark works the way all good romantic relationships work , exploring the way people discover surprisingly wonderful things about each other when they least expect it . the fact that the relationship develops in the midst of such entertaining comedy is a delightful bonus . the obstacles thrown in their way do begin to feel a bit contrived , but you may be having too much fun to notice . trick is so effortlessly charming , i may just change the name of the " straight test " to the " trick test .

director/screenwriter : steven zaillian . searching for bobby fischer is the kind of film that can easily get lost in the glut of summer releases . it boasts no superstars , includes no gunfire or velociraptors , and has as its focal point the game of chess . let me repeat that : a movie . . . about chess . no , let me amend that : a wonderful movie about chess . searching for bobby fischer is an emotionally satisfying and surprisingly understated film that takes the tried-and-true formula of such crowd pleasers as rocky and the karate kid and adds some welcome thematic depth . pandolfini is also a purist who shuns the strategies of speed players like vinnie , and wants to instill in josh the calculated single-mindedness and contempt for opponents that characterized fischer's play . this examination of the win-at-all-costs ethos of competition provides one of the film's most potent thematic touchstones . he's better at this than i've ever been at anything in my life . " mantegna's performance is rich and effective , and only one of many super acting turns . kingsley deftly handles the cold , slightly embittered pandolfini , allowing him to be unlikeable but understandable . with his hair hanging just above his eyes and his mouth perpetually in something just less than a smile , first-time actor pomeranc projects josh's earnestness and ever-present tension in sighs and eye movements . it's a delightful performance , made even more surprising by the fact that he is being handled by a first-time director . that director is steven zaillian ( oscar nominated as a screenwriter for awakenings ) , and it's a remarkably confident debut . he delivers the chess scenes with tremendous energy , a challenge if ever there was one . he frames his scenes with a sense of purpose , and his actors are always focused . without a single word of dialogue , zaillian conveys a change in focus for josh , and the beginning of his new life . if there is one place to find fault , it's with the emotional string-pulling that's common to the " competition " genre . james horner's overwrought score practically screams , " cry now ! " in a manner i had thought only john williams had mastered . the climax manages to avoid cliches , however , and i have to admit that i was grinning and on the edge of my seat along with a couple hundred fellow moviegoers . both as intelligent cinema and rousing entertainment , searching for bobby fischer is a winner not to be overlooked . chess . . . on the renshaw scale of 0 points . 
starring : daniel day-lewis , michelle pfeiffer , winona ryder . screenplay : jay cocks and martin scorsese . director : martin scorsese . viewers of the age of innocence will likely fall into one of two camps : those who consider it a minor masterpiece , and those who consider it a huge bore . there is something to be said for both sides . director martin scorsese has crafted a sumptuous and dazzling visual feast from edith wharton's novel of social propriety and repressed desire , but one that suffers from an overlong second act and a lack of character depth . while still an exceptional film experience , it is ultimately one which i found much more engaging intellectually than emotionally . the age of innocence is a tale of surfaces , of a society concerned with the appearance of things rather than the reality . scorsese captures this obsession with surfaces by letting his camera dwell on things rather than people ; calling cards , watch fobs , earrings and table settings all become icons of status and civility . it's a fascinating anthropological study , highlighted by typically bravura scorsese moments , including a piercingly insightful tour through one house during a formal ball . yet for all its virtuosity , i found the age of innocence working essentially as a documentary , not the forbidden love story which is at its core . scorsese is so good at establishing the framework , that he has little time left for the characters . they are kept at a distance , which may in part be the point but left me a bit cold . the performers are not to be held responsible for these shortcomings . he carries himself as though he is constantly on the brink of exploding but knows that it is impossible to do so . miriam margolyes is delightful as may's eccentric and knowing granny mingott , but the rest of the cast is forced to do what it can with roles which essentially function as archer's obstacles ; they are not really characters in their own right . however , the film's technical credits alone make it required viewing . longtime scorsese collaborator thelma schoonmaker does a glorious editing job , and even gets her name on a billboard in the film . cinematographer michael ballhaus takes some stunning and instantly memorable shots , including an ocean panorama which looks like a painting . elmer bernstein's score is lush and evocative , and the costume and production design are certain oscar nominees . the age of innocence demonstrates yet again that martin scorsese could direct " dick and jane " into a visual spectacle . it's a fascinating examination of lifeless and soulless time , and my attention never waned . but i kept finding myself oddly detached , wanting to care more about whether or not archer and ellen would find happiness together but never quite able to do so . there is so much to admire about the age of innocence that it seems like nitpicking , but i'm funny that way : i want to be caught up in love stories . 
screenplay : aaron sorkin and scott frank . director : harold becker . it has long been my belief that the best movie mysteries are those after which you can say to yourself , " i should have figured that out . " i loathe joe eszterhas-style thrillers which make me feel as though i've been had ; nothing that can change the " whodunnit " by shooting five new minutes of footage is constructed tightly enough . almost equally annoying are those which seem to twist and turn just for the sake of twisting and turning , forcing you to engage in a two-hour discussion with your fellow moviegoers just to figure out what the heck you just saw . malice avoids all these pitfalls . this is a sharp , artfully-constructed thriller , a snappy entertainment that does everything i ask a film in its genre to do : keep me guessing without manipulating me . this is the point where reviewing a film like malice gets tricky . comment on the plot is next to impossible , particularly on those few points where i felt credibility is stretched . all i can really say is that the script by aaron sorkin ( a few good men ) and scott frank ( dead again ) is intelligent and impressive in its plausible intricacy . there is an ingenious red herring crafted into the story which successfully diverts attention from other key elements . there were moments when i sensed the entire audience realizing the same thing at the same time . i saw very little of that telltale sign of a confusing mystery : people leaning over to friends and spouses to ask what just happened . every explanation was clear and smooth , if not always perfectly believable . if there's one problem with the plot-heavy script , it's that certain character developments are shallow . bill pullman is very good as the pleasant everyman with a streak of jealousy , but his character would have benefited from some early evidence to make his later behavior more believable . i found bebe neuwirth basically annoying as a police detective sporting an accent that appeared to be a mutant hybrid of boston brahmin and brooklyn italian . baldwin should stick to roles such as this which require colossal displays of hubris . director harold becker showed his talent for atmospheric suspense in sea of love , and surpasses that effort with malice . while never spectacularly tense , malice is always gripping , thanks to a methodical unfolding of the story with something important happening in almost every scene . becker even cleverly undercuts genre expectations , particularly in an ominously underscored shot of a big dark house . . . the audience was in hysterics . this is a smart , deft directing job , and one that establishes becker as a name to watch for . i think i can get away with saying that you shouldn't go into malice expecting a scream-out-loud suspense film . it's more subtle than that , but never less than thoroughly intriguing . this is a mystery for mystery lovers . 
running time : 179 minutes . at one pivotal point in magnolia -- one of several pivotal points in paul thomas anderson's epic of human connection and disconnection -- a woman sits alone in her apartment , singing along to a song . he does this half a dozen more times , capturing every one of his principal characters accompanying the haunting original aimee mann composition " wise up . " that sequence in magnolia is one of the year's best pieces of film-making , and i could name a dozen more moments from the film that will be sticking in my memory . if anderson had pulled all those pieces of film-making together into a stronger whole , magnolia might have been the year's best film , instead of just a very good one . it's certainly an ambitious work , following many characters through one rainy day in the san fernando valley . in a way , the whole thing is little more than an extended attempt to justify the film's most surreal device ( more on which later ) . it's also undeniably compelling , charged by anderson's kitchen sink visual style . and for three hours , that's what magnolia does : it delivers thrilling scene after thrilling scene which , by all rights , should simply feel self-indulgent . when anderson nails these characters at their most vulnerable and conflicted , he creates sensational scenes for actors . magnolia plays like a cross between a symphony and a jazz jam , with solo showcases building toward splendidly edited crescendos . the only thing missing is an anchor , something that ties anderson's multiple story lines together in a way that makes them greater than the sum of their parts . and yes , sins of the fathers play a role in most of the characters' lives . it's obvious anderson wants us to feel a connection . i just don't think he pulls it off , giving more attention to the individual trespasses and recriminations than to the links between them . there's sure to be much talk about anderson's most audacious attempt to pull his story together , a cloudburst in which something besides rain falls from the sky in a torrent . i'm not about to guess what anderson was thinking by loosing a biblical plague upon the san fernando valley , nor will i pretend the credulity-stretching trick doesn't feel more like a grand gag than a dramatic fulcrum . there's also something about it that just plain works -- maybe just as damn-the-torpedoes film-making , maybe as acknowledgement of how primal forces can throttle you into re-evaluating your life . that , in a nutshell , is the wonderful frustration of magnolia . part of you wants to expose anderson as a philosophical poseur , and the other half can't stop watching everything he throws at the screen . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
and that's the good news . this is the first directorial effort by peter mccarthy , producer of such films as repo man and tapeheads , and those credits should tell you all you need to know about the style and tone of floundering . it's a hilariously surreal examination of urban paranoia and hopelessness , filled with oddball characters , goofy stream-of-consciousness narrative and instantly quotable lines . floundering is told through a voiceover narration by john , but it's not so much about john as it is about the chaotic world around him . john is only the tour guide , but his observations are wonderfully off-the-wall : on the destruction in south central l . a . : " maybe we should leave it as a reminder . . . then [peter] ueberroth will turn it into a riot theme park . " on romance : " true love is the ultimate fiction . . . if mccarthy's script is rich with such moments . unfortunately , it's also rich with heavy-handed left-wing moralizing which could easily turn off those with differing points of view . it's therefore very fortunate that so many of the other minor roles are so funny . the snapshots taken by his mental camera provide a bitingly satirical collage of urban life , but surprisingly mccarthy doesn't opt for utter cynicism . instead , he manages to balance black-humored sarcasm and social commentary with an ultimately optimistic message of personal responsibility . for those who enjoy their comedy with an edge and don't mind the occasional preaching , there's a real winner to be found in floundering . besides , how can you not love a film that ends with two guitarists , one black and one white , singing a marvelously off-key duet of " ( what's so funny 'bout ) peace , love and understanding ? " 
screenplay : scott alexander and larry karaszewski . director : milos forman . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , brief nudity , adult themes ) running time : 118 minutes . in the first moments of man on the moon's splendidly inventive prologue , jim carrey says , " hello . . . i am andy . " there is no way to describe carrey's performance as andy kaufman in milos forman's bio-pic except to say that carrey inhabits kaufman . carrey's work may be the best , most effective extended impression in film history . the astonishing thing about man on the moon is how entertaining it is despite the fact that there's very little to it but carrey's extended impression . there's just the small matter of kaufman's insistence on pushing himself , his act and his audience farther than they've ever gone before . hard to take , perhaps , but impossible to ignore . it's also impossible to deny that man on the moon owes most of its entertainment value to kaufman himself , since the film's biggest laughts come from re-creations of kaufman's outrageous performances . kaufman responds with a reading in its entirety of _the great gatsby_ . watching carrey-as-kaufman reach for the edges without anything resembling a net is exhilarating . kaufman's routines still have the ability to inspire gasping laughter . the script by scott alexander and larry karaszewski casts a similar rosy glow over its subject as their scripts for ed wood and the people vs . larry flynt , making the film more of an homage to driven eccentricity than piercing character study . it may be true , as kaufman's girlfriend lynne ( courtney love ) says to him in one scene , that " there is no real you , " but that doesn't make the absence of insight any less disapppointing . while man on the moon's performance set pieces are dazzling , in a sense they never end . it's a portrait of an entire life lived as performance art , when you keep hoping for at least a glimpse behind the curtain . there are moments during the film's final half hour , when kaufman is coping with cancer -- and with the boy-who-cried-wolf repercussions as his friends and family doubt that he is really sick -- that we begin to see a self-aware andy . in one of the film's best moments , a trip to a philippine " psychic surgery " clinic becomes an ironic revelation that attempts to delude others can go too far . with just a few more moments like that , man on the moon might have been a classic film biography . maybe ultimately it's just a showpiece -- for kaufman's decades-ahead-of-his-time genius , and for carrey's dynamic rendering of that genius . maybe it's just a grand illusion without an easily-understood human being behind it . and maybe , in a story about the life of andy kaufman , that's perfectly appropriate . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : robert altman and frank barhydt . director : robert altman . point #1 : raymond carver purists might be extremely disappointed in what robert altman has done to some of the best short stories written in the english language . the interlocking story structure of short cuts does not serve those stories well , and the small pathos of carver's pacific northwest isn't the same in altman's los angeles . point #2 : short cuts stands independently as a splendid film achievement , a brutally funny collection of fragments from broken lives crafted by a director with renewed vitality . only an abiding cynicism and the uneven appeal of the nine main stories mar this dynamic , poetic work . short cuts is about those moments when individuals are at their most basic , naked and vulnerable . indeed , nakedness and scatology play a key role in the film , perhaps more than some viewers might find palatable . characters in short cuts pop zits , break wind , urinate into streams , talk bluntly about sexuality and wander around in various states of undress , but none of these elements ever seem gratuitous . in one of the film's most memorable moments , julianne moore stands before husband matthew modine making a painful confession , with evidence that she is a natural redhead in full view . this is a film loaded with individual moments that slam home with the intensity of reality recognized , and frequently inspire nervous laughter . while the structure serves a purpose in emphasizing a great tapestry of lives , the impact of carver's individual stories is largely lost . it's true that i'm criticizing the film short cuts is not rather than the film it is , but it just seems a shame that such rich source material is given such a cursory treatment . altman never seems to identify with his own characters the way carver did , and as a result it seems he's laughing at them and not with them . opinions will vary as to which stories worked best . at over three hours , short cuts is anything but boring . it's a sharp , clever , perceptive look at life in the big city that goes for the jugular rather than the heartstrings . these short cuts are somewhat cold cuts , but they're mighty tasty . 
if you want big emotions , you want steven spielberg ; if it's understated sentimentality you're looking for , you call tony bill . from 1980's my bodyguard through the recent untamed heart , bill has demonstrated a skill with emotional stories that steer clear of maudlin excess . as one who enjoys feeling without feeling manipulated , i find that a pretty neat trick . a home of our own is an extremely appealing low-key family drama , driven by kathy bates' rock-solid lead performance , which adds to bill's growing resume of restrained character pieces . a home of our own plays a lot like an impoverished " wonder years , " with its 1960s setting and wry retrospective narration , but unlike that series the voice-over is rarely intrusive and doesn't draw the focus away from frances . bates is near perfect , a presence that commands respect ; one is hard-pressed to think of another actor who would be as convincing as a sane mother of six . her slightly weathered features convey years of struggle , but she maintains an earthy good humor and a relentless optimism borne of necessity . that kathy bates gives a great performance can't be considered much of a surprise . what is a pleasant surprise is a home of our own's realistic portrayal of family life in hardship . with the exception of edward furlong , the lacey children are played by first-time actors , and they are quite natural . scenes are filled with petty squabbles , but beneath them all is a kind of solidarity which never seems mock-heroic . there is a level of love and mutual respect in the interaction which frankly threw me . it's not often that a movie does an american family this kind of justice . like most of tony bill's work , a home of our own is best when it's quietly observant . young actors tend to get into a lot of trouble when they're asked to yell , or to deliver lines like , " you care more about the house than you do about us , " and this is no exception . the film also trips when it spends too much time away from kathy bates , such as a tacked-on sequence involving furlong's first date . i was a bit disappointed in the inspirational finale , which loses some of the integrity points that home had accrued . i wish the filmmakers had done less with furlong's character and more with his , the one through whom we can see the family's struggle with somewhat objective eyes . " wholesome " is a word that usually inspires derision , but i couldn't be more complimentary when i say that a home of our own is a wholesome , subtly emotional film , well-acted and skillfully directed . 
starring : kevin costner , clint eastwood , t . j . screenplay : john lee hancock . director : clint eastwood . let's face it , kevin costner hasn't become one of the most popular movie stars in the world because he can act the hell out of a part . sure , he's been charming enough in light fare like silverado and bull durham , but he's done little to prove that his ideal dramatic role wasn't as the corpse in the big chill . it therefore might not seem to mean much to say that a perfect world features costner's best all-around performance yet , and indeed it's nothing earth-shattering . however , it's more than solid , and coupled with an impressive turn by 7-year-old t . j . lowther creates a haunting story that packs a real punch even through its superfluous subplot . it seems in the early stages that he's setting up a parallel , or is interested in creating a hunter-hunted conflict a la the fugitive , but neither reall proves true . instead we get cliche'd characters in cliche'd conflicts . there's an icy fed to get on red's nerves , and plenty of pithy good ol' boy wisdom dispensed . eastwood and dern toss off token lines of good-natured antagonism , but neither one is interesting enough to make their story at all significant . a tighter , potentially classic drama might have come from chopping their segments entirely , because the main plot is a gem . the relationship between butch haynes and philip perry is one of the most unique and interesting explored in recent years . while at first glance butch might seem to be a simple " victim of a negative environment " type , he's more complicated than that . the picture that develops of his father is far from clear , making butch a less than reliable narrator . costner captures a surprising amount of nuance in his portrayal of butch , one minute the doting father , the next an edgy psychotic . it's a radical change of pace for costner , and he pulls it off . perhaps the larger credit for a perfect world's success is t . j . lowther . he's not asked to say much , but his expressive face becomes one of the most vital elements in the film . the relationship between butch and philip is the heart of a perfect world , and it's nearly perfectly executed . director eastwood's first outing since his oscar for unforgiven is a similarly dark piece about a struggle for redemption , and while the whole may not be as strong as last year's best picture winner , some of the moments are even better . the opening sequence is instantly gripping , and a long shot of butch and philip walking through a field , the boy repeatedly attempting to hold the criminal's hand , is wonderful . the best sequence comes near the end , as an idyllic waltz quickly turns into a remarkably intense confrontation . eastwood draws out the ending a bit too long , but by that point i was more than willing to stick with butch and philip . a perfect world is really two films . one is mediocre at best , but the other is one of the best films of the year . together , they still add up to one of the better films of the year . a note to inside joke watchers : look for a billboard for " bull durham tobacco " in the sequence at friendly's store . 
screenplay : roddy doyle . director : stephen frears . television has given the term " situation comedy " a bad name , but that might be the most appropriate epithet for the snapper . there's no high concept , no men in drag or mistaken identities . the snapper is just remarkably adept at making the mundane comic , at making us laugh at real life . thanks largely to colm meaney's charming lead performance , it's just one of the most purely enjoyable comedies of 1993 . with such a simple premise , execution becomes paramount , and the snapper is very well-executed . director stephen frears ( dangerous liaisons , hero ) keeps the comedy human by concentrating on faces and reactions , a technique used most effectively during pub scenes where extreme close-ups of drunken individuals emphasizes distorted perceptions . these are loud and boisterous characters ( a bit excessively so in the case of sharon's cackling clique ) , and frears allows this liveliness to permeate the film . without resorting to location cityscapes , frears creates a rich atmosphere peopled with sparkling characters . the standout among those characters is colm meaney's dessie . dessie is a unique creation , a loving father and husband who avoids the slew of cliches typical of irish characters and father characters in general . meaney is perfect , playing a more nuanced version of the same character he played in the commitments . his moments with sharon are wonderfully warm , even through his frustration at the embarrassment her condition has caused him ; particularly good is a brief , low-key scene as dessie shares with sharon his amazement at the contents of a book on sexuality . it's a performance unlikely to garner much attention for award nominations , but its as deserving of honors as any work out there . the rest of the cast is a bit more uneven . even more so is fionnuala murphy as sharon's best friend jackie . pat laffan's george burgess is a small role , but he does quite a lot with it , making george a rather pathetic figure . generally , the snapper is better when it's not in the pub , and the volume knob on the characters is turned down . some viewers may be made uncomfortable by the circumstances surrounding sharon's sexual encounter , but i found the story depended on those circumstances , and that sharon's response to her situation defined her character . the snapper doesn't moralize , it just sets up a scenario and lets characters react . i found those reactions extremely funny , although i needed to break out my irish- to-american profanity dictionary on more than one occasion . you'll need to play close attention to pick up all the dialogue in the snapper , but it will be well worth the effort . 
starring : juliette binoche , benoit regent , charlotte very . screenplay : krzysztof kieslowski & krzysztof piesiewicz . i can't claim that my experience with french films has been all that extensive , but the limited experience i have had has lent itself to the following stereotypical image : two characters sitting in a dimly lit cafe , smoking cigarettes and speaking cryptically to one another in extremely muted tones . these films tended to deal with emotionally stunted people in an emotionally stunted manner , potentially intriguing but inert , if not downright soporific . it caused me no end of amusement to find a scene exactly like the one i just described in krzysztof kieslowski's three colors : blue . it caused me more pleasure to discover that scene only one part of a complex and fascinating character study of grief , directed with a mesmerizing grace . so now i wonder . . . is it french cinema that has changed , or is it me ? from a narrative standpoint , blue is not the most easily accessible of films . there is very little dialogure , in fact very little sound of any kind ; even the car crash is notable for its understatement . only the occasional explosions of zbigniew preisner's score tend to break the silence , loading the music with significance . kieslowski chooses to allow us into julie's world almost entirely through images , but how arresting those images are . it's a confident but rarely showy directing job by kieslowski , allowing julie's story to unfold slowly and clearly . the centerpiece of blue is the performance of juliette binoche as julie , and it's a winner . while not the type of performance american film audiences are used to seeing , it is nonetheless extremely effective . at times the role might appear one-note , yet there are deeper shadings . binoche proves herself as deserving as any actor this year of oscar consideration . where blue is likely to irritate many is in the deliberate opaquity of some of its images . blue proves to be very slow going at times , and requires immense patience . however , as details concerning the relationship between julie and patrice unfold , such patience will be proved worthwhile . three colors : blue is an intensely focused examination of one woman's attempt at self-deception for her own perceived good , and will likely stick with me for some time . 
screenplay/director : mike leigh . i can thoroughly understand someone either loving or loathing mike leigh's naked . on the one hand , it is a rather unpleasant visceral experience with troubling images of violence against women ; on the other hand , it is unflinching in its acidic humor and features a tour-de-force performance by david thewlis . yet for my money , there is another level at which naked approaches brilliance . this film is a warning designed for the self rather than for society , a startling examination of one mind's response to dehumanization . with johnny , mike leigh has created a magnificent character who serves as a prophet of the apocalypse , an apocalypse he describes in terms rather different from what one might expect . and on and on , too many instances to mention , all connected to johnny's larger obsession with evolution . the title of the film itself becomes an acknowledgement of our status in the universe : when all the frills are stripped away , we're just big monkeys , monkeys who seem to have stopped reaching for more . all the brilliance in the world in the writing would have counted for little withough a perfect actor for johnny , and david thewlis is that actor . his sarcastic , often bilious musings easily could have come off as smug and self-congratulatory , but thewlis pours a great deal of emotion into his lines . yes , he believes that he is more aware than those around him , but he derives no pleasure from that knowledge , instead finding only disgust with it . thewlis is supported by several other fine performances , most notable claire skinner's small but memorable role as the frantic sondra ; only cruttwell rings false with his slimy sebastian . naked is not without its faults . an encounter between johnny and a young scots couple who can't seem to find one another is funny , but doesn't really connect to the rest of the film . the sebastian character is way too much , too crudely drawn to work as the representation of gilded brutishness he is meant to be . naked has a semblance of a narrative through-line , but basically it's a collection of snapshots viewed through johnny's singular lens , and that collection can appear somewhat unfocused . but from its first jarring frames to its final shot of johnny limping down a london street , it risks showing us the side of ourselves we don't like to see , and hoping we won't turn away . 
director : mary harron . mpaa rating : r ( violence , sexual situations , nudity , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 97 minutes . i've never read the bret easton ellis novel on which american psycho is based , so i don't know whether its reputation as literary garbage is warranted . that could easily make for a very tedious , dehumanizing read , so i can understand why potential viewers might be skeptical about a film version of this much-reviled book . after all , what could possibly be entertaining about watching a sociopath spend an hour and a half obsessing over colognes and suits between capital crimes ? harron's telling of the tale mixes 1980s nostalgia with pitch-black humor , anchored by christian bale's riveting performance . the heartless , soulless heart and soul of american psycho is bale's brilliant performance as bateman . bad for leo ; good for us . bale plays bateman with an exaggeration that's sure to be misconstrued as hamming it up . bale's work is also brutally funny , most notably in scenes where he engages in rambling deconstructions of some of the decade's most banal music ( huey lewis' " hip to be square ; " genesis' " in too deep " ) . if this performance doesn't prove to be one of the year's best , we're in for a very good year indeed . there is , of course , also the matter of the much-talked-about sex and violence , which cost the version screened at the sundance film festival a few seconds of excised gyrating . naturally the content will make american psycho a film for very specific tastes , but viewers should be clear that this isn't primarily a thriller we're talking about . yes , there are suspense elements , and there are a few grisly deaths ( most taking place out of the frame ) , and there are some moments of moderately explicit naughtiness . all of those elements should also be viewed in context . how anyone could view bateman's narcissistic orgy as pornographic ( or even eroitic ) is beyond me ; how the film could be perceived as a commercial for unbridled appetites and surrender to the id is baffling . there's no point pretending american psycho has anything radically new , profound or insightful to say about its era . satirical critiques of yuppie materialism have already become somewhat trite a decade later , and it's clear from minute one that the film is about turning the figurative ability to get away with murder into the literal equivalent . that doesn't make many of american psycho's finer moments any less effective , from the shallow one-liners ( " i'm not really hungry , but i want to have a reservation somewhere " ) to the hysterical scene in which characters define their pecking order by the quality of their business cards . the third act does begin to drag , and the hallucinatory closing scenes are bound to leave some viewers scratching their heads . but american psycho gets creepier , funnier and more insinuating the longer i think about it . source material be damned : even if ellis' american psycho is junk , it provided the framework for something savagely entertaining . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
i'm no marketing whiz , but it would appear that someone made a serious error in the advertising campaign for the new australian import sirens . one might be inclined to believe that the target audience is men , and that sirens is simply some soft-core porn throwaway . in fact , sirens has more in common with enchanted april than it does with emmanuelle . writer/director john duigan , creator of the wonderful coming-of-age films the year my voice broke and flirting , has fashioned another tale of sexual awakening , this time focusing on an adult , and it's a delightfully acted and beautifully filmed comedy-drama . sirens skillfully interweaves two themes without seeming overstuffed . that world is populated by wombats , insects and even flowers which take on a kind of personality . the characters native to this world are frequently shown eating apples , practically wallowing in their connection to original sin . lindsay challenges the christian notion of sin as linked to female sexuality , and sirens is largely the playing out of that challenge . at the same time , the issue of artistic censorship is very much part of the subtext . he presents the church's case with a respect for its views , and hugh grant is a charming and surprisingly hip spokesman . while the arguments are nothing special , and in fact tend towards the cliche , duigan treats the issue of art , its influence on the public and the artist's responsibility as a legitimate subject of debate . if there is any fault to be found with duigan's script , it's that he does skimp on his characters in the interest of establishing his analogy . the relationship between anthony and estella is not as well-established as it might be , and lindsay himself is little more than a catalyst for estella's transformation . macpherson and fischer look good , but they're given too much to say and it's never all that interesting when they do speak . however , sirens does quite a lot with its visuals , highlighting its glorious australian settings , and it maintains a frisky sense of humor about its sensual subject matter without sniggering over it . those who might be looking for a leering sex romp should look elsewhere ; sirens is lyrical , lively and thoughtful and always a feast for the senses . 
mpaa rating : r ( profanity , nudity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 108 minutes . there were cries of outrage from adults who just didn't understand the rebellious messages of this new musical form , accompanied by the certain knowledge that civilization as we knew it was about to come to an end . and finally , there was the inevitable transformation of rebellion and singularity into its own kind of conformity . anyone at all familiar with the pistols would hope to high heaven that a film-maker wouldn't choose to tell their story in the measured tones of hero worship . julien temple has already documented the sex pistols in 1980's the great rock 'n' roll swindle , so there was the danger that the filth and the fury would feel not just like a canonization of a pioneering band , but a recycled canonization . instead , temple captures not just the energy of the pistols , but their satirical sense of playfulness as well . with music , animation and dozens of archival clips , temple compiles a film that doesn't merely lay out a sex pistols chronology ; it captures the atmosphere and the attitude of anarchy in the u . k . that's not to say that it's instantly reliable as the definitive sex pistols story . swindle may have been an obvious attempt at self-congratulation by mclaren , but the filth and the fury occasionally seems just as much like an ego piece for johnny rotten . rotten may very well be a more reliable historian of the pistols than mclaren , but when he and jones relate differing accounts of a hotel room snafu , it's hard not to here rotten's version as a bit of overdramatization . make no mistake , it's still tremendously interesting listening to rotten's perspective on the rise and fall of the band . that's actually a fairly minor quibble with a film as vital and generally unpretentious as the filth and the fury ( you don't get less pretentious than steve jones' crudely honest reason for wanting to be in a band ) . of course , he probably would be less concerned with the philosophizing than pure sensory jolt , and that's something the filth and the fury provides . it took the sex pistols two years to distill rock and roll into every one of its basic elements . it takes julien temple 108 minutes to do the same thing to the sex pistols . it's a story with the frantic , two-and-a-half-minute raw energy blast of a classic punk anthem . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : rafael azcona , from a story by azcona , jose luis garcia sanchez & fernando trueba . director : fernando trueba . it was considered something of an upset when the academy award for foreign language film went to spain's belle epoque , but in retrospect it really shouldn't have been . belle epoque bears more than a passing resemblance to that former winner ; it's a sunny , sensual comedy with all the makings of a crossover success . although it features no real story to speak of , and some clownish characters , its frisky tone and clever direction by fernando trueba make it a worthwhile experience . comedy is probably the hardest cinematic genre to translate from foreign language films , so it is high praise indeed to note that belle epoque had the audience where i saw the film laughing hard and often . the subtitling is superb , losing only minor idioms in the translation . those more familiar with spanish history and culture might be quicker to figure out what a " carlist " is , or the humor behind the parish priest's affinity for philosopher miguel de unamuno , but far more of the fun in belle epoque transcends particulars of culture . there are delightful moments of physical comedy , most notably violeta's gender-bending seduction of fernando while both are in costume at a carnival . the humor is almost entirely accessible , and it's very winning . much of belle epoque's earthy charm comes from the slightly anachronistic " if-it-feels-good-do-it " attitude of many of the principal characters . however , belle epoque makes no pretense to being " about " anything , and it is in that respect that the film commits its few errors . there is really no plot , just a series of amusing encounters which don't serve to develop any of the characters . the characterizations are somewhat weak , particularly that of fernando , whose seminarian background , professed agnosticism and unabashed romanticism are never successfully linked . clara , luz and rocio are too sketchy , and juanito is simply a buffoon . there are two strong performances , from ariadna gil as violeta and fernando fernan gomez as manolo , and it is no coincidence that they are also the most fully developed characters . still , belle epoque does what trueba intends for it to do , which is to entertain and amuse . it may not have been my choice for an oscar , but there could have been far worse choices . 
it's a terrible habit of mine that i often find myself watching non-english language films throught he lens of " how would hollywood screw this up . " aside from the implied inherent superiority of all things sub-titled , there's the strange problem of comparing a film i'm watching to a film that hasn't even been made , but which in my head is a dire experience indeed . a film can't help but seem glorious under such conditions , though it doesn't help the discussion of the film on its own merits . i was doing a pretty good job of avoiding the hypothetical comparison in zhang yimou's not one less , until a curious thing happened : in its final fifteen minutes , it started to turn into its own hollywood incarnation . thank heaven it's so good for so long that the strange twist can't spoil the experience . the impressive thing about both zhang's direction and shi xiangsheng's script ( based on his account of his experience as a rural teacher ) is how gradually and unobtrusively wei's character develops . she's pretty unsympathetic at the outset -- utterly unqualified for her post , effective primarily at playing goalkeeper at the schoolroom door , but not at all troubled about demanding her money . the cleverly handled scenes of wei leading the class in math problems with very real-world implications make for a solid foundation , but it's only when wei heads into the city that her quest becomes more selfless . wei's quest and the growing she does along the way make for a thoroughly compelling narrative , but zhang has socio-political fish to fry as well . it's still a satisfying resolution , but it's excessively underlined . it's the way hollywood films too often try to convince an audience they've not just watched an enjoyable film , but also become more compassionate , better-informed citizens of the world . the frustrating part is that it's so unnecessary . virtually from the outset , the financial conditions of the school become an effective part of the drama ; you'd never expect a film to wring such tension from a student stepping on the school's more-precious-than-gold chalk supply . the rookie actors are raw , but do a more than serviceable job of performing their own lives . in short , not one less does everything a film needs to do to draw you into its world , and into the characters inhabiting that world . when it resorts to a message-heavy happy ending , it suddenly feels like another sort of film entirely . for a thankfully brief moment , i saw a glimpse of the mass-market crowd-pleaser that might have been . it's a reminder of how much more pleasing a film can be when it sticks to simpler truths . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
let's compare the cinematic bards of baltimore for a moment . if i'm guessing , i'd say that the chamber of commerce might lean towards levinson . however , when putting their latest films head to head , i think my choice is obvious . a lot of people . waters manages to comment on so many different aspects of contemporary society that it's hard to believe he intended them all . without hand-wringing , waters points out our complicity in such crimes through our fascination with them . his one stumble into heavy-handedness comes when chip's girlfriend reacts to the difference between real blood and movie blood , but basically waters keeps the tone light with his cartoonish style . social commentary aside , serial mom is just plain funny . the opening is a bit slow , but serial mom finishes with high energy . turner has suffered through so many bad films in recent years that it is a pleasure to see her with something she can sink her teeth into . her smiling amalgam of donna reed and hannibal lecter is frequently campy , but always appealing , creating another level of identification which implicates the audience . it's true that the characters in serial mom are one-dimensional , but that's almost appropriate given the film's framework as a " true-crime " re-enactment of the real events . serial mom is fun with an edge , and it killed me . 
director : robinson devor . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 90 minutes . pulp-noir is tough to pull off in this era of self-referential hipness . strangely enough , pulp-noir satire may be even tougher to pull off , since the entire genre itself fairly reeks of self-parody every time a hard-boiled guy , a hard-boiled situation and hard-boiled voice-over dialogue combine on screen . now take that pulp-noir satire and base it on a real pulp novel , and you've got the potential for a smug disaster . it _couldn't_ work . writer/director robinson devor had the recipe for yet another inert genre parody in his hands , but somehow he turned it into something so wonderfully warped it's almost impossible to resist . but he could be in for hard lessons about " the biz . " if the above summary sets you to puzzling over the film's title , fear not . in the 1950s and 1960s , willeford wrote within a genre where publishers couldn't care less what was inside the cover , so long as a broad in a tight sweater and a provocative title were on the cover . robinson devor uses willeford's own off-beat sensibility as a launching pad , then turns the woman chaser into such a twisted combination of subversion and homage that you can only ride along where it takes you . devor nails the genre atmosphere , helped greatly by kramer morgenthau's marvelous black-and-white a la kiss me deadly cinematography and warburton's note-perfect narration . parody only seems to work when it's inspired by genuine affection , and devor clearly loves film noir , mannered conventions and all . he also figures out that his story is a way to give a fresh twist to the trite independent film premise of making an independent film . from richard's intense pitch of his film's concept , to his unconventional methods of eliciting performances , to his obsession with the perfect edited length of his film , the woman chaser finds a kick for every predictable situation . taking the concept out of the present day film-making world gives it the perfect touch of the surreal , without even the faintest hint of the superior outsider attitude that too often hinders movies about making movies . there are ebbs in devor's pacing , and a narrative that doesn't always hang together except as a showcase for warburton's tremendously entertaining performance . yet even then there's entertainment value in virtually every aborted narrative thread . it's too easy to praise a film simply for being different , but the woman chaser is different in all the right ways . it's energetic and imaginative where other parodies are too often limp and witless . it skewers the ego of film-makers , but never loses its love for film-making . it even pokes fun at film noir without resorting to predictable gags . the woman chaser is a surprise in every positive sense of the word , because really , it shouldn't work . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : david hayter . producers : lauren shuler donner and ralph winter . director : bryan singer . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 100 minutes . i think it's fair to say that i've been looking forward to a film version of x-men for a while now -- somewhere in the neighborhood of 23 years , as a matter of fact . x-men #107 was one of the first comic books i ever bought , and it launched me on a love affair with the medium that abated only when , as a college student , i could no longer afford my habit . some readers may suspect that this history would lead me to go easy on an adolescent fan-boy . personally , i thought it would make me much tougher . after all , a 23-year wait can do something to one's expectations . i didn't think i'd settle for anything less than the kind of comic book adaptation you almost never see : one that combines rousing heroic action with a solid story . to my joy and astonishment , that's exactly what i got . x-men is not just a great comic book movie ; it's actually a pretty good movie _period_ . for those unfamiliar with the source material , the x-men are mutants -- humans with unusual powers that manifest themselves during puberty . that choice not only gives the story an emotional anchor , it gives plenty of screen time to x-men's most intriguing character and easily its best performance . you've probably never seen australian actor hugh jackman before -- though he resembles a brawnier gary sinise -- but you will see him again , because the guy has charisma to burn . jackman offers everything a fan could hope for in a portrayal of wolverine , from the trademark muttonchops to the genuine sense of mystery and menace . if x-men had nothing else going for it but jackman , it would still be worth seeing . the wonderful thing is that x-men _does_ have more going for it . it offers dozens of insider gags for the x-men faithful , while avoiding the slavish devotion to every detail that can interfere in solid film story-telling . and , just in case it matters to anyone , it offers some of the kick-ass-in'-est action scenes this side of the matrix . the fact that you don't have to wade through 90 minutes of junk to get to it is a wonderful bonus . of course x-men has its flaws . there's not much for halle berry to do but look intense when her eyes go white , which is probably all for the best given the incredible disappearing accent she occasionally employs . the script also doesn't do quite enough with turning magneto into a genuinely tragic villain , especially given the amount of time devoted to his back-story in the prologue . it's always tough for a film like x-men to lay the foundation while still delivering the goods , so it's inevitable that there are going to be some lulls and loose ends . i was startled , however , by how few there were . maybe my inner adolescent fan-boy did emerge during x-men , but it emerged because the film reminded me of the best the comic book had to offer , as well as some of the best an action film can offer . i think it was worth the wait , though i have a sneaking suspicion it won't be 23 years before the x-men hit the screen again . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : robert king . director : mick jackson . when i stepped into the theater to see clean slate , i had yet to see any evidence that dana carvey might actually be capable of acting . in fact , he seemed incapable of anything but the broadest schtick . his " saturday night live " characters were usually caricatures , and the wayne's world films and the horrible opportunity knocks simply regurgitated those characters . so it qualifies as one of the most unexpected surprises of the year that clean slate turns out to be an absolutely delightful comedy . as improbable as the concept might seem , director mick jackson ( the bodyguard ) reins in carvey's tendency towards excess and gives him a real character to work with , and the chance to generate big laughs . clean slate is so full of unpredictable pleasures that it's difficult to know where to begin . the greatest is probably the performance of carvey , in a role analagous in many ways to bill murray's in groundhog day . the nature of pogue's condition inevitably limits his character development , but merely watching carvey react to that situation is endlessly entertaining . but there is virtually nothing about clean slate which isn't quirky , off-handed and charming . director jackson complements the weirdness with visual throwaways like the neck brace james earl jones' character wears with a hole for his tie to come through , and the band-aid carvey sports through out the film . clean slate is that rare comedy which simply never goes exactly where you expect it to go . all this would be quite enough to recommend clean slate , but it also provides a neatly-polotted little mystery . occasionally it feels as though king and jackson are trying to throw in a bit too much ( the character of pogue's ex-wife is particularly unnecessary ) , which sidetracks the film's energy . however , at the end of clean slate i was left without a single plausibility problem . in the 24 hours since i saw clean slate , bits and pieces have popped into my head constantly , prompting spontaneous laughter , and it just keeps growing on me . it wouldn't be surprising , given carvey's track record and an advertising campaign which can't do it justice , to see clean slate make a quick exit from theaters . then again , there might just be one more surprise coming . 
screenplay : elizabeth cuthrell , david urrutia and oren moverman , based on the book by denis johnson . director : alison maclean . jesus' son is a film about addiction -- only it's not , really . the way we're used to seeing films about addiction , there's a message , a lesson , an agenda . drugs are bad , the effects of drugs on users and their immediate circle of acquaintances are worse , and our hero would be a perfectly happy and productive member of society if not for that thing he wouldn't just say no to . these tend to be films in which the ostensible messed-up protagonist isn't really the center of the film . it's the needle that's the center of the film , or the bottle , or the rolled-up $100 bill . addiction isn't just the theme ; it's the star . so let's re-phrase that introduction : jesus' son is a film about fh ( billy crudup ) -- short for f * * * head -- a man who eventually becomes an addict . fh narrates his story with all the straight-ahead narrative lucidity you'd expect of a perpetually stoned guy ; he riccochets back and forth in time , picking up one thread of the story in the middle of another story when he recalls something he's forgotten to tell us . director alison maclean and her trio of writers give jesus' son a playfulness that's entertaining even as it never shies away from the darkest sides of addiction . it's a film with the wonderfully scrambled logic of drug use itself . but in case you missed the caveat , this is not exactly a film about addiction . crudup finds a cohesiveness to fh's character through the episodic film , and even manages to keep up with jack black's scene-stealing orderly in the film's most hilarious segments . jesus' son works not because the individual scenes are so effective ( though they are ) or because the portrayal of addiction is so grimly affecting ( because it is not ) , but because fh is a great anchor for a film that heads in so many different directions . perhaps inevitably , jesus' son eventually turns to the subject of fh's attempts to get straight , and it's a bit depressing that the film loses so much steam once drugs are no longer involved . perhaps the come-down is relative after such a wonderful first hour ; perhaps there's nothing for an episodic film to do but find a somewhat arbitrary place to stop . even the sluggish conclusion can't diminish the surprising , darkly comic experience of jesus' son , however . how refreshing to see addiction take a back seat to the addict , to see the needle in its appropriate place as supporting player . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : hugh leonard . director : john irvin . i can't think of a film in the last few years set in ireland that i did not enjoy , and i'm fairly sure it's not coincidence . it's me celtic roots crying out , it is . the verdant hills , the piqued accents , the mystical catholicism . . . all grip me in a way that is difficult to explain . so i warn ye to take my comments regarding widows' peak with a certain grain of salt , even though i believe that you don't need to be a celtophile to find it a wonderfully entertaining comedy-mystery . widows' peak was directed by john irvin , whose previous projects have been primarily action-oriented ( raw deal , hamburger hill ) , and it may be that sensibility which makes this film more than just another pastoral romp . while there is plenty of lovely scenery , there is also a tremendous level of energy , a sassy edge uncommon to films in similar settings . the high spirits are further enhanced by the performances . joan plowright is wonderful as the dowager queen of widows' peak , even if she could play a part like this in her sleep by now . her matter-of- fact confidence that her every whim should be gospel is delightful to watch , as are the subtle ways in which she demonstrates her condescension . in her first post-woody outing , farrow reminds us that she can indeed play something besides a female version of woody allen's neurotic persona . her role here is a tricky one to pull off , balancing several layers of suspicion and deception , but she does pull it off , and with surprising grace . she gets some positively venomous lines , and seems to delight in delivering them . irvin has clearly made her role the showcase , and in one last lingering shot , seems to be saying , " i knew you could do it . " the mystery elements which drive the second half of the film are perhaps a bit too easy to figure out , as irvin and screenwriter hugh leonard underline each of their clues with too much emphasis . but if they are not tremendously surprising , it doesn't seem as though they were really intended to be . this is not a film predicated on some gasp-inducing , crying game-like twist ; rather , the plot twists are just there to allow the character development , befuddling at first , to fall into place . in fact , the only time widows' peak really slows down is when there is lengthy exposition , particularly at a dinner party which is unfortunately handled in a slightly clumsy manner . but with or without the mystery , widows' peak would still have been funny and frisky , filled with nicely detailed cultural moments but mostly just a crisp and fun-filled hour and forty minutes . 
as is probably the case for many of my worldly generation , my defining image of tammy faye bakker isn't even really of tammy faye bakker . it's the image of " saturday night live's " jan hooks doing tammy faye , all squeaky rebuking of demons and freely flowing mascara . tammy faye herself was a caricature , easy to mock because of that heart-on-the-sleeve demeanor and that garishly made-up face on that tiny body . and she was so easy to laugh at . randy barbato and fenton bailey's documentary the eyes of tammy faye is clearly an attempt to rehabilitate tammy faye now-messner's image , made with the full cooperation of the first lady of televangelism . and it's a frequently fascinating character study that puts a truly human face on the much-maligned woman . the eyes of tammy faye is full of the sort of eye-opening tidbits that make a documentary more than a parade of facts , places and dates . there's humor in the clips of a pre-oscar kevin spacey playing jim bakker in a made-for-tv movie , and drama in the machinations of jerry fallwell to force the bakkers out of ptl ( fallwell himself refused to be interviewed for the film ) . all documentaries should be this entertaining . it's also not clear until the film is nearly over that it has spent most of its running time avoiding its most intriguing subject : the present-day tammy faye . the goofy genuineness that emerges in scenes like her reaction to being in a grounded airplane during an electrical storm make for a much more human story than the story of the bakkers' pre-scandal careers . none of that makes the eyes of tammy faye any less worth watching ; in fact , it's almost like two provocative short films effectively fused together . it's also playful ( the babe-esque chorus of sock puppets reading the chapter titles ) , informative and even a little bit inspirational . it's a treat getting to know that plucky survivor , and learning that there's something more than someone else's caricature behind that trademark mascara . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : raymond defelitta . director : raymond defelitta . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 104 minutes . sentimentalized stories of the 1950s have become so commonplace in film that it's incredibly refreshing to find one that doesn't whitewash the darker side of the happy days . raymond defelitta's two family house is in some ways a familiar feel-good story , but it gives its good feeling an unexpected edge . for a while , two family house looks like it might turn into a broad comedy , with the italians and irish clashing loudly and perhaps farcically . in fact , she's scoffing at even more than that , as are buddy's friends in a slightly different way . what is ridiculous to them is the idea of anyone moving too far beyond the proscribed ethnic , cultural and even geographic boundaries . buddy's willingness to extend a hand to mary , just like his desire to pursue a career dream , suggests that the boundaries are a bit blurry . and the idea of blurry boundaries makes everyone around buddy more than slightly uncomfortable . even without its subtext , two family house is a funny , well-acted and tremendously appealing drama -- so appealing that it might even be perceived as fantastically generous to its protagonist . rispoli delivers a nicely nuanced performance as buddy , a teddy bear of a guy trying to move forward rather than look back in bitterness at missed opportunities or failures . it occupies that treacherous middle ground between comedy and drama where a film can either feel too frivolous or not frivolous enough . fortunately , defelitta understands how to make his film about more than its obvious premise without resorting to overly-weighty symbolism . culture clashes tend to be represented on screen either in strident sociology lectures or fish-out-of-water yuk-fests . it's an achievement that's not nearly as simple as it looks . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
starring : rusty cundieff , larry b . scott , mark christopher lawrence , kasi lemmons . screenplay/director : rusty cundieff . film reviewers , myself included , often obsess over originality . everything is derivative , we lament ; everything is recycled . then , periodically , i am reminded that given the choice between an original film and a good one , i would much prefer the latter . fear of a black hat has been referred to as this is spinal rap on more than one occasion , and it is true that there is more than a passing similarity between the two . all right , there is a remarkable similarity . but ultimately , only one thing really matters : fear of a black hat is very , * very * funny , probably the funniest film of the year so far . ( niggaz with hats ) , whose members are rappers ice cold ( rusty cundieff ) and tasty taste ( larry b . scott ) and dj tone def ( mark christopher lawrence ) . in terms of plot structure , it often seems that writer/ director/star rusty cundieff decided simply to " colorize " spinal tap . it is not simply the framing device which is borrowed , but a multitude of specific details : gigs with somewhat insulting billing on the marquis ; internal squabbles triggered by a domineering girlfriend ; tap's series of ill-fated drummers replaced by n . w . h . 's series of ill-fated managers . yet with all these borrowed elements , there are a couple of other things cundieff might have been well-served to duplicate . one is keeping the framing structure consistent . frequently the camera work breaks out of the verite style for shots a single-camera documentary really couldn't be filming . the other is keeping the performances as deadpan as possible . if fear of a black hat tends to stumble , it's when it veers into campiness . even then , there are some huge laughs to be had in black hat . tone def's solo project is a hilarious bit modeled after p . m . but cundieff is perhaps most adept at skewering rap's self-important politics through ice cold's wonderfully improbable explanations of how songs such as " booty juice " actually contain an important social message . even the misogyny in rap culture is nailed perfectly in a single line , perhaps the film's funniest ( be sure to stay through the credits or you'll miss it ) . there are a lot of great details in fear of a black hat ( my favorite being tasty taste's massive bowling-trophy-on-a-chain necklace ) , which makes it frustrating that cundieff often plays up the broader bits . an obligatory scene in which ice cold is pulled over and hassled by a rent-a-cop is dragged out far too long , and a parody of new jack city seems only to serve as a way to take a jab at black filmmakers ( " jike spingleton " is the director ) . still , i laughed harder and more often at fear of a black hat than at any other movie in quite some time . make sure you're in the house when n . w . h . 
starring : jasper salen , stellan skarsgaard , basia frydman , niclas olund . it may be my imagination , but the last two years seem to have been a particularly good time to be a young actor . whether it's representative of some societal yearning for a return to innocence , a rare influx of young talent , or some happy confluence of the two , coming-of-age dramas have become nearly as ubiquitous as hugh grant . none of which makes a good one any less desirable , and the slingshot is a good one indeed , a sharply written swedish import with a singular perspective and exceptional performances . but in spite of his many obstacles , roland navigates through his difficult world with determination and an inventive spirit . as with the other recent films i mentioned , the slingshot rests squarely on the small shoulders of its young star , and jasper salen is up to the task . with a round , open face reminiscent of a christmas story's peter billingsley , salen manages to convey both innocence and toughness in the delicate balancing act required by ake sandgren's adaptation . while many things happen * to * roland , he is never merely a receptacle . roland is always thinking , and it is this intelligence that comes through in salen's performance . although the slingshot is , as one might expect , primarily episodic , it is still rich enough thematically that it never feels like merely a loose collection of scenes . foremost among these themes is the clash of capitalism and socialism , personified by roland himself . when roland shows a cat his newly refurbished bike and says to it , " that's mine , " it is as succinct a statement of rebellion as one might imagine . the slingshot's key failing may be that it tries to do too much , and some of the scenes begin to seem repetitive . the obligatory moment of sexual awakening seems just that--obligatory--and ends with a scene surprisingly lacking in emotional punch . those relationships , particularly roland's complex interaction with his father , are what make the slingshot memorable . thanks to jasper salen's splendid work , the slingshot takes its place as a worthy addition to the list of fine coming-of-age films . 
screenplay : david mamet . director : david mamet . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 106 minutes . george for-the-love-of-it's a wonderful life bailey . yes , indeed , waterford is the quintessence of wholesome small-town america , god bless us every one . somewhere between frank capra and david lynch ( by way of woody allen ) lies the world of david mamet's state and main , a movie industry satire that's not really a movie industry satire in its unique , sweetly cynical way . in a more conventional film , state and main would have turned into a broad fish-out-of-water farce about clashes between the worldly and the homespun . mamet chooses to keep those two worlds largely distinct from a narrative standpoint , juxtaposing the film's behind-the-scenes chaos with the reactions of the townspeople to the crew's presence . most of the more straightforward humor comes from the pre-production , with good self-deprecating work by baldwin and parker and hilarious work by david paymer as the film's cutthroat producer . as both writer and director , mamet keeps masterful control over when information is revealed , adding layers of humor at unexpected moments . in their clockwork construction and delightful aura of self-importance , those movie scenes are the stuff of great comedy . but state and main actually works best as something more than a simple razzing of movie folk . the real object of mamet's ridicule is the whole idea of " purity " over which black obsessess in his script . waterford is no idealized hamlet away from the hustle and bustle of hollywood . mamet takes the myth of pop culture as corruptor of ordinary , decent americans and shows ordinary , decent americans in our tabloid- and wwf-obsessed " average american " world plenty ready to be corrupted if given an excuse , thank you very much . that may sound like a terribly dark perspective , but state and main is actually a bit more optimistic . the budding romance between black and white is not just significant in the metaphorical obviousness of their names , but in showing how tough it is to maintain a moral center in any environment . it's also , unfortunately , a seriously weak link . it's nice to see an actor like hoffman get a shot at a romantic lead , but there's something missing from his character to make him a solid center . and while pidgeon is getting better on screen all the time , she still slips into the most jarring examples of clipped mamet-speak . state and main hits its own giant pothole like the one the town continues to ignore , but unlike in the film , it never gets big enough to cause a wreck . mamet's script is too sharp , the performances too strong , and the message too cleverly insinuated . good comedy is rare ; good comedy with something to say is even rarer . welcome to waterford , a little slice of america the way it used to be -- and the way it really is . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
producers : kevin costner , kevin o'donnell , peter o . almond and armyan bernstein . director : roger donaldson . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 138 minutes . not literal alarm bells for some civil defense drill -- metaphorical , artistic alarm bells for viewers with a sense of deja vu . this is a film about the cuban missile crisis , but here we are with a crew-cut costner in his domestic glory . will thirteen days , like jfk before it , make the mistake of looking at a pivotal moment in american history and asking , " how did it affect kevin costner's fictional family ? " then , for most of the film , something wonderful happens : we see no one but men in suits , trying to solve a seemingly unsolvable problem . as tautly directed by roger donaldson , thirteen days finds riveting drama in passionate debate , tricky politics and impossible decisions -- at least until the o'donnell kin start turning up again . do nothing , and doomsday is a five minutes flight from half of america . thirteen days is a history-based thriller that faces a variation on the knuckle-headed joke promulgated by the anti-titanic contingent : in this case , we know the boat ( or the human race ) _doesn't_ sink . but thirteen days isn't about whether or not the world will be bombed to cinders ; it's about the astonishing real-life war game played by capable but flawed people for the fate of civilization . for a film that is devoted largely to debate and description of scenarios , thirteen day is incredibly tense . we watch politicians go toe-to-toe with soldiers over the appropriate philosophical footing for dealing with the red menace . we watch brinksmanship played like two kids shoving each other on a schoolyard . it's the kind of smart film-making of ideas that can keep you on the edge of your seat waiting for a phone to ring , or not to ring . mostly , however , it's a profile in the courage under fire of john f . kennedy . plenty of films have opted either to canonize jfk as our great slain king or demonize him as a womanizing rich kid , but i don't think any film has ever made him as compelling a dramatic character . costner is a much-maligned dramatic actor , and he doesn't do himself favors here with a honking boston accent that's borderline absurd next to the subtler intonations of greenwood and culp ( as scary a dead ringer for rfk as you could imagine ) . policy can make surprisingly intense cinema , without a breakfast table or report card in sight . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : wang hui-ling , james schamus and tsai kuo-jung , based on the book by wang du-lu . director : ang lee . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( violence , sexual situations ) running time : 120 minutes . before delving into the reasons crouching tiger , hidden dragon isn't the unqualified masterpiece it's been touted as , let's revel in the reasons it's still a cinematic joy in a year of mostly leaden entertainments . in one of the film's many inspiring action sequences , a pair of adversaries square off in battle , employing a mystical fighting technique that allows its adherents to virtually defy gravity . it is the moment when it's easiest to appreciate crouching tiger , hidden dragon as a giddy exercise in pure cinema showmanship . over and over again , it lifts you out of the mundane world of a theater seat . it also drops you back into that seat a bit roughly every once in a while , but why quibble ? as directed by ang lee , the story is both mythologically basic and epic in scope . as solid as the narrative is in many ways , it would be ridiculous to argue that its critical and commercial success will be rooted in the story . crouching tiger , hidden dragon is first and foremost an adventure , one that turns choreographed action into pure film art . the action sequences combine the astonishing talents of fight choreographer yuen wo-ping ( the matrix ) with spectacular wire work to create moments that make you want to stand up and applaud . there's never even a sense of redundancy as the film progresses ; each sequence serves its own purpose , and offers wonderful variations on the clashing of metal , feet and fists , and escapes up sheer walls . it's pure indiana jones fun with an unexpected sense of consequence . it's also a martial arts-heavy film in which the thematic elements actually matter . while crouching tiger is certainly enjoyable as a distaff spin on the usually testosterone-soaked chop-socky genre , it's more than a feminist action flick . for an action-filled film , there's a lot going on above the neck . that's quite a load for an adventure film to carry , and occasionally it's not quite up to the task . yet as ambitious as it is , crouching tiger , hidden dragon never feels self-important . as beautifully crafted as it is ( notably peter pau's cinematography and tan dun's score ) , it never turns into a stagnant parade of lovely images . and as fanciful as its action sequences are , they never inspire eye-rolling . crouching tiger , hidden dragon isn't a masterpiece , but it doesn't have to be . there's pleasure enough in a film that doesn't make you feel stupid while it sends you soaring over the treetops . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
starring : sihung lung , chien-lien wu , kuie-mei yang , yu-wen wang , ah-leh gua , jui wang , winston chao . screenplay : hui-ling wang , james schamus and ang lee . director : ang lee . issues of quality aside , this is the best advice i can give to anyone considering seeing ang lee's eat drink man woman : do * not * see it on an empty stomach . also like that earlier film , it is about much more than recipes . eat drink man woman , like lee's oscar-nominated 1993 film the wedding banquet , is a story of generational conflict , a witty and emotionally involving tale in which food plays a pivotal role in observations on a changing chinese culture . eat drink man woman also explores romantic relationships in this context of generational change , and there it is less consistently successful . each of the four main characters is given a subplot , and like old chu's dinners the film begins to seem like there is a bit too much to consume in one sitting . the youngest daughter's story is particularly weak , and the film might have been more effective if her character had been dropped entirely . otherwise , solid acting makes for some affecting stories . sihung lung , so good as the father in the wedding banquet , is again taciturn without being one-note , and provides a solid anchor for the film . the best story belongs to kuei-mei yang's jia-jen , and she does a magnificent job of playing all of jia-jen's buried emotions at just the right level . i was not a huge fan of the wedding banquet ; i felt it was inconsistently paced , and that its weak lead performances hindered its emotional pull . though it runs a bit long , eat drink man woman is a warm and keenly observed character piece , filled with mostly exceptional performances . see it as it makes its way to your town . 
starring : harrison ford , willem dafoe , joaquim de almeida , henry czerny , donald moffatt , anne archer . screenplay : donald stewart , steven zaillian and john milius . director : phillip noyce . pyrotechnicians have had quite a showcase summer at the movies . it seems as though something has been blowing up around every corner--a freight jet in speed , the seven mile bridge in true lies , half of boston in blown away . there are also explosions in clear and present danger , the latest adaptation of tom clancy's best-selling novels , but don't let them fool you into thinking that's all there is to it . clear and present danger is the summer's sharpest thriller , less break-neck than speed but just as consistently tense , and is a quantum improvement over the disappointing patriot games . i wasn't terribly optimistic about clear and present danger after director phillip noyce's sluggish work on patriot games and the appalling sliver , but his work here positively crackles . the level of tension is nearly perfect in scenes that ordinarily would be hum-drum , like a walk through an airport where ryan is being shadowed by clark , but we're often unsure where clark is . there are a few moments where noyce goes overboard , like an inexplicable slow-motion shot of escobedo in a batting cage , and a sequence at a funeral that plays far too much like the baptism sequence from the godfather . these are minor quibbles , however , in a film that comes off as one of the best espionage thrillers in a decade . it might have been even better if harrison ford had managed to break out of his recent habit of playing every part in a slight daze . clear and present danger asks very little from its cast as a whole , though , so ford's lower-than-low-key ryan doesn't seriously detract from the proceedings . but let's be real here : no one expected james bond to be multi-faceted and tormented . clear and present danger is thoroughly plot-driven from minute one , and its oddball screenwriting team of john ( red dawn ) milius and steven ( schindler's list ) zaillian ( along with donald stewart ) do an impressive job with a challenging adaptation . if political moralizing isn't your cup of tea , be forewarned : clear and present danger has more than its share . it also has as much action as the bloated true lies , and nearly as many honest laughs . 
starring : phoebe cates , jim broadbent , wendy hughes , stephen rea , kevin kline , john lithgow . screenplay : michael austin and john wells . director : michael austin . every once in a while , a film sneaks up on me and takes me completely by surprise . i don't necessarily mean in terms of quality ; rather , i'm referring to the mere knowledge of its existence . usually i know what films are on the way a year in advance , but two weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo . it has slipped rather quietly into limited release , and appears destined to slip out just as quietly . that's a shame , because princess caraboo is a delightful fable , romantic , gentle and very appealing . what's more , it's surprisingly insightful and provides a sharp-witted lesson in english social history . as a social satire and comedy of manners , princess caraboo is a winner . but it is handled most effectively through the character of mr . worrall , a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude . while hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule , director and co-writer michael austin keeps the treatment too light-hearted to be heavy-handed . it is then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in " sensations , " an idea that takes on a timeless quality ( and makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show ) . social commentary aside , princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment . the performers are mostly delightful , particularly phoebe cates , who is radiant in a part that requires a gift for pantomime . her supporting players are also appealing : wendy hughes as the patient and kindly mrs . worrall ; kevin kline as frixos , the worralls' suspicious and superior greek butler ; stephen rea as the world-weary but ultimately romantic gutch . only john lithgow is a disappointment , turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princess's identity . the story twists and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really a princess is always in some doubt , without becoming gimmicky . it is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo isn't given more time to develop , because the potential seemed to be there . when it finally does blossom , it seems too quick to be plausible . princess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time and place that it might seem a bit slow to viewers seeking a fantasy romp . still , it has both escapist and intellectual appeal , and is well worth seeking out . it is the kind of film that makes my job its most rewarding--a hidden gem . 
screenplay : scott alexander and larry karaszewski . director : tim burton . it's hard to imagine a more unlikely subject for a film biography than edward d . wood jr . when i think of bio-pics , i think gandhi , my left foot , malcolm x--epic tales of great and inspirational figures . the director of plan 9 from outer space does not seem to be cut from quite the same cloth . the great surprise of ed wood is that in his own unique and twisted way , director tim burton has turned one of the worst filmmakers of all time into one of those inspirational figures . rather than holding wood up to ridicule , burton makes his life an example of artistic integrity , an extremely entertaining look at an auteur unlike any other . with lugosi and girlfriend dolores fuller ( sarah jessica parker ) , ed makes glen or glenda ? , a phenomenally incompetent melodrama . but ed is undaunted by the ridicule of others , and forges ahead to make more films , as well as forging a friendship with the ailing lugosi . burton based his vision for ed wood on one question : what if someone had all the drive of orson welles , but none of the talent ? that question , and its answer , are what make edward d . wood jr . 's story a comedy rather than a tragedy . after every clumsy take becomes not simply a paradigm for self-delusion , but a reminder that sometimes process is as important to art as product . the sincerity with which wood speaks to welles as an equal , and his determination to stay true to his vision , make him anything but pathetic . yet burton manages to tell another story in ed wood , that of the curious friendship between ed and bela lugosi . it is truly an example of mutual need--wood needs lugosi to lend his movies credibility ; lugosi needs wood to give him work , any work--but it's also something even more touching . it is respect which is the greatest gift ed gives him , and laundau's portrayal of his slow return to humanity is one of the finest pieces of acting this year . it is ed wood's niftiest accomplishment that it links these two stories so effortlessly . ed wood's uniquely wonderful naivete comes from the fact that he never fully grasps that hollywood was a business first . he is unable to understand how lugosi could be unable to find work , because to ed , his talent is all that should matter . ed wood is occasionally quite slow-moving , and loses much of its steam in its final twenty minutes . but the affection in burton's telling of this tale is infectious , and makes one wish more talented contemporary filmmakers were as relentlessly individual . 
screenplay : woody allen and douglas mcgrath . director : woody allen . last year's manhattan murder mystery was the kind of light comedy allen hadn't made in years , and seemed to indicate a desire to return to simpler times . bullets over broadway is another comedy , but it's no pure lark . hilarious as it is , it's also a sly bit of self-mockery , an indication that allen the artist acknowledges the foibles of allen the man . in fact , his direction seems a bit too constrained at times , as though the theater itself were creating a kind of claustrophobia . but while this is far from allen's best work as a director , his script , co-written by douglas mcgrath , is fantastic . the dialogue contains as many laugh-out-loud lines as any film this year , and the plot takes at least one twist so delightfully unexpected that its revelation may provide the single biggest laugh . in a year woefully short on good comedies , bullets over broadway may be a saving grace . as usual , allen has a marvelous ensemble cast at his disposal to bring his script to life , though not all are equally well-used . but the two showcase roles belong to dianne wiest and chazz palminteri . it's a wonderful , subtle performance worthy of oscar consideration . yet beneath all the laughs in bullets over broadway is a moral question framed by the reiner character's hypothetical question of which you would save from a burning building : the last copy of shakespeare's works , or some anonymous person . better to be a good man than a great artist , allen seems to argue , and it's difficult not to read that thesis as a minor mea culpa for his tabloid-headline exploits . in the course of exorcising some of his own demons , accompanied by a laugh track , allen has created one of his post purely entertaining films in years . 
screenplay : steve barancik . director : john dahl . the last seduction also made its first appearance on cable earlier this year , but from the looks of things , dahl will be able to make a few films directly for the big screen if he so chooses . film noir has been a hot genre lately , and few directors with more established reputations are making them better than john dahl . the last seduction is a wonderfully nasty piece of work , sparked by linda fiorentino's bad-to-the-bone lead performance . the critical error many recent film noir attempts have made ( the abysmal color of night comes most quickly to mind ) is that they operate on the premise that all you need are minimalist lighting and a few plot twists to maintain audience interest . characters become props holding up a plot , rather than the elements that drive the plot . dahl and screenwriter steve barancik do not make that error . in order for the last seduction to work to the fullest , berg has to convince us that there's a reason besides simple naivete that he stays with bridget , and he makes mike's need genuine . occasionally , that seems to be the case . because barancik deliberately avoids providing us with any easy motivation for bridget's actions ( a troubled childhood , for example ) , her calculation becomes a bit difficult to swallow in one gulp . but fiorentino is so alive in this part that she makes bridget real , and her glee is infectuous . the last seduction's plot does have the requisite twists , turns and surprises , but none of them are particularly jaw-dropping . dahl and barancik are more concerned with tone and character , and deliver in both categories . but if there is one aspect of the story which is truly impressive , it is what * doesn't * happen . the formulaic qualities of so many movies have conditioned us to expect a comeuppance for characters like bridget at a specific plot point ; however , at crucial moments when it seems that she's made a critical mistake , she's still one step ahead . clockwork plots like the last seduction can sometimes seem too contrived for their own good , and some viewere might find it simply too cold . many others will find fiorentino and the last seduction the perfect antidote to the recent glut of stylish but vacuous blockbusters . 
and that's the good news . this is the first directorial effort by peter mccarthy , producer of such films as repo man and tapeheads , and those credits should tell you all you need to know about the style and tone of floundering . it's a hilariously surreal examination of urban paranoia and hopelessness , filled with oddball characters , goofy stream-of-consciousness narrative and instantly quotable lines . floundering is told through a voiceover narration by john , but it's not so much about john as it is about the chaotic world around him . john is only the tour guide , but his observations are wonderfully off-the-wall : on the destruction in south central l . a . : " maybe we should leave it as a reminder . . . then [peter] ueberroth will turn it into a riot theme park . " if you ever walk into a room and find yourself instantly attracted to someone , get out of that room as fast as you can . " mccarthy's script is rich with such moments . unfortunately , it's also rich with heavy-handed left-wing moralizing which could easily turn off those with differing points of view . it's therefore very fortunate that so many of the other minor roles are so funny . the snapshots taken by his mental camera provide a bitingly satirical collage of urban life , but surprisingly mccarthy doesn't opt for utter cynicism . instead , he manages to balance black-humored sarcasm and social commentary with an ultimately optimistic message of personal responsibility . for those who enjoy their comedy with an edge and don't mind the occasional preaching , there's a real winner to be found in floundering . besides , how can you not love a film that ends with two guitarists , one black and one white , singing a marvelously off-key duet of " ( what's so funny 'bout ) peace , love and understanding ?

maybe it's envy , maybe it's years of hollywood trying to sell every pretty boy or gorgeous girl as the next big thing , and maybe it's some combination of the two . for whatever reason , both moviegoers and critics alike seem to have incredible difficulty acknowledging that attractiveness and talent could go hand in hand . when he won as best actor in 1987 for the color of money , it was widely considered a lifetime achievement award , but apparently newman had at least one more trick up his sleeve : nobody's fool , a small , quiet drama driven by newman's delightfully weathered lead performance . but during this holiday season , there are other opportunities . writer/director robert benton has a gift for making low-key , relationship-based films ( kramer vs . kramer , places in the heart ) , and nobody's fool is a worthy heir to that tradition . benton uses his snow-covered locations beautifully , practically turning north bath into one of the characters in the story . in many ways , nobody's fool is as much about north bath as it is about sully . that connectedness makes the relationships between characters in nobody's fool a rare joy . sully's feud with carl is one of the few external conflicts in the film , manifested primarily in a game of stealing a snow-blower back and forth , but even that exchange is essentially good-humored . it's one of the things that makes sully so appealing as a character : as ornery as he can be , he always treats people decently . it's ironic--and perhaps part of the point of nobody's fool--that the one relationship which seems forced is that between sully and peter . still , there's something strangely satisfying about a meeting between an estranged father and son which doesn't include a shouting match or tears . he has reached a point in his career where he doesn't really play characters any more ; instead , he slips into them like the flannel shirts sully favors . that is in no way meant to belittle what newman does as an actor . the fact is that he makes it all look effortless , as though he's really been sully all his life , and someone just happened to turn the camera on at this moment . the background for the character ( an abusive father , his own abandonment of his family ) seems almost tacked on so the movie seems to be about something more , but newman doesn't really need it . it's newman's gift that he can do all that with a well-placed sigh and a twinkle in those eyes . 
arriving as it does in the middle of the newt gingrich-generated national discussion on the benefits of removing children from unstable homes , ladybird , ladybird could not be more timely . and while director ken loach could not possibly have realized it , he has made a film which should inspire both sides in this debate to consider their points of view more carefully . harrowing , challenging yet never pedantic , ladybird , ladybird is about as balanced a presentation of a difficult issue as one could hope for , a portrait of a self-destructive woman colliding with a by-the-book system , and brought to breathtaking life by a knockout debut performance from crissy rock . he tells maggie's story in a straight-ahead fashion , eschewing cinematic hyperbole or heavy musical cues . it is a dramatic enough story in its own right , and loach knows it . this is a story in which , ultimately , there are no winners , and loach refuses to let us off the hook by giving us a convenient villain . what really makes the ambiguity work is the incendiary performance by crissy rock , who had never acted before ladybird . hard-edged and painfully low on self-esteem , maggie repeatedly torpedoes her own chances for happiness by refusing to believe that she deserves any , and rock plays this out in several incredibly emotional scenes , every one of which feels completely honest . she layers maggie's character so expertly that at times it truly does appear that she is an unfit mother , making it hard to fault the government's intentions . it's powerful work by a performer who understands instinctively that a character like this has to be real , and rock truly becomes maggie . in fact , she's so powerful that she completely eclipses vladimir vega's jorge , whose character is never developed quite as fully as maggie's . there's a reason that he sticks by her through so much hardship , but i , like maggie , wasn't always sure what that reason was . the screenplay by rona munro , though based on a true story , is dramatically unwieldy towards the end ; scenes begin to repeat themselves , and i started to feel that i was being put through an emotional wringer . it's one of those cases where a bit of license with fact might have made for a tighter and even more effective story . but it amounts to quibbling to fault ladybird , ladybird for being too true to a gripping story . it's a film that makes demands of its audience , specifically to look at this story and to reach its own conclusions about whether or not maggie was treated fairly . her story is so riveting , and so spectacularly re-created by crissy rock , that any audience should be up to that challenge . 
screenplay : riwia brown . director : lee tamahori . critics are often heard complaining about the lack of originality in american filmmaking , about remakes , tv-retreads and tired concepts dominating the multiplexes . once were warriors is a wonderful example of what the movie-going experience can teach us given the opportunity . as an examination of the maori culture in contemporary new zealand , once were warriors showed me a world i had never seen before , and up until its overly melodramatic final half hour , it is a fascinating and unsettling drama . once were warriors has become a massive box office success in new zealand for addressing this culture which accounts for almost 10% of its population , but it doesn't require a stretch to recognize that it is a story which translates all too well to stories of america's economically disadvantaged minority cultures . it is a specific story , but in many ways it is also a universal one . the specific story is most effective thanks to several powerful performances . temuera morrison is even more complex as jake , because he makes a violent drunk appealing enough during his good moments to make the relationship convincing ; he is fred flintstone with a serious attitude . mamaengaroa kerr-bell , as the ever-more- pessimistic grace , is also good , as is taungaroa emile as the troubled boogie . while it is frighteningly real violence which drives once were warriors for much of its running time , pathos unfortunately takes over in the third act . there is a drawn-out sequence which gives everyone a chance to cry and make a speech , and characters start to speak in platitudes like , " you're still a slave , jake . . . a slave to your fists " and " i'll wear my ( tatoos ) on the inside . " by the end , i was wondering whether tamahori was taking his cue from hollywood , providing a feel-good resolution which tied up loose ends far too neatly , rather than sticking with the harsh realities of the world in which he has placed us . once were warriors is filled with memorable images , solid acting and a keen sense of place and character , but without even realizing it , tamahori has also told a story about urban sub-cultures far from his own home . 
screenplay/director : jeremy leven . once upon a time , marlon brando was considered by many to be the best american actor in film . brando has been on the big screen only a handful of times in the last twenty years , so the myth has transcended the actor . that is a shame , because not only can the man still act , he has shown a great sense of humor about himself . as writer , he has crafted a screenplay full of instantly quotable lines . but as clever a script as he has at his disposal , it is one of leven's choices as a director which makes it something special . while the narrated flashbacks of don juan's life are given a surreal tinge both by the nature of the subjects and don juan's florid description , the scenes involving interactions between other characters are almost hyper-real . the dialogue is simple , with lines frequently overlapping , and the camera is usually stationary . leven also coaxes two superb performances out of his lead actors . it is a light and very funny performance , matched and perhaps surpassed by johnny depp . he works so well , in fact , that several scenes between brando and dunaway probably ended up on the cutting room floor to allow depp's character more screen time . that's something of a shame , because the film is really about how mickler changes , and how those changes re-energize his marriage , and dunaway is too good to be so under-used . however , it is quibbling to fault don juan de marco for what isn't on the screen , when what is on the screen is so appealing . sweet , funny and unapologetically upbeat , don juan de marco is a perfect breezy spring entertainment . 
period adventures have been around as long as the movies . throughout that time , and especially into modern efforts , such films have rarely navigated successfully between the twin perils of the genre : tedious hero-worship on the one hand , grade-b schlock on the other . rare is the film that manages to be both exciting and intelligent , both compelling as character-based drama and a good old-fashioned good guys vs . bad guys tale . though the film's love story doesn't quite click , the main story is wonderfully acted and exhilarating to watch . the plot of rob roy is a fairly dense one , including a healthy dose of post-restoration english political machinations which might leave many viewers wondering why being accused of being a " jacobite " would be such a big deal . these instances are rare enough , however , not to be distracting . perhaps one reason is that in its structure and tone , rob roy has the archetypal appeal of a shakespeare play , with the political elements serving only to set up conflicts , not to define them . alan sharp's screenplay makes sure that even though the characters have mythic dimensions , they do not remain one-dimensional . that's the academic end . rob roy is also just a fine piece of movie-making , beginning with the superb direction of michael caton-jones . his opening shot is the perfect introduction to an epic , a breathtaking view of the highlands into which the characters slowly wander and draw closer . the pacing lags here and there , and the more brutal elements of the story are occasionally excessive , but those are exceptions in an otherwise top-notch job , particularly a pair of magnificently staged duels . special note should also go to carter burwell , who provides a stirring celtic-themed score . for my money though , rob roy works fundamentally because its villains--all three of them--are fantastic . as fine a job as liam neeson does with macgregor , his character is essentially a legend , a striking figure but fairly static . as for lange , she may be the weak link . her acting style has never been one of my favorites , and sometimes her emotions feel forced . rob roy tries to build the love story between rob and mary into one of the central elements , but the conflict between rob and the englishmen is always more interesting . nevertheless , all the elements combine into an extremely satisfying whole . rob roy is not for the squeamish , with its swordplay and a lengthy rape scene , nor is it for those looking strictly for a lusty romp . it is a story about characters as much as it is about battles , and it succeeds as both . 
they are the times that can make me begin to question what it is i am looking for in escapist entertainment , as i read raves for hyped-up disappointments like twister and mission : impossible and wonder what it is that i am supposed to be missing . they are the times when a piece of fluff like dragonheart seems that much better when compared to the competition , and they are the times when a film like the arrival , lacking a big star or never-before-seen special effects , will likely drown in a sea of higher-profile releases . but the arrival is the kind of thriller which reminds me _exactly_ what i'm looking for in escapist entertainment : a script which has genuine wit , genuine intelligence , and genuine excitement , and which convinces me that the writer spent at least as much time creating it as i spent watching it . that perfectly describes the arrival . the arrival marks the directing debut of writer david twohy ( the fugitive and the under-appreciated terminal velocity ) , and he demonstrates such a keen understanding of what makes an action thriller work that it seems he was born for the job . in the first minute of the film , he grabbed me by the collar with a beautifully constructed opening sequence , and for the next 109 minutes he simply refused to let go . there are sequences in the arrival which play like textbook examples of how to build tension , particularly one involving a room full of scorpions which is guaranteed to have you squirming if you have a pulse . there is a kind of suspense which plots based on paranoia are much better at generating , and twohy nails it , as well as turning it to humorous effect by connecting the greenhouse effect and the failure of the hubble telescope to alien visitors . that is really what separates the arrival from the pack : a sense of humor which surpasses most of the so-called comedies i see in any given year . sheen has a solid , deadpan sense of comic timing which worked well with twohy's terminal velocity script , and again he wraps each line in a wry self-awareness . zane is not a particularly dynamic role -- he's gung-ho about finding extra-terrestrial life , but it's never quite clear why -- and another actor might have given it more depth . however , sheen makes the comic lines feel un-scripted , and he appears to be adept at playing twohy's favored hero -- a resourceful individual whose actions under duress seem natural and basically intelligent . plus , there is a priceless irony to sheen , the most notorious and unapologetic customer of " hollywood madam " heidi fleiss , reading the line , " there's something to be said for abstinence . " the arrival is so effective in some of its early scenes that the big sequence in the aliens' lair comes as something of a disappointment , since twohy seems less concerned with maintaining the pace than he is with showing off his visual effects . there are a few logical errors i caught upon reflection , and the abrupt ending is likely to leave some viewers feeling a bit unsatisfied . but the arrival is a rarity so far this summer movie season : it is a smart and tightly-plotted film that i couldn't always out-guess , and didn't always find myself _trying_ to out-guess . i was so instantly aware of how skillfully david twohy could manipulate me that i simply let him . and that , friends , is how i define " willing suspension of disbelief . " i shot andy warhol is exceedingly well-documented , and that makes it great journalism . mary harron directs her actors and her environment to perfection , and that makes it great theater . what is missing is human drama , and a sense of what this story is really about . that , quite simply , does not make a great film . 
screenplay : julian schnabel . director : julian schnabel . yes , i understand : happy artists do not exactly make for compelling drama . still , you have to admit that the cult of the tortured artist seems to have more adherents in hollywood than scientology . toulouse-lautrec in moulin rouge . . . tortured . so why is it that basquiat feels so completely unique ? perhaps it is because , for a change , its principal character is portrayed as a tortured human being first and foremost . this measured approach is surprising not just because write-director julian schnabel is a first-time film-maker , or because he was a friend of the film's subject , haitian-american artist jean-michel basquiat ( jeffrey wright ) , but because schnabel himself is an artist of no small renown . it has been a characteristic of the works of artists-turned-auteurs ( including andy warhol's and the ugly recent example of robert longo's johnny mnemonic ) that you could expect to find very little beyond the images . schnabel does create some extremely arresting images , including a sharp opening title sequence underscored by the pogues , but he has also left no doubt that this is a film about _someone_ , about some_thing_ . basquiat is a film full of vibrant characters , none more so than jean-michel basquiat himself . jeffrey wright , a tony award-winning stage actor , gives a stunning performance as basquiat , a lonely wraith who always seems to be hovering just on the edge of coherence . but schnabel also manages to show how absurdly easy art came to basquiat . indeed , when he is creating is the only time he does not seem to be suffering . it is also impressive that schnabel is savvy and confident enough to acknowledge the flaws of his own milieu , and the perceptions of the general public towards that milieu . the battle to represent basquiat is sometimes presented in melodramatic terms , with the artist forgetting the little people as he hits the big time , but schnabel doesn't gloss over the cult of personality of the art world . he adds the year's second superb portrayal of andy warhol , with david bowie perhaps providing even more clever detachment than jared harris's work in i shot andy warhol . watch also for a marvelous scene in which christopher walken plays a journalist interviewing basquiat , trying to bait him with subtle jabs at abstract modern art ; he speaks for everyone convinced that art is an elaborate con . there are a few clumsy moments in the structure of basquiat , notably the presentation of his relationship with another aspiring artist ( claire forlani ) , and the first half of the film is rather sluggishly paced . still , for a newcomer to film , julian schnabel is remarkably assured . basquiat is not about art as torture . 
screenplay : douglas mcgrath . director : douglas mcgrath . she was the lead character in a smart and utterly charming 1994 film called clueless , although she was never expressly named , and that makes emma an experience of intense deja vu , even more so given the spate of recent adaptations of other jane austen novels . that places everyone involved with emma in positions of uncomfortable but inevitable immediate comparison -- director douglas mcgrath trying to portray upper class life in 19th century england as artfully as sense and sensibility's ang lee , gwyneth paltrow competing with alicia silverstone for brattish adorability , and so on . given these challenges , emma becomes almost more entertaining than it already is on its own merits , another witty and winning addition to the austen canon , in which paltrow becomes a bona fide leading lady . as i considered gwyneth paltrow's performance in emma , i recalled an old george carlin routine in which he concluded that the reason dogs were more expressive than cats was that dogs had eyebrows . this observation in no way means to compare paltrow to a dog ( far from it , though that is another kettle of hormones entirely ) , but to describe why i think paltrow may be the most expressive young actress working : in short , she has phenomenal eyebrows . if it seems i am doing an injustice to her ability to interpret a line , or to her impressive british accent , i do not mean to do so . it is simply that there are moments in emma where paltrow adopts a facial expression so utterly perfect that her infuriating ability to make you care about her despite her pettiness and manipulation seems drawn from the soul of austen's novel . there are actors in films today that it is distressingly clear will never know how to act with a degree of subtlety which allows a shift of the eye or a hint of a frown to advance their character . at the ripe old age of 22 , gwyneth paltrow gives a clinic on acting for the screen in emma . it is a blessing that she is able to do so , since she has to carry much of the first half of the film . mcgrath's rookie direction is somewhat static , and the harriet-emma-mr . elton triangle is hampered by a surprisingly stuffy performance by toni collette . it is the late introduction of frank churchill and mr . elton's new wife ( juliet stevenson ) which kick-starts emma into enough energy to match its cleverness . emma finds a match of another kind in mrs . elton , a self-obsessed busybody whom emma comes to dislike intensely , perhaps because they are too much alike , and juliet stevenson plays the part of the shrew with a casual good humor which undercuts the stereotype . and i would be remiss in not pointing out the delightful performances by sophie thompson as the garrulous spinster miss bates and jeremy northam as the dashing mr . knightley . but mcgrath's screenplay is a gem of humor and sparkling characterizations , and is more than faithful to the spirit of his source material . most importantly , he has cast his lead role with a keen sense of its challenges -- he needed an actor with a willingness to play a vain , foolish and snobbish young woman without winking at us to make sure we don't dislike her . she trusts her ability to make emma's good heart shine through her youthful conviction in her own infallibility , and mcgrath is wise to trust her as well . both prove far from clueless in that respect . 
screenplay : john herzfeld . director : john herzfeld . running time : 100 minutes . the thing that goes dreadfully wrong with so many twisty-turny suspense yarns is that they operate under the mis-guided impression that they need nothing _except_ twists and turns to be engaging , a perfect example being the recent the rich man's wife . it is a variation on the kind of lazy , cynical film-making which produces action films like twister , in which the writers and directors hope that they can keep jerking us around to the point where we don't notice that there aren't any people in their films . i expected 2 days in the valley to be that kind of film , yet another hipper-than-thou exercise in violence and vacuity . but writer-director john herzfeld has put together a complex plot in which -- get this -- the characters actually matter , and which has more great roles for actors than a dozen recent hollywood films put together . there are some aspects of 2 days in the valley which are reminiscent of other recent stabs at hard-boiled avant garde , and for a while they concerned me . yet as john herzfeld's story unfolded , i began to find myself drawn into his characterizations , and to realize that this was one of those rare films where even minor players seemed to have a life of their own . that one scene speaks volumes about teddy , about the embittered actor , and about hollywood's loathing of failure , and it is typical of the economy with which herzfeld is able to deliver fully-formed characters . mazursky's teddy is one of the two pivotal characters in 2 days in the valley , and his performance is superb , particularly early in the film . his relationship with his dog makes for one of the most touching scenes i have seen this year , as his life is saved quite literally by the love of his pet , and mazursky's puffy , defeated demeanor is perfect . danny aiello is equally sharp as a wiseguy with something to prove , and a bigger heart than anyone expects . they are surrounded by winning performances -- even spader achieves a surprising level of capricious menace -- but mazursky and aiello are always at the center of a film which gives you the opportunity to care about the people in it . i should make something very clear at this point : 2 days in the valley is smartly plotted , with enough unexpected detours to satisfy the most die-hard lovers of cinematic guessing games . it never strays particularly far from the conventions of gritty pot-boilers , including plenty of gratuitous sex and violence , and even one heck of a brutal cat-fight between hatcher and charlize theron as lee's ice queen girlfriend . . what is surprising about 2 days in the valley is that after every twist has played itself out , it is not the twists which are memorable . it is a genuinely human redemption story wrapped in a dark , violent thriller . if herzfeld leaves a few loose ends , i was willing to forgive him because he trusted an audience with a character-driven film in a plot-driven genre . that is a twist i was not expecting . 
screenplay : andy wachowski , larry wachowski . producers : andrew lazar , stewart boros . running time : 108 minutes . it's always the same old story : there's a poor sap just out of the joint , just trying to make a buck to get by . there's money as part of the bargain . yep , it's the same old story . . . except you might expect bound to try to cruise along on little more than its gender-bending premise , but you would be wrong . bound is a wickedly entertaining thriller with a gloriously manic performance by joe pantoliano , and it doesn't need gimmicks to succeed . the first act of bound sticks quite close to the standard film noir formula story line outlined above , complete with femme fatale violet seducing corky with drinks and double-entendre , corky engaging in suspicious second-guessing , and a partnership in crime which seems less than entirely trustworthy . gershon ( showgirls ) , sporting lips so full she seems unable to close her mouth entirely , makes an acceptable stand-in for the usual male dumb lug , with just a touch of bogart's world-weary cynicism . i suppose the thing that makes bound particularly satisfying is that it is simply a very good thriller -- suspenseful , unpredictable , well-acted and stylishly directed . on one level , i suppose you could argue that the lesbian angle is unnecessary , and that the wachowskis include it simply for titillation value , but it is precisely because it is unnecessary that i think it is so noteworthy . bound would have been just as effective if corky had been a man , or if caesar had been a woman , or if all three main characters had been men . it was not all that long ago that film-makers began talking about " color-blind casting , " choosing actors not because their race or ethnicity was intrinsic to the roles but because they were the best actors available for those roles . in bound , gina gershon makes a sharp little suspense thriller that much more intriguing by being perhaps the first example of " sexuality-blind casting . " here's to the poor saps of the world , whatever their gender . 
director : baz luhrmann . screenplay : craig pearce and baz luhrmann . director of photography : donald mcalpine . producers : gabriella martinelli , baz luhrmann . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( adult themes , violence ) running time : 121 minutes . william shakespeare's romeo and juliet is an exercise in such sheer audacity that you will probably want either to stand up and applaud director baz luhrmann or smack him in the head . i mean , using jump cuts , fast-motion , american accents and rock music , then calling his film _william shakespeare's_ romeo and juliet ? you need two pairs of pants to hold cajones that big , but this is one of those rare cases where nothing succeeds like excess . al pacino tried to make shakespeare " relevant " with a hyped-up lecture in looking for richard ; luhrmann's glorious and gaudy romeo and juliet does it right . it is a work full of energy , humor and surprisingly gentle romance . for half an hour or so , you might wonder whether luhrmann and his co-writer craig pearce have decided to turn the love story into an afterthought . the film's first image is a television screen , featuring a news anchorwoman introducing the events ; luhrmann then bursts directly into the conflict between the montagues and the capulets with a face-off at a gas station . that face-off is staged with frenzied editing more akin to robert rodriguez than franco zeffirelli , and there is scarcely time for a breath before we barrel into the costume ball , where mercutio ( played with dazzle and fire by smoke's harold perrineau ) prances in drag to disco . once they do meet , however , the wait seems quite worthwhile . their connection registers immediately , one of the most effective and convincing portrayals of love at first sight i have seen in years , and danes and dicaprio share a sweet but powerful chemistry . they may be the best male and female actors of their generation , respectively , and they give themselves both to the characters and to the language so completely that they seem to be discovering the 400-year-old text for the first time . luhrmann directs their moments together as idyllic interludes in a world of chaos and violence , but he also gives them a fair amount of sexual double-entendre , and anyone with more than a nodding acquaintance with the bard knows that lurhmann didn't create those bawdy references himself to appeal to the teenagers in the audience . he is interested in those young viewers , however , and that is what makes his vision of william shakespeare's romeo and juliet so faithful even in its iconoclasm . through it all , luhrmann also manages to make shakespeare's words an integral part of his film . the rapid , colloquial deliver of those words occasionally overwhelms them , and luhrmann doesn't always know when to turn down the adrenaline . luhrmann took his own stab at looking for shakespeare , and may end up showing him to an entirely new audience . 
director : ron howard . screenplay : richard price and alexander ignon . director of photography : piotr sobocinski . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , adult themes ) running time : 121 minutes . i should note before anything else that ransom is not a spectacular , classic piece of film-making , but simply a very well-crafted action/suspense thriller . it is only because so many of its genre contemporaries have been so lackluster that ransom begins to look like a jewel , because ransom is a textbook example of the little things which so many bad to mediocre suspense thrillers could do to become better by orders of magnitude . in fact , the conventional wisdom in hollywood -- borne out by the success of twister , the rock and independence day as recent examples -- is that suspense is actually counter-productive because the establishment of suspense takes time , valuable minutes which will not involve a 10 megaton explosion or a flying computer-generated cow . ransom is consistently tense because it is patient , patient enough to set up characters and situations in a way which really pays off . desperate to even the odds , tom takes drastic and risky action to put the kidnapers on the defensive , the result of which can only be either complete victory or the worst kind of defeat . ransom begins with the radical premise that its characters actually matter , and uses that premise to build a story which matters from moment to moment . mullen is far from a shining knight as our protagonist , but rather a hard-nosed and occasionally unscrupulous businessman whose rebellious stand against the kidnapers is perhaps as much a result of guilt as logic . these are not spectacularly complex characters -- rene russo's kate is actually something of a disappointment as the wife who does little but sob -- but they are real people , and they are directed by ron howard in scenes which allow you inside their heads at critical , decisive moments . howard also has the ability to take moments which in other hands might have been quickly dispatched plot points and make them compelling . the story would have progressed without the lengthy sequence in which tom and kate realize that sean is missing , but the tension and mounting dread in howard's direction are palpable . even minor details like the first notification from the kidnapers -- a jittery video file sent to the mullens via email -- is given a spark which elicits a gasp from the audience . ransom does have its obligatory moments of action and violence , but howard refuses to treat those sequences as the purpose for his movie . there is a driving tension and a natural rhythm to the structure of ransom which doesn't make it feel like the director and screenwriters are trying to exhaust you with set pieces . although there are flashy moments in ransom , notably a telephone confrontation between jimmy and tom which is edited to whiplash perfection , it is notable in its lack of devotion to flash ; it is that rare action thriller where you anticipate the moment the characters _start_ talking instead of the moment they _stop_ . ransom may cop out on giving us a climax which addresses the more unsavory aspects of tom's character , but it deserves recognition as an example of professionalism in film-making , of what is possible when someone seems to give a damn . too many thrillers swing for the fences every time up , and end up striking out most of the time . 
[note that followups are directed to rec . arts . movies . current-films and rec . arts . movies . startrek . current only , not to rec . arts . sf . movies . screenplay : ronald d . moore and brannon braga . director : jonathan frakes . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , violence ) running time : 105 minutes . paramount's " star trek " franchise needs the current crew much more than the crew needs the franchise , and that is something of a shift in the balance of power from the original crew . to be even more specific , the franchise needs patrick stewart . far and away the best actor ever to don a starfleet uniform , stewart is the standard bearer for a series which has the opportunity to thrive as long as stories can be built around captain jean-luc picard , a character with unlimited potential in the hands of such a talented performer . star trek : first contact is built around stewart's picard , which is the first of many things the eighth trek feature does right . it is up to the enterprise crew to make sure that flight takes place , despite a borg takeover of the enterprise itself and the surprising reluctance of cochrane . the star trek films have often walked a fine line between being love-ins for the die-hard fans of the television series and accessible adventures for a general audience , and first contact walks an even finer line than most . though brief flashbacks and bits of exposition explain the nature of picard's previous encounter with the borg , familiarity with the episodes of the series in which it took place makes his trauma much more clear , and his obsession more compelling . there are obligatory cameos as well ( including one " voyager " cast member ) which will likely blow right over the heads of the uninitiated , and at least one moment which will be a trekker delight : the generally serene counselor troi ( marina sirtis ) drunk on tequila shots . still , the surprisingly effective work of first-time feature film director jonathan frakes ( who also portrays commander william riker ) makes first contact a solid , suspenseful action film for any fan of the genre , particularly in a tense encounter between borg and crew members which takes place on the hull of the enterprise . if there is likely to be a disappointment for trek fans , it is a change in the nature of the borg which works to mixed effect . krige is creepy and seductive in the role , and the design of her character is sensational , but something is lost in giving the borg a de facto leader . writers ronald d . moore and brannon braga attempt to explain it away in classic trek fashion -- it is one of those mysteries , the queen rasps , which limited minds simply can't understand -- but they are unable to explain away a borg which seems concerned about its own individual survival . krige is nasty enough , however , to make such matters insignificant while you're watching first contact , and she is part of a phenomenon which makes this trek somewhat unique : the acting is good enough from top to bottom to drive the film . but it is stewart who commands both literally and figuratively , making his personal mission to destroy the borg a solid sub-text to a conventional action film . it takes conviction to sell science fiction , and stewart is an actor simply unwilling to play a flat character . frakes keeps the story flowing while switching between the various plot threads , and his steady hand helps make first contact the best trek since 1986's star trek iv : the voyage home , and shows that it is far too early to begin the eulogy for this franchise . this is a smart and snappy adventure in which patrick stewart doesn't just say " make it so " -- he does it . 
mpaa rating : not rated ( graphic depictions of corpses , profanity ) running time : 150 minutes . such are the vagaries of critical opinion , that temporal beast , that i found my experience of joe berlinger and bruce sinofsky's documentary both enhanced and diminished by recent pervasive coverage of high-profile murder cases . as a carefully constructed detective story , paradise lost is riveting ; as a study of small town america at its best and its worst , it is compelling . however , as an examination of publicly-aired grief and suspicion of the criminal justice system , it is merely exemplary rather than extraordinary . damien , an occult-fascinated , heavy metal-listening eccentric , is particularly tailor-made for prosecution , but there are potential problems with the case . there also happens to be virtually no physical evidence , and plenty to suggest that the crimes may have occurred somewhere beside the muddy ditch where the bodies were found . the first half hour of paradise lost introduces us to a fascinating cast of characters , and to a setting which is as critical to the case as any piece of evidence . hovering over the proceedings like a dark angel is the film's most enigmatic figure , damien echols -- a perceptive , self-absorbed and vaguely frightening young man who is like a satanist from central casting . the courtroom scenes are rife with the kind of confrontations familiar from both fictional and real-life proceedings , but the knowledge of its reality makes every unexpected revelation all the more enthralling . then new bits of evidence keep exploding like land mines . it is a case of such complexity that any amateur juror who has railed against noteworthy verdicts should be forced to watch paradise lost as a civics lesson . the courtroom drama of paradise lost is certainly intriguing , but i think the film spends a bit too much time in the courtroom , because the actual evidence is only half the story . outrage against the concept of presumed innocence just isn't news in this age , and paradise lost simply underlines this trend rather than exposing it . that is not to diminish its power -- paradise lost will have you asking yourself questions long after it ends . perhaps by the time i reach my own personal verdict , its power will have overwhelmed its familiarity entirely . 
screenplay : kenneth branagh , based on the play by william shakespeare . director : kenneth branagh . kenneth branagh's hamlet is the first film version of shakespeare's revered tragedy to use the full , uncut text , and you know what that means : before you settle into your theater seat , smoke 'em if you got 'em , be sure to use the restroom , and bring extra quarters for parking . this hamlet is 238 minutes long -- 258 including the intermission -- making it one of the longest films ever produced for theatrical distribution . it is a terribly risky undertaking , but branagh has proven once again that the bard is safe in his hands . his hamlet does a remarkable job of demonstrating exactly how much is lost in edited versions of the play , re-vitalizing characterizations and offering a visual spectacle . it is a worthy challenger to laurence olivier's 1948 hamlet as the definitive film interpretation of the text . that bare bones synopsis cannot even begin to do justice to the complexity of hamlet , of course , but neither do many abbreviated film and stage versions . branagh's use of the entire text proves to be far more than a purist conceit , as he reveals additional layers of meaning . this hamlet is richer than any other you might have known because every piece of sub-text remains in the text . it is also a version which uses the unique opportunities of cinema better than any other . branagh has an instinct for excess in his film direction , but his dedication to shakespeare has anchored his adaptations of henry v and much ado about nothing where mary shelley's frankenstein and dead again occasionally got away from him . combining creative interpretive choices for the characters ( polonius [richard briers] becomes more malevolent and hypocritical as he is shown with a prostitute before sending someone to check up on laertes in france ) with superb technical credits ( tim harvey's dazzling production design and alex byrne's elegant , evocative 19th century costumes ) , branagh adds another thoroughly cinematic shakespeare to his resume . his direction may be nearly unimpeachable , but there are other areas where branagh's " more is more " philosophy are a hindrance . the casting of several familiar faces in minor roles feels more like a stunt than an artistic choice , and while crystal and charlton heston ( as the player king ) in particular are surprisingly effective in their roles , the effect is more often to turn hamlet into a hollywood sight-seeing tour : " look , there's gerard depardieu ! look , there's robin williams ! " branagh's lead performance is also distracting , and not because he makes poor character choices ( unless his bleached-blond hair counts ) ; the problem is that he is playing to the balcony even though he is on a movie screen . there may be one too many scenes in which spittle flies from the thin lips of his impassioned hamlet , and while branagh has a firm grasp of the dane's lighter side , his emoting is often forced . still , it is hard to come down too hard on a man who not only committed himself to the most challenging role in the history of theater , but directed an epic period production of the most challenging play in the history of theater . branagh took an exceptional gamble , and it paid off in an exceptional film . take a chance on spending 238 minutes to stretch your understanding of this remarkable play ; you can always stretch your legs during the intermission . 
screenplay : scott alexander and larry karaszewski . director : milos forman . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , sexual situations , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 130 minutes . the people vs . larry flynt is such an intriguing and entertaining film biography that it is almost a shame that it had to have a " message . " milos forman's study of " hustler " magazine publisher larry flynt is an examination of the challenge of accepting potentially offensive material as protected speech under the constitution , and as such it is not in the same class as solemnly liberal films which congratulate themselves for championing radical notions like " racism is a bad thing . " still , there is a slickness to the way flynt's legal battles are portrayed which makes it too easy to choose sides . larry flynt soars . screenwriters scott alexander and larry karaszewski also wrote the script for tim burton's ed wood , and flynt demonstrates once again that they have a marvelous sense for crafting structure out of eccentricity . flynt is rendered variously as a libertine capitalist selling what america is buying , as a half-hearted christian convert and as a bitter , unpredictable paraplegic , yet every facet of his character becomes part of a fascinating whole in woody harrelson's performance . it is a dynamic piece of acting : sly and blisteringly funny one moment , quiet and emotional the next . few actors can muster that kind of fearlessness . the people vs . larry flynt is frequently hilarious as it explores the characters' relationships and challenging in its reluctance to offer embraceable heroes . when it hits the courtrooms , the lines become more clearly drawn , to the film's detriment . giving flynt's enemies a face which is easy to laugh at diffuses the point of the film when it is no longer " the people " who are versus flynt , but simply some nasty stuffed shirts . flynt's speech is deserving of protection not because he is better than his accusers , but because it shouldn't matter who is better ; when flynt tells reporters that a victory for him would be important because he is " the worst , " it is fairly obvious that alexander , karaszewski and forman don't agree . all the legal wranglings come to a thrilling conclusion , however , in what may be the best courtroom scene i have ever seen . at that moment , the issues at the heart of the people vs . larry flynt matter profoundly , with norton's passionate defense shattering the earlier dichotomies of right vs . wrong . it made me more disappointed in an earlier scene in which flynt gives a sincere speech to civil libertarians which is presented without a hint of irony . larry flynt , manic smut-peddler , makes for a much more compelling protagonist than larry flynt , first amendment hero . 
screenplay : gregory poirier . director : john singleton . mpaa rating : r ( violence , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 139 minutes . this not-so-anecdotal aside is offered for anyone who might think of rosewood simply as a sad footnote in american history . even if that were the case , john singleton's rosewood would still be a powerful drama , but it is something more . it is a chilling study of the culture of racism which challenges us to consider whether we still live in a country where , as one character in rosewood describes it , " nigger is just another word for guilty . " in rosewood , we have the opportunity to get to know the inhabitants of both sumner and rosewood as individuals , compounding the tragedy even as it makes the triumphs more affecting . the great success of rosewood is that it turns its story into broader commentary on how racism functions without sacrificing that story . many of the individual images in rosewood are riveting , portraying unromanticized violence and pastoral beauty with equal effectiveness thanks to the impressive cinematography of johnny e . jensen . then , beyond the events of the principal narrative , you begin to notice that rosewood is presenting one of the most complex examinations of racism ever committed to film . characters are not presented in black-and-white in their views of black and white . it is one of the film's most chilling moments when the mob acknowledges with a chuckle that no one really believes a black man assaulted the notably promiscuous fannie . for them , a lynch mob isn't even about some perverted notion of justice . it's just how the world is . it's worth sticking through to the ending because in rosewood , the ending is actually a sort of beginning . though we only need to look at headlines to understand that rosewood sometimes is about the way the world still is , it is also about the way the world could be . 
director : mike newell . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , violence , brief nudity , sexual situations ) running time : 125 minutes . at first glance , lefty ruggiero ( al pacino ) seems like a dozen movie mobsters you have seen before , like a dozen movie mobsters pacino has played before . don't judge lefty , or donnie brasco , by that first impression , though lefty himself might have preferred it . as it turns out , the domestic drama in donnie brasco is actually the least interesting aspect of the film . anne heche is stuck with the thankless " long-suffering wife " role , with predictable lines in predictable scenes ; it's hard to imagine anyone giving an interesting spin to a line like " you're becoming like them . " depp's performance is solid and under-stated , a welcome shift from his string of saintly eccentrics . the reason those scenes are most frustrating , though , is that lefty is so much more fascinating a character than joseph/donnie . al pacino has often been prone to bigger-is-better style of acting , but in donnie brasco he harnesses that impulse to turn in his best performance in at least fifteen years . as we watch lefty fold in on himself in disappointment -- compounded by the fact that he believes donnie has stabbed him in the back to earn sonny's favor -- it is impossible not to feel sympathy for him . pacino's performance is sweet , crude , funny and haunted , and gives donnie brasco an unexpected emotional pull . lefty's hard life is made all the more tragic by the way organized crime is portrayed . under the direction of mike newell ( four weddings and a funeral ) , donnie brasco doesn't crackle with the same energy as films set in this world made by scorsese or depalma , but it is a different impression of mob life newell and gifted screenwriter paul attanasio ( quiz show ) are after . where other films have made mob life seem terribly attractive and glamorous , donnie brasco shows it as petty and tedious . they are more like inter-office bickering gone haywire , and the rare ( but extremely graphic ) moments of violence leave everyone's hands dirty . the beauty of attanasio's script -- and pacino's performance -- are that they make lefty's dedication to his role as lowest man in the lowest crew something touching . 
the sum total of my direct familiarity with howard stern , including the 110 minutes of private parts , now stands at about 114 minutes . before seeing the film i had not read his book , had never heard his radio program , and seen him only in passing as a guest on t . v . talk shows or on his own e ! entertainment television program . i knew stern only indirectly , as a much-reviled icon of all things excessive and an object of adoration for devoted fan base , but i did not know enough about him to have a real opinion . i suspect that mine was the best possible point of entry for private parts , because i was expecting neither to hate it nor to revel in vulgarity . without the burden of preconceptions , i was free to laugh myself silly at a completely unexpected delight . it's hard to say who may be more surprised at private parts -- stern's fans or his detractors -- because it is funny in almost every possible way : at times goofy and low key , at times undeniably outrageous . the savvy edge of private parts really should not have been a surprise considering betty thomas was in the director's chair . thomas previously did sharp work with the brady bunch movie and hbo's talk show wars docu-comedy the late shift , proving herself adept with the worlds of media and pop culture , and she manages to put a surprising amount of energy into scenes of people sitting around talking into microphones . some of those scenes are simply brilliant , including the attempt by a flustered kenny ( a wonderfully slimy performance by paul giamatti ) to stop stern's broadcast of an off-color parody of " match game . " thomas' most impressive achievement , however , may be taking a group of radio personalities -- including stern's cohorts robin quivers and fred norris -- and putting them in situations where they could be comfortable . norris in particular has some hilarious moments , notably in a sequence in a b-movie actress's hotel room where he steals every scene hardly saying a word . it may not be a tremendous challenge to make an acting debut playing yourself , but stern makes the character he plays something you might never expect : charming . probably not . there's certainly a contradiction between stern's announcement to alison prior to the emergence of the now-recognizable stern persona that he's going to " be myself , " and the disingenuous suggestion that he's just playing a character on the air ; the truth probably exists somewhere in the middle . it does grow a bit tiresome hearing howard bemoan how misunderstood he is , and the film slows down considerably whenever he feels obliged once again to show us his sensitive side . private parts is much funnier when stern laughs at himself , or when he does the things that make other people laugh at him . still , it's no easy trick to please stern's fans while placating his enemies , and private parts serves up raunchiness and bad taste in a slick and snappy package . no matter how much of howard stern you've seen , this is a howard stern you haven't seen . 
screenplay : tom jankewicz and d . v . devincentis & steve pink and john cusack . producers : susan arnold , donna arkoff roth and roger birnbaum . director : george armitage . grosse pointe blank has been bumped from hollywood pictures' release schedule a couple of times , but for once it appears that the delays had nothing to do with production over-runs or shabby quality . my guess is that the marketing people just kept asking for more time to figure out how in the world to sell this thing . when john cusack is your biggest star , the director's previous film ( miami blues ) was seen by next to no one seven years ago and the tone defies even its cute high-concept premise , you'd probably be stumped too . and no matter how they try to sell grosse pointe blank , they won't do it justice . grosse pointe blank is wildly unpredictable , wonderfully detailed and unapologetically intelligent , a comedy which takes the time to do the little things right and gets big laughs in the process . cusack plays martin blank , a killer-for-hire facing an existential crisis . john cusack is one of four credited writers for a script which boasts one of the characteristics of the best screen comedies : every minor character is a fully-realized comic creation . the exchanges between these characters are sharp and clever , rich with sometimes overlapping dialogue which actually requires the audience to pay attention . the punch lines never come quite when or how you expect them , taking deadly satirical aim at targets like organized labor , suburbia , assassin etiquette and that strange american ritual called the high school reunion . at the relatively calm center of this colorful comic hurricane is john cusack , who adds grosse pointe blank to an impressive resume of smart projects like say anything , the grifters , and bullets over broadway . his self-deprecating wit and baby-faced , sad-eyed attractiveness make him an instantly sympathetic screen presence , and cusack has to fight against his persona a bit to give martin the killer instinct he requires . the script gradually reveals bits of martin's history which explain how he became who he is , without sacrificing the comedy for an unnecessarily serious character study . it's a deft piece of acting by cusack , who has an easy chemistry with minnie driver ( in perhaps the least well-developed role ) which convincingly evokes a sense of history and familiarity . as absurd as the situations get in grosse pointe blank , the film never becomes a farce because cusack plays martin's quest for enlightenment as honest and honorable . . . even if he has to stab someone in the throat with a ball point pen along the way . oh , yes . . . grosse pointe blank could catch you off guard if you are unfamiliar with the aforementioned miami blues , director george armitage's under-appreciated 1990 thriller which wasn't timid about mixing comedy , quirky characters and occasionally graphic violence . grosse point blank is a much better , much funnier film , but it does include moments of violence which are sometimes jarring in an otherwise playful film ; martin is a killer , and we see him at work as well as at play . hollywood pictures isn't doing much to warn the squeamish about those elements , preferring instead to emphasize the comedy and a gen-x-nostalgic soundtrack heavy on 1980s punk and new wave tunes by the jam , the clash and others . a bit deceptive , perhaps , but for once i'm willing to forgive the marketing folks their trespasses if they get people into theaters to see grosse pointe blank . something this disarmingly unique needs all the creative salesmanship it can get . 
producers : martha delaurentiis and dino delaurentiis . director : jonathan mostow . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 95 minutes . even critics can fall into the same trap of equating the idea with the complete film . when a film with a familiar premise appears , you're likely to see dismissive reviews which perpetuate the notion that the real culprit is lack of originality , rather than lack of craft . of course , by those standards william shakespeare would be the most reviled plagiarist of all time -- how dare he steal his plots from antiquity , from english history , from other writers ? . a great idea works , but it can work more than once . it's the mark of a talented artist when he can take that recognizable idea and make it something original and exciting . take breakdown , for instance . the malevolent trucker and desert landscapes owe a debt to steven spielberg's duel , and there is a recognizably hitchockian quality to russell's ordinary guy in extraordinary circumstances . all of this might have left me shaking my head , if breakdown hadn't been so good at leaving me shaking all over . breakdown is as viscerally effective as any thriller hollywood has turned out in the last few years , because mostow understands what works . the hero is a slightly paunchy everyman , smart and resourceful enough for us to believe he has a chance at survival , and kurt russell does a nice job keeping the anger and determination from becoming one-note . the situation is just plausible and unnerving enough to get under your skin , with a creeping sense of paranoia which could affect the audience as much as it affects jeff . walsh in particular has the chilling ability to make a word into a weapon , and to make a stare as brutal as any of the pistol-whippings which permeate breakdown . over and above all that , mostow demonstrates a keen sense for how to construct a gripping , efficient thriller . the opening half hour is a subtle rumble of mounting dread , which in turn becomes a roller-coaster series of set pieces , which in turn becomes an all-stops-pulled finale , all in the course of 95 minutes . breakdown is most definitely intended as a crowd-pleaser , peppered as it is with frequent opportunities for the audience to cheer jeff turning the tables on his tormenters . it is also a remarkably effective crowd-pleaser , one which doesn't throw common sense or continuity to the wind for the sake of a punch line . by the time breakdown builds to a climactic four-car chase -- a somewhat excessive conclusion to an otherwise lean thriller -- mostow has demonstrated a rare talent for grabbing an audience and refusing to let go . there is another stolen idea in breakdown which isn't entirely mostow's doing . advertising for the film ominously warns " it could happen to you , " a nod to thrillers which became pop culture phenomena by appealing to our collective 20th-century conviction that every stranger is a serial killer waiting to happen -- call this one the " good samaritan truck driver from hell . " mostow actually goes a bit farther , playing the conflict in breakdown as class warfare , and it is disappointing to watch such a solid film resort to back-brain prejudices . if you think about breakdown long enough , you'll probably discover some things which bother you -- why , for instance , jeff didn't seem at all concerned about his wife riding with a stranger , or why the villains seem to thwart their own plan at the outset . you may even think about the fact that you've seen something like breakdown before . and it may not matter , because the idea is only the frame for a vehicle . jonathan mostow has given this one an engine with a heck of a kick . 
screenplay : susan streitfeld and julie hebert . director : susan streitfeld . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , sexual situations , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 115 minutes . those striking , androgynous features made her perfect for the gender-bending title role in 1993's orlando . in susan streitfeld's compelling character study , eve's psyche becomes the battleground between a hundred different social images of womanhood . watching that battle in swinton's face is , quite simply , electrifying . it's a great jumping-off point for a sociological study of modern american femininity , but streitfeld shows a peculiar and ill-advised devotion to her source . the film's most awkward conceit involves the periodic appearance of quotes from the book in odd locations -- embroidered into pillow-cases , as advertising on billboards and in magazines -- offering modestly insightful epigrams like " perverse scenarios are about desperate need . " it's a peter greenaway type of stunt from a rookie director ( streitfeld is a rehabilitated . . . sorry , those characters , and eve's interactions with them , really are the " plot " of female perversions . each one feels like something which began as a case study but grew into a unique and fully-realized individual . the performances -- by amy madigan , karen sillas , even paulina porizkova -- are uniformly superb , taking snapshots of different women coping with life and giving them unexpected vitality . it is a performance so rich and detailed that it feels like part of a documentary . and what a face it is . 
screenplay : victor nunez . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 115 minutes . if you can name two other peter fonda films since then , you have my deepest sympathies ; it probably means you sat through delights like wanda nevada . the broad forehead , the determined chin and the stoic demeanor are all eerily reminiscent of another film fonda . it's not just in his physical appearance that peter resembles papa henry . at first , helen's predicament does not move ulee in the least . one of the riskier steps writer/director victor nunez takes is making ulee fairly unlikeable at the outset , and not unlikeable in that fussy , irrascible but ultimately good-hearted hollywood way . like nunez's 1993 gem ruby in paradise , ulee's gold is about a journey of self-discovery , not exactly a high-concept premise . nunez's particular gift as both a writer and a director is the ability to convey the struggles of troubled souls without resorting to melodramatic situations or hyperbolic speeches . the most spectacular thing about peter fonda's performance is exactly that it is so unspectacular , a textbook study of dramatic economy . this stubborn , driven , hard-working man is not entirely pleasant to be around , but he's fascinating and thoroughly human . the action in fonda's lined face is more compelling than a shootout in the swamps . ulee's gold is exactly the kind of film some people get suspicious about when the critics go ga-ga , primarily because it is the kind of film critics are _expected_ to go ga-ga over . as a casually-paced , character-driven drama in the middle of summer , it certainly stands out in a crowd , but it is not a flawless masterpiece . nunez has a tendency to devote almost all his creative energy to his main character , leaving his supporting players far less to work with . there are moments when ulee's gold starts to wander , when the languid character interactions are merely slow instead of meaningful . still , one fascinating , carefully-constructed character is one more than almost any other film of the last few months has taken the time to give us . in a way , that makes ulee's gold just as rebellious a film as easy rider was in its time . 
screenplay : mike webb and michael colleary . director : john woo . mpaa rating : r ( violence , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 135 minutes . they don't wear masks of one another or impersonate one another -- they actually , physically exchange faces . the premise is , of course , absolutely ridiculous . it also is absolutely brilliant , and incredibly subversive . hollywood film-making is built around the idea of the star , around the idea that the audience is always and automatically on the side of the star . it's not necessary to write an interesting character for arnold schwarzenegger , because the people in the audience aren't expected to be rooting for the character . they're rooting for arnold schwarzenegger , the actor , the star . face/off , ridiculous though its premise might be , demands the creation of compelling characters . for the first forty minutes , john travolta plays sean archer , the tormented hero who has the audience's sympathy . the only way viewers can transfer their allegiance is if they spent the first forty minutes rooting for sean archer , not john travolta . to make face/off work , director john woo had to hand mike webb and michael colleary's sharp script to a couple of movie stars who could act , who could transcend persona for the demands of a dual role . both travolta and cage are in fine form in face/off , tearing up scenery with eye-popping relish when playing castor or seething with intensity as archer . of the two , cage has the greater challenge , and pulls off the more impressive transformation . travolta , meanwhile , proves that an action film with thematic depth can still be a whole lot of fun , riffing on cage's manic acting style and offering self-deprecating observations about his own " ridiculous chin . " woo delivers the kind of surging action summer movie-goers have come to expect , while adding touches they probably don't expect : evocative musical interludes , confident pacing and -- wonder of wonders -- an actual script . woo has always loved his action on a grand scale -- grand opera , actually -- but the final ten minutes of face/off are just a bit much , especially at the tail end of 135 minutes of running time . perhaps woo , who built a loyal following by filling his hong kong action films with stories of guilt , family ties and redemption , was so excited to be making this kind of film in america that he just didn't want it to end . he certainly pulls of a neat trick in face/off , investing a conventional genre with unconventional resonance . he also challenges the star system of 1990s hollywood with the revolutionary notion that an audience can invest itself emotionally in the characters in the story , not just the names above the title . calling a critic 'elitist' is like calling an accountant 'mathist .

the american ad campaign for the film places jackie in a heroic pose in front of spandex-clad , gun-toting babes , a pre-opening credits sequence sets the stage with a few impressive stunts , and the opening credits themselves are full of silhouette images . anything sound familiar ? imagine , now , that in the course of mimicking one of the most iconic adventure series of the last thirty years , someone managed to improve on it . when the creative force behind the result is jackie chan , it's not a tremendous stretch of the imagination . operation condor is simply the most ridiculously entertaining action film to grace american screens this year , a dazzling combination of energetic comedy and virtuoso stunt work which shames the multi-million dollar detritus offered this summer by hollywood studios . and none of it really matters in the least , except to the extent that it provides a set-up for action sequences . that structure doesn't distinguish it much from most late-model bond films , or from the majority of late-model action films of any make . what does distinguish operation condor is the action it delivers -- not just big , loud and expensive action but inventive , thrilling and beautifully choreographed action . a jackie chan fight sequence can do something absolutely extraordinary in the jaded age of the blockbuster : it makes action seem original . you may spend half of operation condor's running time -- particularly the spectacular wind tunnel finale -- wearing the goofy expression of someone who can't believe he just saw that . you may spend the other half enjoying the presence of chan himself , though the bond analogy certainly breaks down at this point . chan is a lot of things on screen , but suave ain't one of them . you get the feeling you'd be more likely to see him in a cardigan and slippers than in an armani tuxedo ; he's like mr . rogers if he could do a spinning back kick . ( my apologies , fred , if you _can_ do a spinning back kick . ) yet it is exactly that polite , boyish charm which makes chan such a great action hero . he's in on the absurd joke of action films , but not in the raised eyebrow , quip-spewing way which passes for wit in other genre entries . chan is willing simply to laugh at himself , at the idea of a vulnerable nice guy who defeats his opponents with grace and style rather than with an uzi . there are a few clumsy transitions in operation condor , many the result of editing which trimmed almost twenty minutes from the original cut of armour of god ii , as well as predictably stiff supporting performances and grossly caricatured accents in the dubbed voices . operation condor is _fun_ , fun in a way which should make people embarrassed for using the same word to describe con air or the lost world . if i were pierce brosnan , i'd be looking over my shoulder right about now . chan . calling a critic 'elitist' is like calling an accountant 'mathist .

when people learn in social settings that i am a film critic , two inevitable questions arise . the first -- " so what's good ? " -- is always a pleasure to answer ; in fact , telling people what's good is the purest pleasure in this job . unfortunately , many of my recommendations are unfamiliar to casual movie-goers , which begs the second , more aggravating question : " so what's it about ? " it seems simple enough , a harmless request for a thumbnail sketch of the plot , but it also asks one to strip a film down to the single sentence you might find in a " tv guide " summary . i would then refuse to let the individual walk away until i explained that ponette isn't really " about " a grieving little girl , that it's not the maudlin drama full of teary-eyed waifs that such a hopelessly under-descriptive synopsis might portend . at turns genuinely touching and delightfully amusing , ponette is really about that point in childhood where every question has a hundred different answers . little ponette's question seems to her to be a very straightforward one -- she simply wants to know how she can talk to her mother again . the truth writer/director jacques doillon mines is that , between the well-intentioned happy talk and half-truths of adults and the ill-informed " facts " of peers , it's a wonder that children learn anything about life's complicated questions . childhood at this age may never have been portrayed with more grace , humor or startling realism , from the spectacular performances of the young actors ( none better than the mesmerizing thivisol ) to doillon's plucked-from-preschool script . doillon's insights are so honest for so long that his conclusion , involving a supernatural visitation , comes as a real disappointment . it's too obvious and too pedantic a resolution to a film which is built around the absence of easy answers . there are no simple questions in ponette , no even a question so apparently simple as , " so what's it about ?

long before its release , fox's anastasia was greeted with some strangely familiar skeptical remarks . " the execution of the romanovs ? " " not exactly the stuff for an animated film , is it ? " similar words greeted disney's pocahontas a couple of years ago , and that film went on to take a criticaly pasting for not being enough " fun . " journalists and studios have formed an odd tag-team perpetuating the notion that an animated film with adult subject matter is just a waste of time between the happy meal characters . while television has produced smart animation for grown-ups like " the simpsons , " " king of the hill , " " dr . it's like folks don't like their cartoons gettin' uppity . anastasia is not , i repeat , _not_ a great film for kids . it is , however , a visually rich and extremely well-constructed story which shows a little nerve . at its least inventive , anastasia attempts merely to follow the successful disney plan for animated features . most of the comic relief shows up during rasputin's scenes , yet they also hinder the narrative . the villain doesn't contribute to anastasia's most interesting elements ; he's around because , darn it , you've _got_ to have a villain around in an animated film . that assumption is based on the " kids first " paradigm , one which anastasia doesn't follow most of the time . the characterizations of anya and dmitri are effective without being over-wrought ; their developing relationship is sketched out in smart , subtle scenes . the character animation seems somehow richer than most of disney's recent efforts , giving the characters more life ( anya's unconventional features are worth extra attention ) . yet anastasia may be most intriguing because , unlike disney's features , it feels like a genuine _musical_ , not simply a film with songs attached . when anastasia breaks into song , it's like you're watching an ambitious stage production . it also comes with an unusual but dynamic animation style which combines conventional hand-drawn characters with computer-generated backgrounds . though the juxtapositions don't always work , the effect is stunning when they do . anastasia also serves up a few genuinely creepy images , the kinds you'd associate with ralph bakshi more than with uncle walt . though disney has managed to make a couple of films as satisfying for parents as they were for their children ( beauty and the beast , for certain ) , no recent disney film has felt quite as mature as anastasia . fox , quite predictably , is still marketing anastasia as a family film , and there's not exactly anything which would be considered objectionable . it just seems a shame that anastasia _had_ to become a children's film when this material could have been turned into a spectacular drama unencumbered by cute puppies or talking bats . it's time for someone to take a look at the ratings for television's animation for grown-ups and take a chance . come on , we can handle it . after all , we're not kids any more . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
producers : stephen evans and david parfitt . director : iain softley . mpaa rating : r ( sexual situations , nudity ) running time : 101 minutes . it also makes wings a particularly intriguing addition to her resume . like most of her previous films , this one is a costume drama based on a classic novel ( by henry james ) . those tense interpersonal dynamics are rendered with impressive economy in hossein amini's screenplay . the wings of the dove comes in at under an hour and 45 minutes , a remarkable achievement for a literary adaptation made even more remarkable by the richness of the characterizations . the requisite sumptuous production values are all in place ( notably john beard's spectacular production design ) , yet the wings of the dove never once sacrifices focus on the characters for fetishistic period detail . merton's background is less focused than the rest , but linus roache creates a convincing portrait of torn loyalties ; as millie , alison elliott plays the doomed millie with a tenderness of spirit which never lapses into cinematic sainthood . both roache and elliott are strong , but helena bonham carter is a powerhouse . her performance pulses with resentment and rationalized deviousness , captured by iain softley in direction which holds on her face whenever possible . the potentially unsympathetic character of kate becomes a tragic figure who feels forced into plotting for her most basic happiness . how very fitting . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : james cameron . director : james cameron . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , sexual situations , violence , profanity ) running time : 195 minutes . titanic , the perfectionist auteur's baby which missed its summer release date . titanic , the entertainment industry headline . not titanic , the movie . . . titanic , the _story_ . it's hard for a film to crawl out from under that kind of baggage , so give james cameron all the credit in the world : for nearly half the film's running time , i forgot that i was watching _that_ titanic . only the jealous cal -- and an inconvenient iceberg -- can stand in the way of their love . dicaprio and winslet share an extraordinary chemistry , two charismatic young actors with mischievous eyes who create a tangibly passionate pairing . though most of the characters around them are more functional than fleshed-out , particularly billy zane's sneering patrician , the two stars likely would have overwhelmed all comers regardless of their multi-dimensionality . this may be the year's most effective and consistently entertaining love story . oh , and it's also about a big boat going belly-up . those who come for the sinking rather than the swooning aren't likely to be disappointed with the spectacle cameron offers . his obsession with historical accuracy begins with the dazzling duplication of the ship's lavish decor and ends with a virtually real-time re-creation of its journey to the bottom of the atlantic . titanic is an impressively-mounted disaster movie during its second half , but it's still basically a disaster movie . once the ship is down , and the lovers once again have time to share a powerful , quiet moment , it becomes clear that the large-scale drama can't match the small-scale drama . people will want to go see titanic simply to see what a $200 million movie looks like . and it looks great , rich in period detail and sweeping views of cameron's massive scale-model titanic . more important than how it looks , though , is how it feels . it feels like it has a heart , real emotion powering the narrative in a way dollar signs can't . somewhere past the headlines , the gossip , the turmoil and the accounting details is a magnificent piece of epic film-making . it's time for titanic , the movie , to sink or swim on its own impressive merits . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : atom egoyan , based on the novel by russell banks . producers : atom egoyan and camelia frieberg . director : atom egoyan . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , adult themes , profanity ) running time : 112 minutes . it's not often that a film inspires me to use the adjective " sublime , " but there's no better word to describe what atom egoyan has accomplished in the sweet hereafter . most films about tragic subjects appear to be driven by a fear that emotions writ small will leave an audience hungry for grand catharsis , so they attack with teary-eyed embraces and a swelling john williams score . egoyan refuses to turn on a warning light when he's about to go for your emotions . no other approach could have worked the same mournful , hypnotic magic egoyan delivers in the sweet hereafter . well , like most things in atom egoyan films , the obvious answer usually isn't the right one . through a masterful use of overlapping and interwoven time frames , egoyan gradually reveals details about the characters which cloud every motivation . egoyan's story-telling demands that you pay attention , forces you to draw conclusions , and allows you to feel without telling you _how_ to feel . he's also a director who can startle you with his confident refusals to make the obvious choice . nowhere is this more evident than his depiction of the bus accident itself . the moment is gripping and devastating in a completely unpredictable way because of what we see , what we don't see , and the context in which it is framed . egoyan portrays the deep , powerful and often illogical emotions of parenthood from several different perspectives , each one performed to perfection , each one with different wrenching consequences . one of egoyan's riskier choices is also one of the few which doesn't pay off . several scenes in the sweet hereafter are accompanied by nicole reading passages from " the pied piper of hamelin , " an extended metaphor which grows less effective each time it's used . on screen , with the persistence of a voice , the comparison occasionally feels forced ; i can imagine the device working much more effectively in the russell banks novel on which the film is based ( and which i haven't read ) , as an entry or exit point to a chapter . the sweet hereafter is still a remarkably literary film in the best sense of the word , perhaps the most novel-like film since john sayles' lone star . what egoyan adds cinematically -- from mychael danna's otherworldly score to the ambiguity-enhancing final shot -- turns the sweet hereafter into one of the year's most powerful works . and , in all probability , the most sublime . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
i have heard their decisions to pledge defended with terms like " service , " " networking , " or " fellowship . " however , the most brutally honest explanation i've ever heard comes from one unnamed student in the sundance grand prize winning documentary frat house : " it's about finding the people you enjoy getting f * * * * * d up with most . " it aroused my interest enough that i was disappointed to find that issue unexplored , but ultimately todd phillips and andrew gurland's goal was to show _what_ people join when they join fraternities and sororities . however , though their footage of hazing , strippers , binge-drinking and humiliation has " expose' " written all over it , i'd be lying if i said i was surprised by anything i saw in frat house . i saw enough in my own college days to reach the point where nothing a drunken , misogynistic 19-year-old does or says will shock me . what _is_ shocking and surprising is the fact that phillips and gurland were able to capture this behavior on film . while frat house is certainly a testemonial to male bonding at its ugliest , it may be even more effective as a testemonial to the determination of the film-makers . there was one other condition as well : the film-makers themselves would be obliged to go through everything the pledges went through . never has the pain of creating a film gelled as smoothly with the subject of the film itself . it doesn't do justice to the quality of frat house as a piece of film-making to focus entirely on the hard work of phillips and gurland . their instincts for making their subject entertaining are impressive , notably in a hilarious juxtaposition of one sorority's " hell night " ( composed primarily of sobbing through a lyrically-amended version of " through the years " ) with the fraternal equivalent . frat house is worth watching not just because the subject matter is sensational , though that may draw some concerned parents . its real achievement is creating a record of the kind of ridiculous , frightening and grimly hysterical behavior everyone already knows goes on college campuses across the country ; it's the realest " real world " episode you'll ever see . credit phillips and gurland with going the extra mile to show that reality to the world . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
director : steven soderbergh . no previous adaptation of an elmore leonard novel -- and there have been a couple of pretty good ones recently in get shorty and jackie brown -- has captured the author's unique flavor as effectively as out of sight . though leonard usually writes about criminal characters , he doesn't exactly write crime novels ; though his stories are often quite funny , he doesn't exactly write comic novels ; though his narratives always come together in a way that makes sense , he doesn't exactly let tight plotting get in the way of an amusing tangent . leonard is his own literary animal : sometimes sordid , sometimes smirking , always sly . you'll find every one of those contradictions and then some in out of sight , a marvelously meandering caper with rhythms all its own . surprisingly , the ride proves intriguing to both parties . out of sight certainly works best as a quirky comedy , with screenwriter scott frank ( who also adapted get shorty ) providing great material for a superb supporting cast . steve zahn steals every one of his scenes as jack and buddy's perpetually stoned accomplice glenn , channeling crispin glover with considerably more appealing goofiness . there are even a couple of sharp unbilled cameos , including michael keaton reprising his jackie brown character and a final-scene appearance by another veteran of a previous leonard adaptation . good scripts make even mediocre actors look better ; frank's script in the hands of these actors is a hilarious gem . but out of sight isn't just a comedy . it's also a love story , if a very odd one . clooney has never looked more comfortable or charismatic on the big screen , nor has lopez , for that matter . with a clever nod to the fast-attraction nature of film romances ( in a reference to the redford-dunaway thriller three days of the condor ) , out of sight gets maximum mileage out of the pairing of its stars in a believable fast-attraction film romance . there are also plenty of crime caper elements mixed in with the comedy and romance , including no small amount of bloodshed , but even then the film seems entirely cohesive . credit director steven soderbergh with crafting a distinctive , unifying look and feel from frank's deftly back-tracking script . most frequently he employs an abrupt freeze-framing device , usually to mark transitions between scenes and locations . in soderbergh's capable hands the freeze-frames never feel gimmicky , instead playing as chapter stops on leonard's snappy punch lines . there's nothing particularly deep or intensely memorable about out of sight -- indeed , the pace flags a bit at times as it tries to keep up with all its characters -- but it's the kind of film that punches holes in the notion that " entertaining " and " smart " are mutually exclusive adjectives for a summer film . this is pure pulp pleasure , the cinematic equivalent of great beach reading . . . and what better way is there to describe the work of elmore leonard ? see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : ed decter & john j . strauss and peter farrelly & bobby farrelly . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult humor , sexual situations , brief nudity ) running time : 115 minutes . i'll worry tomorrow about whether i've consigned myself to film critic hell ; today , i'm still waiting for my cheeks and sides to recover . i'll worry tomorrow about whether or not the farrelly brothers portend the end of civilization as we know it ; today , i'm still grateful someone is willing to push the comedic envelope into heretofore unknown zip codes . tomorrow i many not believe i've sent the following words to an unsuspecting world : today , i believe there's something about mary is the funniest comedy i've seen in this decade . it may also be the most consistently , unapologetically tasteless comedy i've seen this decade . never mind . the plot is really beside the point . there's something about mary is really a collection of comedy-of-errors set pieces which find gags in the mentally handicapped , the physically handicapped , stalking , masturbation , anonymous homosexual encounters , serial killings and the unspeakable horror of getting . . . " it " . . . caught in one's zipper . if that kind of subject matter seems more likely to have you grimacing than guffawing , don't say i didn't warn you : there's even more where that came from . viewers with less delicate sensibilities , on the other hand , may be hoarse at the end of a relentlessly raucous two hours . it's unfair to spoil the moments with specifics ; half the fun in there's something about mary comes from i-can't-believe-they-did-that reactions . suffice to say that nearly everything works , from the surrealist use of alt-rock icon jonathan richman as the film's narrator/troubadour to the subverted romantic montage , from the perfectly-pitched charm of diaz ( rapidly becoming the most appealing screen actress of her generation , if she's not there already ) to the goofy appeal of stiller . there's something about mary recalls blazing saddles-era mel brooks , or airplane ! -era zucker-abrahams-zucker -- back-brain humor which will be as dumb and/or offensive to some viewers as it is hilarious to others . brilliant , it ain't ; brilliantly executed , it is . there are a couple of slow patches in there's something about mary , which probably runs longer than advisable at nearly two hours . when it pauses long enough to pretend that the character relationships matter , or to explain a rather unnecessary plot twist , the film could have you shifting in your seat . fortunately , they're only momentary distractions between laughs that beat down your logical objections , building and building until they add up to more laughs than you can remember at the movies . i'm not proud of the fact that i'd rather sit through there's something about mary again than any one of the inspid romantic comedies of the past five years that generally passed for comic entertainment , but i would . i'll worry about what that means tomorrow . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
director : jonathan demme . mpaa rating : r ( adult themes , nudity , sexual situations , violence ) running time : 172 minutes . beloved doesn't feel like a typical oscar-hyped fall " prestige release , " full of cathartic emotion and earnest dignity . its opening minutes portend something quite different : two silent exterior shots , one tracking through a graveyard and the other establishing a rural ohio home , shift to a scene of sheer supernatural terror . so much for earnest dignity ; this is a prestige release as american gothic horror film . that shouldn't be terribly surprising coming from director jonathan demme , who turned 1991's the silence of the lambs into an oscar-winning prestige release . yet this is no more a conventional thriller than it is a conventional epic drama , though it incorporates elements of both . it's what beloved does with the idea of a ghost story that made toni morrison's novel so powerful , and makes demme's film so gripping . most film-makers would have taken those events and shown them off with sincere indignation . the images created by demme and cinematographer tak fujimoto are jittery and chilling , designed more to invade the sub-conscious than to inspire tight-lipped head-shaking . with oprah winfrey effectively conveying sethe's hollow-eyed resignation , beloved shows how a tormented past can corrupt the present to the point that it feels perpetually haunted , holding meaning only as a constant reminder of unforgettable evils . if beloved had intended merely to shock and dismay , it would have been a very shallow and disspiriting experience . instead , it becomes a call to the living to dare existing in the present , conveyed through two supporting characters marvelously performed . beloved is such a side-ranging story that it's bound to feel slightly disjointed at times . the flashback to sethe's escape from sweet home feels particularly drawn out , slowing down a nearly three-hour film . it's impressive , however , that three different screenwriters could create so cohesive an adaptation . there is emotion , yes , and dignity ; there is also evil , and even horror . i can only think of one way to categorize a film like beloved : it may be the most uplifting horror film you'll ever see . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : andrew stanton and donald mcenery & bob shaw . producers : darla k . anderson and kevin reher . directors : john lasseter and andrew stanton . mpaa rating : g . running time : 95 minutes . a bug's life deserves better . it deserves better than to be held up to that other computer-animated insect film from earlier this fall . it deserves better than to be compared to that other feature from pixar . it's virtually impossible to talk about a bug's life without invoking antz and/or toy story , but it deserves better . films with this much wit , energy and imagination are too uncommon to diminish this one with such petty comparisons . a bug's life is not just a delightful computer-animated family film about insects . it's a delightful film . not that it's a perfect one . the botched circus sequence in which they are introduced recalls warner bros . cartoons at their most rapid-fire anarchic , with the cast of colorful performers all delivering laughs . though foley is a pleasant enough presence , his redemption storyline isn't nearly as interesting as the circus performers' search for an adoring audience . he serves much the same function here as he does on tv's " newsradio , " acting as the sane center around which more charismatic characters can do their thing . he's also the center around which the animators can do their thing , and they do more than enough things to make for a wonderful ride . the throwaway gags in flik's visit to the " big city " -- an annoying street mime mimicking flik's every move , a cricket panhandler with a sign announcing " wings pulled off by kids " -- are consistently appealing to viewers of all ages . director john lasseter has an uncanny eye for setting up a scene , and a comic sensibility most directors of live action should be willing to kill for . nowhere is that more evident than during the closing credits , when lasseter pulls out the kind of brilliant conceit that makes really good films feel like great films . miss the final five minutes at your own peril . sure , it would have been nice if a bug's life had had a story as tightly constructed as the buddy bonding of woody and buzz in toy story . it would have been nice if the lead character had had as distinctive a personality as woody allen's z in antz . those are the nit-picking details you have to come up with when a film offers as much pure fun as a bug's life . silly enough for kids , smart enough for adults , grandly-staged enough for anyone who loves movies , it offers entertainment that deserves a different kind of comparison . understand that there probably haven't been a half-dozen better films of _any_ kind this year , and you'll be on to the kind of comparison a bug's life really deserves . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : todd solondz . director : todd solondz . mpaa rating : not rated ( sexual situations , adult themes , profanity ) . running time : 135 minutes . happiness is almost too difficult to watch -- not because of its potentially shocking content , but because it's so achingly sad . stabs at romance turn into depressing one-night stands . the dozen or so principal characters in todd solondz's bleakly funny suburban nightmare fumble and fail so consistently in their pursuit of happiness you might suspect it was unattainable . and , in the sense that some of them define it , it is . solondz fills his world with people who want what they haven't got , never realizing how much it could cost them . baker gives bill so many layers that he always seems human even through his predatory calculation . his attempt to cajole billy's young friend into eating a drugged sandwich is as pathetic as it is creepy , his parental concern as genuine as it is tainted . solondz is never merely interested in the sensationalistic but trite notion that the monsters who turn up in headlines are our neighbors . it's even more unsettling that solondz sets bill at one far end of a continuum of pain selfishly inflicted in the desperate search for fulfillment . there are no grand enlightenments in happiness , which may make it seem that solondz is simply reveling in the characters' degradation . the fact is they're merely deeply flawed , some making small steps towards defining their own happiness , others too immersed in external definitions to be ready for those small steps . solondz's one real mis-step -- aside from the unnecessarily long running time -- involves a murder/rape sub-plot which launches happiness into an unnecessarily surreal direction . the film doesn't need the cheap laughs from references to cut up body parts in freezer bags , not when it offers edgy humor that's so much more uncomfortably genuine . it's brutally ironic that he's asking for advice on normalcy from a man who may be nobody's paradigm of normalcy , but at least he's receiving reassurance that he's not alone in his confusion . solondz turns what could have been a freak show into a reassurance that we , too , are not alone in being something other than " normal .

director : anthony drazan . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , drug use , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 123 minutes . eddie ( sean penn ) , a second-tier hollywood player , is slowly realizing that hollywood is a bad place to be if you feel things too deeply . his life is a hurlyburly -- emotional turbulence occasionally interrupted by attempts at communication that come out " blah blah blah . " it's always in fashion to take a stab at the shallow white underbelly of tinseltowners , but hurlyburly -- adapted by david rabe from his play -- offers more than cheap shot industry-bashing . at its heart it's a study of a man who has set himself up for perpetual disappointment by being tempermentally incompatible with the people who surround him . it's a riveting performance as one of the best-written characters of the year . david rabe's writing has the familiar rhythm of another playwright named david -- mamet -- giving the dialogue the snap of exchanged gunfire . hurlyburly always feels like a film adaptation of a stage play , with the action centered at all times on character interaction , which is not to say that it's static or visually uncompelling . this is certainly a piece for actors above all , with a uniformly stellar cast -- be prepared to be surprised by meg ryan in a small role as a stripper -- but it's not a film where the camera sets up simply for people to deliver monologues . hurlyburly feels like its setting : smooth and slick , with something dark bubbling just underneath . it's easy to get caught up in one element of a film's tone , particularly if previous films on a similar subject have led you to expect that sort of tone . yes , hurlyburly is dark -- there are unhappy people who spend most of their time swearing , snorting or debasing other unhappy people , there is violence , and there is death . there are moments of raw emotion that come from unexpected places and take unexpected forms . and there is the hope that a man can remember how to care . those who see this as just another nihilistic stroll down hollywood boulevard aren't looking closely enough . hurlyburly may be talky , but the talk isn't cheap . that shallow white underbelly has rarely run this deep . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
wes anderson has the kind of comic sensibility that keeps you watching just so you can see where he goes next . though the humor was often absurd , anderson and his co-writer owen wilson never sacrificed character for the sake of an easy joke . it's that same sensibility that makes rushmore such a quirky delight -- it's a uniquely oddball comedy that's still about people . it would have been easy enough for anderson to turn rushmore into an ever-escalating , bigger-must-be-funnier battle of pranks . like a typical teen , max is concerned with how others see him ; unlike a typical teen , his concern manifests itself in an obsession with grand gestures , with being perceived as important . as splendidly portrayed by first-time actor schwartzman , max's egomaniacal infatuations -- first with the school and then with miss cross -- come off as the sweetly immature behavior of a kid trying way too hard to appear mature . there's plenty immature about herman blume as well , imbued with an aura of pure defeat by bill murray . though the destructive salvos exchanged by max and blume are wonderfully funny , they're also ridiculous because of the players involved : a kid working desperately to be an adult , and an adult working desperately to be a kid . you in the sh * t ? " ) , combining for one of the smartest comedies you'll see . anderson and wilson do bite off perhaps a few too many plot threads -- the friendship between max and his young rushmore " chapel buddy " ( mason gamble ) doesn't really go anywhere -- but there are so many deft comic touches that the less interesting elements are somehow diluted . at its core , the narrative of rushmore is quite conventional stuff about people who learn important lessons about what they want from life . those lessons are given such a singular presentation that you may only realize after you've stopped laughing that these people , for all their foolishness , are all the more appealing because they're real . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
the castle is the kind of comedy that never could have been made in hollywood . scratch that -- it could have been made in hollywood , but it would have been a disaster . the use of a voice-over narrator would have turned into a crutch instead of a source of inspired brilliance . the working class characters might have been either salt-of-the-earth or grotesque , but never the perfect blend of both . the tale of a little guy fighting the system would have been wrapped up by a wildly cheering courtroom gallery , instead of a delightfully profane two-word summation . and the neat and tidy 82-minute running time would have been bloated by another 15 or 20 minutes . it matters little to darryl that the house is built on landfill next to the airport -- it's his home , his pride and joy , his castle . it's no small task to laugh _with_ a collection of characters and laugh _at_ them at the same time , but that's exactly what sitch and his three co-writers have accomplished . sitch turns the smiling bad taste of the kerrigans into perfectly-pitched comedy . yet it is exactly that skewed perspective that makes the castle so endearing even as it sends you rolling on the floor with laughter . michael caton's pitch-perfect performance as darryl is a portrait of brighter-side-looking that re-defines the term . it's a performance so warm that anyone who might look condescendingly at the kerrigans should feel ashamed . a man's love for what he has -- rather than envy of what he doesn't have -- has rarely felt this genuine . yet the film is never really about that battle in the way that you'd expect . there are some marvelous comic moments as darryl takes on his adversaries , but the richness of the castle comes from the fact that his victory is one of perspective even before a verdict is read . sure , in some ways it's a one-joke film , and perhaps some viewers will grow weary of that one joke . it just happens to be a joke told with the kind of skill we just don't see very often . an audience trained what to expect from comedies by hollywood will find expectations in this down under comedy turned -- most appropriately -- upside-down . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
director : david fincher . mpaa rating : r ( violence , gore , profanity , sexual situations , nudity ) running time : 139 minutes . in this year of our lord 1999 , when all things millennial are hotter than the coming apocalyptic purges , i give you david fincher -- official filmmaker of the dark night of our collective 21st century soul . seven was one of the decade's most chilling visions of societal madness made flesh ; the game turned existential crisis into engrossing suspense . no one in popular culture seems to understand our demons better . no one more effectively shows the deceptive ease with which our stable world can be yanked out from under us . in his adaptation of chuck palahniuk's savagely brilliant novel fight club , fincher delves once again into the bowels of our uber-psyche -- quite literally in the propulsive , dust brothers-scored opening credits sequence -- and announces that a lot of us are walking very close to the edge . it might surprise a lot of people to discover that fight club is actually a comedy . certainly it's not a comedy in the big daddy or mickey blue eyes sense , and not just because this one is actually funny . it's a comedy like a clockwork orange was a comedy , a social satire so caustic you laugh with a sharp intake of breath . norton's wonderfully dry narration includes dozens of scathing punch lines , many of them drawn directly from palahniuk's text . and it had to be ; there's no other way to tell a story like fight club without wallowing in didacticism . many critics and social conservatives have already offered up kill-the-messenger diatribes against the film's brutality and anarchist sub-plots , yet another depressing reminder that some people need their messages delivered to them in solemn " isn't this a very , very bad thing " tones . at its heart , fight club is a warning about the percolating discontent that has exploded into well-publicized acts of violence in this country . it also peeks into the capacity for violent action we may not even realize we possess , the testosterone id bubbling beneath the veneer of civilization . if the approach to those subjects had ever become overtly preachy , fight club would have become a glossy social science dissertation -- a big screen version of susan faludi's emasculated-american-male study " stiffed . " instead , fight club taps into something primal , then takes it into the realm of the absurd -- subliminal penises , liposuction soap and all . weaving it all together is fincher , as distinctive and unconventional a filmmaker as any working in mainstream theatrical films . fight club is a kinetic work with plenty of visual flourishes and jolting sound design , yet it never feels like an all-out sensory pummeling -- it's the film oliver stone probably wanted natural born killers to be , but lacked the subtlety to pull of . the film only sags during a late surge of exposition , a necessary evil that still feels awkward . when fincher is allowed to plunge into fight club's dizzying array of themes and subtexts , the result is as provocatively entertaining a film as you could hope for . if the violence unnerves -- or becomes even more unnerving when accompanied by vicious wit -- that's only because it should . fight club keeps you off balance , its incendiary vision leavened by the unexpected humor . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay/director : steven soderbergh . it's called the sophomore slump , and it's a pitfall common to all contemporary art forms . a writer has a lifetime to create the breakthrough debut , and eighteen months to create a follow-up everyone will expect to be equally good ; as just the most recent cinematic example , witness john singleton's poetic justice . if this is true of soderbergh , the evidence that this is one auteur with staying power is king of the hill , a beautiful and darkly poetic adaptation of a . e . hotchner's memoir of life during the great depression . king of the hill's greatest triumph is one of tone . as somber as the subject matter could have been , soderbergh opts neither for grittiness nor spielbergian sentimentality . none of the empire's residents are treated as pathetic or heroic ; they're simply decent people trying to do their best with what they've been given . there is as much humor as their is sadness in king of the hill , perhaps more . all are lovingly photographed by elliot davis and accented by a giddy cliff martinez score reminiscent of randy newman . to be certain , this isn't an entirely pleasant film ; there are some dark and bittersweet moments . however , the balance is maintained so that it feels ( at the risk of sounding cliche ) like life . the splendid ensemble cast only adds to the richness . heading the list is bradford , perfectly cast as the imaginative aaron . he manages to capture both a savvy born of necessity and pubescent awkwardness with understated style . of the hotel's denizens , i was particularly taken with amber benson as ella , who conveys a heartfelt desperation for contact that generates some touching scenes with aaron . also worth noting is karen allen in an appealing turn as aaron's supportive teacher . i have no frame of reference for the historical accuracy of king of the hill , but i do know that it * felt * real . there are also intriguing character types , particularly the fascistic beat cop who treats his street like a fiefdom . in short , king of the hill feels like a man's vivid memory of a difficult but enriching boyhood , told with power and grace . soderbergh has a gift for visual narrative , and it makes for an outstanding film . third time is a charm steven . keep it up . 
director : david lynch . mpaa rating : g ( mild profanity ) running time : 111 minutes . in most exceptional films , there is a moment early on when you can just tell you're tapped into something special . where we see alvin's puttering rig about 100 yards from where we last saw it . i think that shot might have been one of the best of the year even if its only purpose had been as a shaggy dog joke . but it's more than that ; it's a remarkably efficient tone-setter . instantly , you know this is going to be a rather unique travelogue . you can begin to appreciate the truly inspired combination of freddie francis's cinematography and angelo badalamenti's fiddle-and-guitar road music that makes the straight story so evocative in its heartland sincerity . and you understand that slow , methodical persistence is central to this story's success -- not just in alvin's journey , but in lynch's willingness to ask his audience for some patience as the film unfolds . if you're busy rubbing your eyes incredulously , wondering if we could possibly be talking about the same david lynch who made " twin peaks , " blue velvet and lost highway , let me assure you that we are . we're also talking about the same david lynch who made the elephant man , another fact-based story overflowing with compassion and humanity . there may be something about working from real life that keeps lynch anchored , and it's a style that suits him well . as provocative as his more surreal films have been , they can make it difficult to appreciate what a talented director he is between the cringes and the head-scratching . in the straight story , he is more in command of his simple visual storytelling than he has ever been , which is not necessarily saying that the straight story is his best film . it's simply obvious , with none of the grotesquerie characteristic of other lynch films , that he knows exactly what works for any given story . he also knows that the straight story is more than a bunch of pretty pictures of the american midwest . richard farnsworth's performance is so low-key and naturalistic that it may not seem there's a lot going on , but alvin straight is a superbly crafted character . senior citizens rarely get the kind of showcase the straight story provides , and farnsworth does beautiful things with alvin . farnsworth does a fine job of pulling all possible sanctimony out of those scenes , but the film is still stronger when it's quiet and observant , soaring on the skills of francis and badalamenti . there's also a sly sense of humor to the straight story , including lynch's ability to poke fun at himself . it's exactly the kind of scene where lynch might have dipped into the creatures beneath the green lawn , or found some other bit of suburban horror . in the striaght story , he just tells a straight story , finding poetry in the simple reliability of a lawnmower's slow , steady journey . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : andrew stanton , rita hsiao , doug chamberlin & chris webb . producers : helene plotkin and karen robert jackson . director : john lasseter . mpaa rating : g running time : 85 minutes . there is no finer comic filmmaker working today than john lasseter . no one better understands how to choreograph an elaborate sight gag ; no one better nails the timing of comic dialogue . combine these elements with a genuine warmth and love of character , and you have one of the closest things we have to a pop culture genius in american cinema circa 1999 . incidentally , john lasseter directs computer-generated films . if you think that qualification renders such praise moot , shame on you for your short-sightedness . movies just don't get much more blissfully , intelligently entertaining than toy story and a bug's life , and i didn't think it would be possible for a sequel to approach toy story's heights of savvy family filmmaking . once again , lasseter has broadened my thinking . when you're dealing with a film like toy story 2 , it's easy to spend far too much time talking about the technology and the referrential gags . yes , the technology has improved by orders of magnitude even over the original toy story , making human characters like al an even more seamless part of the film , and making possible some dizzying , dazzling action sequences . it's a film that easily could have cruised on its cutting edge , its hipness and the good will of familiar faces . toy story soared not because it was revolutionary , but because it was a marvelously told film story -- a more human story than 90% of all films actually involving humans . the kidnap/rescue structure of toy story 2 may seem familiar , but this film may actually be a bit more resonant than the original . leave it to lasseter to turn a family film into a meditation on love : behind the pure entertainment , there's a story about broken hearts and the risks of potentially transient relationships . and in front of those themes , there's pure entertainment . it's true that toy story 2 is somewhat busier than the original , with a few too many characters to keep up with . some of the additional story elements -- like buzz encountering a naive , fresh-out-of-the-box version of himself in the toy store -- are fun but occasionally distracting . this may not be the instant classic toy story was , but it's too close to quibble . there is so much here that's delightful in so many ways , you begin to realize what movies are supposed to be , yet so rarely are : transporting experiences . i'm sure many filmmakers would love the absolute control over their movie universe -- every blink , every blade of grass -- that john lasseter has over his . i'm equally sure most of them wouldn't have a clue what to do with it . a computer , as the cliche goes , is just a tool . it takes a visionary like john lasseter to turn it into a magic wand . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
the talented mr . director : anthony minghella . mpaa rating : r ( violence , brief nudity , profanity , adult themes ) running time : 135 minutes . for the life of me , i don't know why any film-maker would take on the thankless task of literary adaptation . if he is too scrupulously faithful ( see : angela's ashes ) , he risks creating a narrative without its own identity as a film . you don't want to infuriate fans of the source material ( paul verhoeven's starship troopers ) , and you don't want to sacrifice a unique artistic perspective just to get every detail right ( the green mile ) . it is , simultaneously , a can't-miss and a can't-win proposition . if anthony minghella feels that pressure , he sure doesn't show it . he squeezed and compacted the english patient's complex narrative , and came up with a beautiful old-fashioned romantic drama . ripley , he has completely re-made the story's titular morally-ambiguous protagonist . the result may give purists fits , but it's a strangely invigorating piece of psychological suspense . tom , however , finds dickie's life of expatriate revelry far too fascinating to be concerned with much besides ingratiating himself into it -- by any means necessary . minghella's ripley turns tom into something far more than an admittedly fascinating portrait of amorality . minghella combines this twisty characterization with direction that occasionally leans too heavily on visual metaphor . the cues can feel a bit heavy-handed , but minghella can also stage scenes where tension appears in unexpected ways -- a shouted confession unheard , a lingering moment caught in the space between two lies . it's one thing to direct actors well , which minghella certainly does here ( philip seymour hoffman is particularly fine as an icily condescending ugly american ) . it's rarer to find someone who can find all the right notes in character interaction , from the turn of a phrase to the placement of an uncomfortable silence . many viewers are likely to be put off by the talented mr . ripley's less-than-tidy conclusion , which serves as a bookend to the film's arresting opening shot . of course , that's just one of the many ways that anthony minghella risks losing his audience . his interpretation of the talented mr . ripley is undeniably a departure from highsmith , but it's a departure that works the way any thoughtful re-interpretation can work . the talented mr . minghella has fashioned a seductive , sad portrait of a man helplessly watching the loss of his own soul . it may be fitting that tom ripley , master chameleon , has taken on yet another new shape for this version of his story . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay/director : jane campion . a couple of months ago , i finally saw jane campion's 1991 film an angel at my table . i mention this only because i experienced a very similar reaction to the piano as i did to that film . while i was not instantly caught up in the story , its impact grew slowly , and in fact it was not until a couple of days later that i realized what a powerful work i had experienced . the piano is a bit less consistent than an angel at my table , but it is nevertheless an astonishingly literate work , and a further step in the development of a major filmmaker . the piano is so rich and multi-layered that it virtually defies immediate reaction . at its heart is a story of socially repressed desires which calls to mind the age of innocence and the remains of the day , but this film strengthens that theme by thrusting its characters into an untamed setting . this conflict lends added texture to stewart's attempt to lock ada into their house , and the perplexed reaction of his housemaids . as intricate as the script is , it is the intensity of the lead performances which gives the piano most of its power . holly hunter has been trumpeted since cannes as an oscar front-runner , and it's easy to see why . it's impossible to describe how expressive she manages to be , in her face and with her body . the literally breath-taking effect of the piano's climactic scene is exponentially multiplied by hunter's slow , lingering reaction . baines' role is less fully explained , a bit too typological , but keitel shows a surprising gentleness . i may have been most impressed by sam neill , freed from the straitjacket of jurassic park to do some splendid acting . hunter's attempt at a scotch accent is shaky , and it detracts somehow from the experience to be allowed inside ada's head . otherwise , campion crafts a stunning film . stuart dryburgh's dynamic cinematography helps capture the power of coastline and forest , and campion's voyeuristic camera placement is thrilling . it's no longer sufficient or appropriate to refer to jane campion as one of the best woman director's working ; she is simply one of the best directors , and the piano is one of the most haunting films of the year . 
screenplay : william nicholson . director : richard attenborough . if anthony hopkins and debra winger aren't careful , they're likely to knock themselves out of contention for academy award nominations by doing too much excellent work in one year . now the two talented actors are paired in richard attenborough's shadowlands , and the result is stunning . this moving , intelligent love story provides winger with her best role in a decade , and hopkins with a chance to add the second best male performance of 1993 to a resume which already includes the best . nicholson's play is a winner , and he has written a sparkling adaptation . the verbal sparring between lewis and joy is wonderful , the best this year not written by william shakespeare . it's the kind of love story hollywood just doesn't turn out all that often , a simple but affecting examination of the ability of love to transform , and to make life's pain bearable . lewis himself wrote about the experience in the philosophical work a grief observed , and that is the tone shadowlands adopts : introspective and restrained , yet still deeply felt . the score by john fenton is non-intrusive , and some of the film's most potent emotional moments are almost completely silent . it's an extremely deft piece of filmmaking by attenborough , a director best known for epics like gandhi but equally skilled at personal moments . and it doesn't hurt that his two leads give oscar-worthy performances . once again hopkins demonstrates the rare ability to act with his entire body , turning an aborted wave to a departing cab into a rich visual text . however , shadowlands would have come up short if joy had not been equally well-handled , and debra winger proves well up to the challenge . there is strength , intelligence , savage wit and deep emotion in her performance , and she somehow manages to steal scenes from one of the finest screen actors in the world . winger has been seen far too infrequently in recent years , but it would appear shadowlands is likely to correct that oversight . shadowlands was well on its way to being a " 10 " before it lost steam in the last half hour . still , shadowlands ranks among the best films of 1993 , artistic and profoundly emotional . 
screenplay : david h . franzoni & john logan and william nicholson . producers : david h . franzoni , branko lustig and douglas wick . director : ridley scott . mpaa rating : r ( violence , gore , adult themes ) running time : 154 minutes . " i am just an entertainer , " sniffs one character to another late in ridley scott's gladiator . the comment is intended as counterpoint to the hero's moral courage and desire to right wrongs , but it also rings an all-too-familiar chord as the movie season heads into its " summer event " phase . how often have brain-dead films been defended with a sniff that it's " just meant to be entertaining ? " how often has " entertainment " in the blockbuster era been defined as " tens of millions of dollars thrown at a production that began without a completed script ? " critics cringe as the first of may draws near , knowing that a cadre of hollywood film-makers who consider themselves " just entertainers " will be spewing forth grotesquely inept stories peppered with explosions and digital effects . with such images in mind , i shouldn't diminish gladiator by tossing out so banal a word as " entertaining " -- but it is . i shouldn't succumb to the temptation to describe it with ad-copy buzzwords like " spectacular ! " or " dazzling ! " or " epic ! " -- but it is . movies just don't get much more fundamentally satisfying on so many levels -- simple without being simplistic , grand in scope without losing track of its basic appeal . the story is , to put it bluntly , older than the roman empire : reluctant-but-impossibly-noble hero fights against great odds to bring low a regal-but-impossibly-dastardly villain . it has been done and done and done again , because when it's done well , few stories are as viscerally effective . and gladiator does it remarkably well . crowe plays maximus as straight as he can possibly be played , giving him an iconic grandeur ; it's the kind of role that makes actors into movie stars . the late oliver reed also scores in his final role as the casually cynical proximo . every one of them is playing a standard film type ; every one of them refuses to submit to the notion that a type can't be played with energy and commitment . as a basic film story , gladiator is lean and effective . and it's not too bad as a visual treat , either . copious use of digital effects is de rigeur for epic genre films circa 2000 , yet there is nothing remotely obligatory or pointlessly showy about gladiator's re-creation of ancient rome . it's stunning work that raises the ruins of the colosseum and captures both the magnificence and the casual brutality of the culture . it is becoming a hollywood clich to claim that " every dollar is up there on the screen , " but that's the way gladiator feels . the execution of its technical detail is so precise that it never feels like more or less than exactly what is necessary to complement the story . if there's a weak link to gladiator , it's the amount of time devoted to roman political intrigue . the imperial/republican squabbling and back-stabbing certainly recall classic sword-n-sandal films like spartacus , but gladiator starts to drag a bit whenever derek jacobi's plotting senator is on screen . perhaps it's just that gladiator is so invigorating as a stripped-down , nuts-and-bolts dramatic adventure that anything remotely resembling subtext just gets in the way . it's even more silly than amusing to contemplate parallels between gladiator's crowd-pleasing bloodsports and professional wrestling ( complete with maximus's combat moniker " the spaniard " ) . the usual caveat for summer event films has been something akin to " leave your brain at the door , " but that's not entirely appropriate or fair to apply to gladiator ; it's too smartly scripted in its old-fashioned way . the better suggestion is to leave your expectations of hipness , reflexivity and big-budget bombast at the door . gladiator is just entertaining . . . in all the wonderful ways that word can be a good thing . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : peter hedges . director : lasse hallstrom . tone alone cannot sustain a film , but it can go a long way . if i can find myself lost in the time and place of a story , it scores immediate style points . when that tone is backed up by an outstanding story and great acting , the effect can be described best by an adjective i do not use lightly : " literary . " what's eating gilbert grape ? is such a film . it's a rich , memorable and stunningly acted story of desire colliding with responsibility , staged in a manner which many viewers might find too prosaic , but which insinuated itself into my imagination with its confidence . the midwestern sunsets and sprawling fields are beautifully photographed , and the atmosphere of the town is intensely real . minor characters , like crispin glover as the town's mortician , are vividly realized , and there are echoes of the last picture show in mary steenburgen's desperately unhappy housewife . not a single note in the depiction of endora rang false . the same can be said of the character of gilbert . it's testimony to the precision involved in his creation that he came together completely with one perfectly placed line , when becky responds to gilbert's description of his father with , " i knew someone like that once . " johnny depp expertly demonstrates the tension central to gilbert by playing everything below the surface , but he never gives in to one-dimensional blankness or simply regurgitates his naif roles in benny & joon and edward scissorhands . depp's performance is overshadowed , however , by leonardo dicaprio's astonishing oscar-nominated supporting work as arnie . he puts to shame such big name actors as john malkovich and dustin hoffman , whose mentally challenged characters never seemed completely real . only juliette lewis doesn't quite click , playing a critical role with her now familiar dopey drone and too little genuine spark . gilbert grape does seem to drift into its conclusion , but it never lost me . thanks to a lovingly created setting and a marvelous cast , this 1993 release proves well worth the wait . 
what i know about classical music , i could explain to you in ten minutes . i had never heard of glenn gould before i heard of this film . it is possible that with greater background knowledge , i might have appreciated thirty-two films about glenn gould more . . . although i can't imagine how . glenn gould is a thoroughly remarkable film experience , as confident as it is ambitious , as masterfully realized as it is skillfully constructed . it is difficult for me to conceive of a biography which more vividly conveys its subject , in all his complexity , and it is easy for me to state that it is the best film i have seen in 1994 . thirty-two short films about glenn gould is exactly what its title would suggest : a series of vignettes examining in various ways the life and music of glenn gould , the acclaimed and enigmatic canadian classical pianist who died in 1982 at the age of 50 . there are also abstract interpretations of gould's work as a performer and as a composer . while each of the thirty-two individually titled segments in glenn gould is self-contained , it is the manner in which they are connected which makes the film so compelling . despite the changes in perspective and varying film techniques , glenn gould never seems fragmented ; it maintains an unmistakable flow which is rarely anything but gripping . it helps that francois girard has chosen such a fascinating subject , but it is girard's brilliant direction which makes gould , the movie and the man , come alive . and while the dramatized sequences tend to present a man of almost other-worldly talent and insight , the inclusion of the interviews with real acquaintances of gould's gives him a fundamental humanity . there is the occasional misstep . a few of the sequences seem repetitive , particularly " practice " and " passion according to gould , " both of which show gould's rapture in response to his own music ; and " the tip , " while amusing , seems somewhat out of place . i was also less than enthralled by the lengthy animated segment " gould meets mclaren , " and " variation in c minor , " another fantasia-like visual representation of music . thirty-two short films about glenn gould introduced me to a fragile , uniquely humanistic genius i wanted to know more about , and in a way i doubt i'll ever forget . 
screenplay : cameron crowe . director : cameron crowe . cameron crowe's almost famous -- the writer/director's first film since 1996's jerry maguire -- tallies up its first simple yet thoroughly inspired moment just seconds into the film , during the opening credits . in a cute conceit connected to the story's protagonist , a 15-year-old aspiring music journalist , we see a hand scrawling out the cast on a yellow pad with a pencil . not a line of dialogue had been spoken , and already i was hooked . to crib a line from crowe's last film , almost famous had me at hello . crowe has helmed only four films in his career -- say anything , singles , jerry maguire and now almost famous -- but i'm tempted to call him america's most effortlessly gifted film-maker . there's nothing particularly profound about a coming-of-age story with a rock 'n' roll backdrop , nor does there need to be . crowe isn't a " statement " kind of guy , and it doesn't seem to hurt his films in the least . almost famous simply drops us into the world of rock in the early '70s , and lets us observe through william's wide eyes . like crowe's other films , this one seems to amble along in no particular hurry to get anywhere , giving the characters lots of room to maneuver , yet never feels unfocused or uninvolving . occasionally the loose structure gets in the way , as it does when crowe fails to provide enough foundation for stillwater's burgeoning popularity either through their music or through their performances . far more often , the moment-to-moment experience is too enjoyable for anyone to notice . in large part , that moment-to-moment pleasure comes from crowe's uncanny ability to direct actors . as he has in his previous films , he puts together a solid cast and makes magic . mcdormand , though she remains a too-mannered performer at times , is still entertaining as william's intense mother ; fugit is likeable and innocent in a way that's never bland ; hoffman is yet again is so good you just want to throttle hollywood for not allowing him to be a star . like william , penny only fools herself into thinking it's ever about the music ; though she creates herself as a sort of muse , she's just looking to fill an empty space with rock 'n' roll's mythology of freedom . penny is the story's anchor , and hudson's facial expressions are so perfect they're heartbreaking . as deftly as crowe handles his story , there are still occasional missteps . those tics and a few others like it might have been more damaging in another film , made by another film-maker , but almost famous just seems to absorb its flaws and roll on . there's something almost hypnotic about the grace with which cameron crowe puts a film together , something that produces winner after winner . it's not a life-changing experience , not a clockwork plot or a joke-a-minute script . it's just the pleasure of watching a director who can suck you in with the brush of an eraser . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
all right , that might be a slight exaggeration ; i have some ideas about that life after death thing . reeves remains a mystery , a physically striking but mush-mouthed thespian who has been cast by coppola , bertolucci and branagh . arriving with more buzz than a swarm of killer bees is speed , and you can believe the hype . thrilling and relentless to a fault , speed seems destined to score big box office and make reeves a very hot property . as high concepts go , speed would have been difficult to screw up completely . where i had my doubts was regarding the ability to keep things varied and interesting ; there are only so many ways a bus can crash through guardrails and other cars . but astonishingly , speed continues to come up with new and interesting predicaments just when you think there can't be anywhere else for it to go . screenwriter graham yost and director jan debont almost give themselves too tough an act to follow by opening with the elevator rescue , a stunningly staged sequence that will leave you breathless before you're even out of popcorn . once the action hits the road , the set pieces come fast , furious and rarely derivative . there is even that rarity of rarities , a moment that inspires a collective audible gasp , followed closely by relieved laughter . the term " edge of your seat " is thrown around a lot , but that is exactly where i spent the majority of speed's two hour running time . he is asked to do little more than set his jaw and look good in a tight t-shirt , and he's good at both . the taciturn traven is a switch from the willis/ schwarzenegger school of one-liner heroism , and something of a welcome one at that . with reeves maintaining a poker face , the required tension release falls to the supporting cast . sandra bullock , so annoying as stallone's partner in demolition man , is extremely appealing as driver/passenger annie , managing to combine strength and emotion in a surprisingly seamless performance . the performances are better than one might expect from a film like speed , and from keanu reeves in particular . if there is a fault to be found with speed , it's that it really doesn't know when enough is enough . the bus's physics defying leap over a stretch of incomplete freeway is more comically absurd than exciting , and almost lost me . once the bus-based plot is over , there's still another fifteen minutes to go , and perhaps out of some sense of houw an action film has to end there is a mano-a-mano between reeves and hopper aboard a commuter train . at that point , yet another set of improbable crises becomes overkill . and ironically , it may have eliminated one possible plot for the sequel . don't be surprised if there is one ; speed is 1994's the fugitive , and then some . summer's first thrill ride is here .

screenplay : david gordon green . director : david gordon green . mpaa rating : unrated ( could be pg-13 for violence , adult themes ) running time : 89 minutes . in david gordon green's haunting feature debut george washington , there is no real story to speak of . actually , it's not accurate to say there's no story in george washington . it's more accurate to say there's no plot , because its story is one of the year's most compelling , even when it occasionally lapses into heavy-handedness . it has become something of a national pastime trying to figure out what's wrong with american teens in the era of columbine , and plenty of films from river's edge to kids and onward have tried to capture the aimlessness , amorality and anarchy of contemporary adolescence . i don't think any one of them has captured the soul of america's confused youth as effectively -- or with as much compassion -- as george washington . if such subject matter sounds like it could turn into pretentious filmmaking , fear not . though green's early slow-motion shots may raise fears that he's trying to make a big statement , he ultimately depends on small statements . his cast of young non-professional actors , often improvising around general story points , finds the truth of these characters in dialogue so casual that its profundity comes as an aftershock . even nasia's occasionally florid voice-over narration feels just right , the attempts of a little girl to convey her worldliness . in its rambling , no-particular-place-to-go rhythm , it's hypnotic viewing . it's also the most beautifully photographed film you're likely to see this year . virtually every scene seems to have been shot in some otherworldly twilight , so golden that they almost hurt the eyes . the rare scenes shot indoors capture the grimness of the characters' domestic lives , and one dark public restroom becomes the film's unique vision of hell . when you're not busy wondering at the naturalistic splendor of the performances , you'll be busy wondering at the carefully constructed splendor of the visuals . george washington's final half hour takes a turn toward other thematic elements , as george attempts to re-define himself after a tragic development . the transition isn't particularly smooth , but green doesn't appear particularly concerned with making his film a smooth experience . indeed , some of his editing and dialogue choices are so off-beat ( like the complete absence of profanity from its teenage characters ) you can't help but just let him carry you wherever he leads . where he's leading is a place hinted at in the film's title , a place where children are forced to look backward for their heroes because there aren't any in their own lives . yes , indeed , george washington does tell a story . if only more films with plots could tell stories like this . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
producers : edward zwick , marshall herskovitz and laura bickford . director : steven soderbergh . in most films about drugs or drug addicts , drugs themselves are an almost supernatural presence . even the very good ones tend to turn addiction into a monster , something that stalks and consumes the people in the film -- a thc-laced blob , or a needle from the black lagoon . they may play with moral ambiguity , but ultimately they come down to a horror film mano a mano : either the monkey kills the hero , or the hero kills the monkey . in steven soderbergh's elusively gripping traffic , drugs are not a monster ; they're not even the villain . drugs become a character , crafted with more complexity and nuance than the human characters in most films . based on a bbc mini-series , traffic sets up an ambitious scope that proves absolutely critical to its effectiveness . every character in the film is in some way complicit in making the drug trade the violent beast it is , from the blatantly unconcerned mexican officials , to the wealthy white teenagers whose pretentious expressions of existential despair ignore the real-world implications of their drug use . steven gaghan's script never once offers either a pat condemnation of anti-drug efforts or a simplistic demonization of the substances themselves . it's a rich , deeply thought-provoking piece of work . it's not half-bad as pure film-making either . soderbergh has become a master of incorporating stylistic innovation into relatively mainstream fare , and he scores again here . the scenes set in mexico are given a grainy , saturated look that make the whole country look like it's suffering from a case of heat-stroke ; there's a sharp , sudden contrast with an early courtroom scene shot in an icy blue . traffic often has an almost improvisational edge to it , and virtually every scene and performance feels kinetic and urgent . this is a film full of scenes that grab you without a hint of melodrama , full of background characters ( peter riegert as ayala's smug attorney , " that '70s show's " topher grace as caroline's cocky boyfriend ) that burst to vibrant life . and that's saying nothing of at least one foreground character ( benicio del toro's conflicted cop ) so splendidly performed that his scenes seem like part of a documentary . traffic only hits speed bumps when the sheer density of the narrative becomes a hindrance . the script occasionally resorts to making speeches to make its points -- with ferrer's mid-level dealer in particular uttering " you can't stop us " taunts to law enforcement -- as though afraid the points already made by the arc of the story would be lost in the shuffle . some of the key characters feel vaguely under-developed , and there are a couple of late scenes and plot developments that feel forced into an already dense tale , giving traffic the sense of being over-loaded during its third act . it's still an awfully good third act , one that wraps up an even better movie with the perfect combination of harsh reality and genuinely satisfying optimism . i'm not sure you could say traffic ever takes a side on its difficult subject , unless it's the side that small , personal victories can still make a losing battle worth fighting . that's a refreshingly mature take on a subject that usually comes down to killing monsters . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay/director : david o . russell . spanking the monkey is as difficult to watch as any film this year . let me clarify that--that is not because it is terrible . on the contrary , spanking the monkey is one of the best films of 1994 to date . but it is not a pleasant experience . it's a blacker- than-pitch comedy about a particularly dysfunctional family , one in which we are witnesses to the implosion of the main character's psyche . what makes it impossible to look away is a pair of stunning lead performances in a story as horifically comic as anything concocted by david lynch . it's not an easy task . mrs . aibelli is demanding and depressive , and takes more than a passing interest in raymond's sex life . it is only because watson allows us to see mrs . aibelli's deep pain that actions which instinctively cause the audience to cringe also seem to make a kind of twisted sense . jeremy davies' performance as raymond is more restrained , but just as poignant . there is a lack of back story written in to russell's script , but davies fills in all the blanks with a reading that tells us that while what we see are extremes , this kind of dysfunction is nothing new to this family . davies carries himself in a state of perpetual tension , a tension which is denied simpler release at every opportunity , and finally boils over with results that prompt very nervous laughter . davies and watson deliver two of the best performances of the year , and give the unpleasant subject matter a surprising appeal . it does at times seem that russell has expended all his energy on the complexities of raymond and his mother . however there are so many piercingly insightful moments that these sketchy characters are easier to tolerate . one extremely effective scene shows raymond hanging out with some old high school acquaintances , guys he clearly didn't like then and likes even less now . it's a scene comic in its painful familiarity , and one more of the many things russell does right to highlight how trapped raymond feels . spanking the monkey deals with difficult subjects in a brutally honest manner , and will have an inherently limited audience , but it so daring and well-acted that it is worth risking the unpleasant taste it may leave in your mouth . 
screenplay/director : quentin tarantino . according to all evidence , pulp fiction is going to be one of those movies that turns people into incarnations of beavis and butthead ; either it " sucks " or it " kicks ass , " apparently with no tenable middle ground . this of course is the natural course of things for films as unique as pulp fiction . quentin tarantino's stunning sophomore effort deserves better . it is the kind of film , imperfect though it may be , which should inspire discussion about how exciting the medium can be . there are more moments in this one film which awed me to silence than in every other 1994 release combined , and while its faults may not allow it to stand as the year's best film , it's certainly close . pulp fiction is divided into segments telling interlocking tales about a group of shady characters . this is what must be said about pulp fiction : few films in the last fifteen years have left me so charged with the pure gonzo thrill of movie-making . has there been a more erotically charged conversation than that between vincent and mia at a gaudy 50's-style burger joint ? has the flushing of a toilet ever caused such a combination of laughter and suspense . and has any scene caused an entire audience to squirm quite so violently as a spectacular moment involving an overdose victim and a six inch hypodermic needle ? quentin tarantino refuses to let any moment just sit there ; relationships between characters crackle with intensity , and darkly comic punch lines are spit out like bullets . i left pulp fiction feeling as though i had not simply watched a movie , but * experienced * one . i was exhausted . however , it would be a mistake to suggest that there is nothing to pulp fiction but its visceral impact . tarantino does not place his characters in a universe of amoral anarchy ; as reservoir dogs first indicated , he is fascinated with loyalty and moments of improbable selflessness . two such moments provide the moral backbone of pulp fiction . both are showcases for career performances . willis is better than his previous work had ever so much as hinted at , while jackson delivers what is quite simply the best performance in an american film this year . it is at these moments when pulp fiction , for all its frantic energy , reveals its real message : even in a world this violent , salvation is possible . the only real problem with pulp fiction is a significant lag between the marvelous middle segment and jackson's tour-de-force monologue . but tarantino brackets that lull with such sheer cinematic glory , that the sour taste doesn't linger . pulp fiction is violent , profane and filled with addicts , racists and killers . at the same time , it may be one of the most moral stories the big screen has seen in years . that tarantino was able to pull off that little maneuver says as much about his talent as a dozen palmes d'or . 
screenplay : george welsh and peter jackson . director : peter jackson . earlier this year , i commented on thematically similar films where the later release suffered in comparison to the first . wyatt earp languished in the wake of the less reverent but far more entertaining tombstone ; blown away was blown away by the gleefully brainless speed . it was not a great film , but good enough that i wondered if my evaluation of heavenly creatures might be influenced . but where fun was occasionally stagy and ponderous , heavenly creatures is dazzling , a perversely original psychodrama . the strongest elements in fun were the performances of the two young lead actresses , and ironically the same elements provide the only minor weak link in heavenly creatures . melanie lynskey is the better of the two , playing the more complicated character , but it seems she settles into expressing every emotion by glowering beneath her nest of unruly dark curls ; kate winslet is occasionally a bit much , arching her eyebrows and punching her oh-so-proper upper crust diction . however , their scenes together are quite effective , and they show a natural rapport . lynskey in particular comes alive beautifully , and the intensity of their relationship never seems implausible . it is also illustrated with astonishing creativity by peter jackson , best known for the marvelously demented dead alive . from the first frames , jackson slams us into a world of chaos and delusion , and even through light-hearted scenes there is a sense of foreboding as we await the inevitable conclusion . this is the real triumph of heavenly creatures : although it is alternately a drama , a fantasy and a mystery , it is an absolutely coherent whole . because we know where this relationship will lead , there is an undercurrent of menace in dark-humored sequences where pauline visualizes revenge fantasies . it also presents the disturbing premise that given the right ( or wrong ) circumstances , the fantasy world every adolescent creates could explode into the real world . those circumstances involve a delicate issue , one also raised by fun . since there is a sexual element to the relationship between pauline and juliet , it would be possible to misinterpret the film as suggesting that their crime , leopold and loeb-like , was just another manifestation of their " deviance . " but jackson is up to something more subtle than that . through both his audacious direction and an insightful script , peter jackson has crafted a powerful character study that is unlike anything you'll see this year . 
screenplay : robin swicord . director : gillian armstrong . it would be a tremendous disservice to think of little women as a picture post card with a plot . sure , it is lovingly photographed , rich in atmosphere and steeped in period detail . but does louisa may alcott's saga of 19th century adolescence have anything to say in 1994 ? is it really * about * anything ? the answer is a resounding yes . as brought to life by a magnificent cast and directed with restraint by gillian armstrong , little women is sweet , glorious and relevant . director armstrong , who addressed the subject of women struggling in a man's world in my brilliant career , has done a splendid job with this latest version of the oft-filmed story . she never attempts to inject inappropriate action into the narrative , and keeps her actors quiet and naturalistic . she is also assisted by a wonderful technical crew . cinematographer geoffrey simpson captures snow-covered landscapes and glowing fall colors with grace , and production designer jan roelfs fills the screen with lovely interiors . the crowning touch is thomas newman's beautiful score , which perfectly complements the beautiful images armstrong provides . the primary reason the screen glows , however , is a remarkable cast which features the most talented young actresses in the business . jo is the showcase role , and winona ryder gives her most complete performance yet in taking it on ; she is full of ambition , joy , and self-doubt . physically , she's quite wrong for the part ( it's hard to believe anyone would consider ryder's hair her " one beauty , " even without makeup ) , but she's so impressive emotionally that her looks can be forgiven . claire danes , from tv's critically-praised by largely unwatched " my so-called life , " may be the best of the bunch . beth's role is small , but danes injects phenomenal emotion into every one of her scenes , and her large , sad eyes guarantee that many eyes in the audience will be damp at certain moments . what may be most impressive about this little women , adapted by robin swicord , is how it seems as though it might have been written yesterday . there is no anachronism in alcott's transcendentalist proto-feminism , though upon first glance it might appear so . i saw little women in a theater where perhaps one third of the audience consisted of girls under sixteen . little women may be a story to which they are most attuned , but it is a delight for anyone who appreciates genuine emotion , insight , and beautiful filmmaking . 
screenplay : alan bennett . director : nicholas hytner . how do you market a stage-originated historical drama to an american viewing public which forced a change in the film's title when they struggled with the concept that the madness of king george iii was not a sequel ? you could tell them that , like medicine or " masterpiece theater , " it was good for them , an approach which rarely works . or you could try this truth : the madness of king george is thoughtful , funny , spectacularly staged and richly performed . nigel hawthorne's complex performance as george iii brings the humanity to the role necessary to raise alan bennett's story of monarchy in decline to a work of rare insight . perhaps more than anything else , the madness of king george is about the dissolution of monarchy . finally , as willis straps him to a chair , his statement that " i am the king " is greeted by a simple " no . . . you are the patient . " if it appears from this description that alan bennett , who adapted his own stage play for the screen , is baldly anti-royalty , that isn't entirely the case . he makes george a remarkably sympathetic character , and casts an even darker eye on the machinations of those whose only concerns about his well-being are political . he is by turns comic , petulant , tender and infuriating , crafting a performance so vivid that it is easy to forget that he is playing a king . the most pleasant surprise in the madness of king george may be that stage director nicholas hytner , in his first screen directing effort , demonstrates such an instinctive understanding of what makes the two media different . he opens up the play , taking advantage of ken adam's superb production design , and he uses close-ups to marvelous effect . in fact , the only things wrong with the film might be a few lackluster supporting performances and references which require a bit too much knowledge of british political history ( notably a pun on " pitt the elder and pitt the younger " ) . 
starring : mick lally , eileen colgan , jeni courtney , richard sheridan , john lynch . screenplay/director : john sayles . that john sayles continues to make films is something of a testimony to his dedication , and that his films continue to be released is a testimony to an audience somewhere out there with taste and intelligence . sayles has been relentlessly his own animal as a writer-director , making movies like the brother from another planet , matewan and passion fish which have been marketing nightmares because they were unique tales that a single tag line couldn't capture . as those examples also show , sayles doesn't help his cause any with catchy titles . the secret of roan inish is another of sayles' unconventional efforts , and yet another work of art , a beautifully filmed tale of myth , magic and the power of oral history . gifted cinematographer haskell wexler captures stunning land- and seascapes with clarity even through layers of mist , and his interiors are close but inviting . mason daring's arrangements of traditional folk melodies provide the perfect complement to wexler's images , full of soaring tin whistle and plaintive violin . most effective is sayles' unsentimental directing style , which presents roan inish's more mythical elements so matter-of-factly that they take on even more of an aura of wonder . the ireland of the secret of roan inish is full of magic , and sayles presents magic as an understood part of the tapestry of irish life . what keeps the magic alive , however , is the oral tradition , and this is what sayles is truly celebrating in the secret of roan inish . even though we are also seeing the events described , it is the words which are truly memorable , spoken with passion and conviction , a direct link through time between individuals and their history . at a time when tradition is a somewhat unfashionable concept , sayles has crafted a love poem to tradition . there is probably not a single name or face in the cast of roan inish which is familiar to american audiences , but the performances are mostly charming and understated . newcomers jeni courtney ( fiona ) and richard sheridan ( fiona's cousin and co-conspirator eamon ) have their weak moments , but are basically solid . the secret of roan inish is lyrical , low-key and evocative , which could translate to " slow and boring " for some audiences . those with a taste for something crafted with grace , confidence and a feel for the power of a well-told tale will find this one secret worth sharing . 
screenplay : malcolm bradbury . director : john schlesinger . cold comfort farm is directed with such sparkle and confidence that i almost couldn't believe john schlesinger was behind the camera . . . at least not the john schlesinger whose recent contributions to the cinematic canon were suspense misfires like pacific heights , the innocent and eye for an eye . even in his glory days of midnight cowboy , the day of the locust and marathon man , one would hardly say that " light-hearted " was an adjective applicable to his work . yet here we find schlesinger tackling the much-beloved stella gibbons novel , a parody with a giddy and irreverent tone , and nailing it . cold comfort farm is thoroughly entertaining and consistently surprising . a literary satire is a real challenge to film -- it's like trying to pull the humor out of that annual contest to duplicate hemingway's prose style and put it on screen -- but screenwriter malcolm bradbury has come up with the clever premise of following flora's budding writing career . grasping at the perfect metaphor for a sunset ( she can never quite figure out what " the golden orb " is supposed to do ) over her open d . h . lawrence novels , flora allows us a bit of insight into the florid writing gibbons was winking at . but cold comfort farm is even more successful at turning the conventions of those genres' plots upside down . those secrets turn out to be red herrings ; it doesn't matter _what_ they are , only that everyone at cold comfort farm is living under the weight of those long-past events , waiting for someone like flora to come along and push each of them in the direction of the one thing that will make them genuinely excited . the result is some hilarious moments and sharp performances , as we watch amos improvising a sermon before his church of ( literally ) quivering brethren , and seth grabbing his chance at big-screen stardom , and the characters are rendered with a refreshing lack of concern over whether they are being condescended to . that is a criticism some detractors have leveled against cold comfort farm , and i think they are missing the point . but schlesinger and bradbury show gibbons' characters with an eye to the basic desire for happiness which flora is trying to uncover . flora brings a breath of life to cold comfort farm , and schlesinger's cold comfort farm brings a breath of life to a decidedly musty film season . 
screenplay : todd solondz . director : todd solondz . actually , she may be more typical , which is to say more miserable . well , welcome to the dollhouse , todd solondz's brutally funny portrait of the nightmare that is adolescence . it should be made perfectly clear that welcome to the dollhouse is not , in that favored film terminology , a " coming-of-age " story . no one becomes an adult at 11 , and while solondz features such rites of passage as dawn's first big crush and first kiss , she learns no great truths about life . no , welcome to the dollhouse is about a much more basic truth -- that there is no more unpleasant time in a human life than the middle school years . welcome to the dollhouse is an episodic story which follows dawn through several weeks of her seventh-grade year , and some of those episodes are so perfectly handled that they are painful to watch . it is surprising that solondz has captured the world of a young girl with such detail , but he is dealing with a time where the horrors of unpopularity are very similar between the genders , and where knowledge about sex is still too abstract to make the psychology of adolescence completely different . the fact that she _is_ a girl simply allowed heather matarazzo to nail the part with a startling willingness to look completely homely , and to be less than heroic . the magic of matarazzo's performance is that we feel for her not because she is better than those who torment her , but because her fate is so familiar . when solondz does stumble , it is because he tries to move beyond the simple truths of dawn's life to big-picture issues , or to give his story an artificial sense of resolution . the old saying that comedy is simply tragedy plus time is most certainly true when it comes to adolescence , and welcome to the dollhouse is a winning portrait of the only story that matters when you are eleven years old and different : getting out alive . 
directors : kirk wise and gary trousdale . as i sat in my car twenty minutes after the conclusion of the hunchback of notre dame , tears still welling up in my eyes , i though about what made me respond to disney's recent animated hits , even flawed efforts like pocahontas . it was not simply animation to which i was responding , since animated films like balto had left me unmoved , and i like to believe that disney's ubiquitous marketing had no influence . i thought about the moments in films like beauty and the beast and the little mermaid which had filled me with the pure joy of film artistry , and i realized the connection : music . the hunchback of notre dame is dark , enchanting , visually spectacular and richer in thematic depth than 99% of the live action films i see , but i know that it was the power of grand opera which pushed me over the edge . there is no question that computer technology is allowing disney animators an ever-increasing freedom , and the opportunity to create some astonishing images . there are scenes involving thousands of " extras " which are simply extraordinary , and a swooping shot as quasimodo comes to esmeralda's rescue which is breath-taking . still , the conventional character animation might be even better . it seems almost unfair to single out one star , but i will : kathy zielinski , the character supervisor for frollo . she has designed one of disney's most complicated villains ever , a tormented and hateful zealot with a mouth so cruel and subtly expressive that he makes you want to shudder every time he smiles . with superb voice work by tony jay , frollo becomes a brilliant characterization . if an animator ever deserved credit for a best supporting actor performance , this might be the case . frollo's tortured soul ( revealed in a creepy and very un-disney-like song called " hellfire " ) is just one of many rather adult subjects which gives hunchback a surprising resonance . quasimodo's cowering respect for frollo is heart-breaking , rendered poignantly by tom hulce . there is certainly a fair amount of comic relief , mostly provided by the gargoyles and the lively number " a guy like you , " but if hunchback is at all a film for children , it is one which exposes them to issues their parents should be prepared to discuss . the messages in hunchback are powerful , and they are skillfully handled , but there is something that happens when they are set to music . the songs by alan menken and steven schwartz are not particularly memorable by disney standards , nothing you will be humming for days afterwards like " be our guest " or " under the sea , " but they are evocative . a heartfelt sentiment which is sung rather than spoken draws its emotion from a different place . hollywood seems to believe that no one wants to see a musical in 1996 , and that disney's films are aberrations because they are animated . i'm not convinced that the real issue isn't choice of material . disney selects timeless tales , and a timeless tale in song is a powerful thing . there are certainly more than a few similarities between the hunchback of notre dame and beauty and the beast ( also directed by kirk wise and gary trousdale ) ; if it had been live action , i'd have sworn that they re-used some of the same sets in the opening number . beauty and the beast is a better film , a classic , and yet there i was , twenty minutes after the conclusion of hunchback , tears still welling up in my eyes , emotionally invested in the life of an animated character . and though the songs may not have been on my lips , i know they were in my heart . 
nihilism does not equal art . i want to get that point out of the way , because it appears to be a widely-held belief that critics feel exactly the opposite . people note the praise lavished upon films like natural born killers , kids and seven and conclude that there is some conspiracy among the film cognoscenti to force bleakness down the collective throat of the viewing public . while i can speak for no critic but myself ( i admired seven , but not nbk or kids ) , i believe that the common thread is actually daring . film-makers dealing with unpleasant subject matter are almost forced to be inventive to keep the audience watching . others , if they choose , may praise trainspotting for its squalor ; i prefer to praise it for the invigorating perspectives of a writer and a director with ideas and the ability to convey them . no one is clean ; it's all a question of degree . but if there is one thing boyle does masterfully , it is showing exactly how brutal this particular degree can be . the users' relationship with the drug might be romanticized -- including a scene in which renton feels himself sinking into the floor -- there is nothing romanticized about the effects of heroin addiction . in some of these scenes there is a comic edge , but boyle counters them with some absolutely chilling moments , including a tragedy for which the only response anyone can think of is to get high again , and a nightmarish detox hallucination by renton which is guaranteed to have you squirming . with a virtuoso's skill , boyle is able to take viewers deeply enough into the experience of heroin users that they can see both the horrible toll the drug takes and the sensation which makes it all worthwhile to them . trainspotting's third act , focusing on a heroin deal which interferes in renton's attempt to live a straight life , is something of an unfortunate side trip , as the film loses much of the urgency it had done such an exceptional job of building . it does give robert carlyle's hair-trigger psychotic begbie a showcase , but the whole episode feels like padding in a much edgier film . it also provides a perfect comic coda for renton's stab at respectability , because it's clear he doesn't have the moral fiber for it . that actually shows what a neat trick boyle has pulled off : he has made a moral film without moralizing , even though it might not look like one on the surface . bleak may not always be beautiful , but in trainspotting it is necessary to make the point , a point as sharp as a needle in the arm . 
ron shelton appears to understand two things better than any other contemporary film-maker : sports , and kevin costner . put a sports movie in the hands of almost any other director , and you get the feeling that they're just biding their time until the big climactic game/fight/match ; put kevin costner in the hands of almost any other director , and you find the thin-voiced actor placed in the uncomfortable position of playing commanding and heroic . when the two men joined forced previously , for 1988's bull durham , the result was one of the best and funniest sports films ever , and probably costner's best performance ever . that casually charming costner is re-born in tin cup , yet another superior shelton sports film overflowing with pleasures . there are a lot of kevin costner bashers out there -- i have been known to be one of them -- who have forgotten that he became a star in films like bull durham and field of dreams which allowed him to be warm , funny and approachable . that is too bad , but it happened because costner himself and plenty of other directors forgot , too . tin cup is a reminder of costner at his best , boyishly handsome and with an equally boyish temperament , and he has so much effortless fun playing roy that it is nearly impossible not to have fun with him . he is like a little league player who never out-grew little league , always swinging for the fences and always eager to please . costner manages to make immaturity incredibly endearing . shelton has given costner a great character to work with , and has fashioned a great story around that character . bull durham was so authentic in its detail about minor league baseball that it was easy to overlook the fact that shelton made a film that wasn't just about baseball . it was about playing a game because you loved it so much you couldn't imagine doing anything else , and the frustration of seeing a player with less love ( tim robbins' nuke laloosh ) have so much more talent . roy's problem is that he understands all too well that fans don't watch professional sports to see the steady hitter , the guy who runs the precise receiving route , or the guy who can make all his free throws ; they watch to see the home run hitter , the flashy runner , or the 360 degree dunk . that is what makes a ron shelton sports movie better than anyone else's sports movies : he has a better understanding of the way fans and players think . he also knows how to create scenes which sing with unexpected wit . shelton also gives his actors subtly eccentric characters to play , with tremendous results . only the leisurely , golf-like pace of tin cup proves troubling -- at 135 minutes , it has a few too many dead spots , and a rather unnecessary tangent involving roy's stripper ex-girlfriend . but by the time tin cup ends , those moments will have been forgotten . you'll be thinking about how smartly and cleverly ron shelton can write a sports film , how good kevin costner can be in them , and how many sports might be left on which they can collaborate . 
if the ancient greeks hadn't already defined drama as character in action , mike leigh would have had to do it . leigh , along with ken loach , eric rohmer and john sayles , is in that exclusive company of film-makers who understand that an effective story is not simply what happens to the people on the screen -- it _is_ the people on the screen . a mike leigh film is the ultimate in low concept , the actors burying themselves so deeply in their characters that they are able to tear out their hearts and lay them bare . secrets & lies is about human beings , and that is what makes it a rarity ; what makes it great is how compelling the interaction between those human beings turns out to be . there are so many brilliantly shaded characterizations in secrets & lies that the oscars could find contenders in every major category if the voters were inclined to notice . with so many superb characterizations in secrets & lies , it is all the more extraordinary that brenda blethyn's work leaps out at you . cynthia purley is a woman whose entire life has been a desperate search for someone to show her affection , a search which has resulted mostly in pain , and blethyn makes her one of the most heartbreaking characters i have ever seen committed to film . the scene in which cynthia and hortense meet for the first time is staged by leigh in one mesmerizing seven minute take , with blethyn taking us through a dizzying array of emotions : regret , fear , anxiety , embarrassment , pride , relief . it is an utterly remarkable piece of acting . as fascinating as all these individuals are , however , it is the way in which they are joined to tell a story of a family in crisis which elevates secrets & lies . leigh is so skillful for so long that it is a genuine shame that the final fifteen minutes are devoted largely to an over-wrought airing of emotional dirty laundry , with tears , speeches and accusations flying across the living room . he didn't need manufactured drama of that sort , because the characters in secrets & lies live lives of everyday drama . they , and mike leigh's film , are beautiful simply because they are human . 
screenplay : anthony minghella . director : anthony minghella . mpaa rating : r ( nudity , sexual situations , profanity , violence ) running time : 160 minutes . michael ondaatje's booker prize-winning novel _the english patient_ looked to be a remarkably difficult work to translate to the screen . a tale of intertwined lives which weaves its way through several time periods with a lyrical , dream-like prose style , it is the kind of narrative which could turn into a catastrophic failure as much in the hands of a too-reverential film-maker as a completely oblivious one . though miles removed from ondaatje's psychological drama , minghella's the english patient stands on its own as a powerful sweeping romance . . wonderful ) , but the english patient is a romance with the kind of sweep you associate with films made , and not merely set , in the 1940s . ralph fiennes turns in a wonderfully economical performance as almasy , a reserved man who begins with the minimalist philosophy that " a thing is a thing " but becomes utterly intoxicated by the first real passion in his life . kristin scott thomas matches his work with a radiant sensuality , turning the smart , perceptive katherine a deserving object of any man's fixation . thomas and fiennes share the kind of beautiful but intense chemistry movies seem reluctant to show us in 1996 , perhaps afraid that a cynical modern audience will not be able to take such deeply felt emotions seriously . it is not every writer who would risk dialogue like " every night i cut out my heart , but in the morning it was full again ; " it is not every director who would stage the defining moment in a relationship -- a scene in which almasy and katherine share a dance to , appropriately enough , " where or when " -- with virtually no dialogue , the attraction conveyed through a soul-piercing gaze by fiennes . minghella tries to link the two love stories in his film , but that may be the one place he is less than successful -- he has focused his story so decidedly on almasy and katherine that the peripheral characters are sometimes more distracting than complementary . it is to minghella's credit , however , that he has clarified a number of points in his streamlined narrative , creating a uniquely powerful story , less intricate and internalized than ondaatje's novel but just as involving . the quality which may make the english patient so singularly effective is its refusal to fit into neatly-defined categories of romantic film-making . it is emotional , yet it is suspenseful and full of action ; it is intensely personal , yet played against a historical and geographical backdrop filmed with bronzed grandeur by john seale ; it has moments of utter seriousness , then subverts a tender moment with an throwaway bit of comedy where katherine bangs her head on a girder . as risky as it might be to throw around comparisons with classics , the english patient is the kind of combination of humor , detailed characterization , passion and politics which recalls casablanca . almasy and katherine may share an on-screen consummation which cinema could not attempt 50 years ago , but in most other ways the central love story of the english patient warrants consideration among the great tragic pairings . minghella's risky adaptation has paid off gloriously , proving they _can_ make 'em like they used to . 
kristin scott thomas's narration occupies only about ninety seconds of the dazzling documentary microcosmos , which made it even easier to hear every comment in an audience composed largely of families with young children . ordinarily , the prospect of an afternoon spent with a crowd of garrulous youngsters might send me screaming for an iv drip of valium , but the 75 minutes i spent in microcosmos may have been the most uplifting 75 minutes i've spent in a theater in years . here were 9- and 10-year-olds asking questions about insects , enraptured by the natural world , chattering excitedly in the lobby afterwards about their favorite scenes . it was one of those rare occasions when a film left me a bit more optimistic about our collective future as inquisitive beings . it is a simple enough concept ( though the process was anything but simple ) , but what makes microcosmos so consistently enthralling is the ability of nuridsany and perennou to find stories in their tiny subjects , stories which give them a personality . mating is not shown in clinical detail with a dry narrative description -- instead , two snails meet , caress and embrace in a strangely beautiful moment set to a soaring aria . in perhaps the film's most memorable sequence , a sacred scarab beetle rolls a small ball of dung until he is halted by a briar jutting out of the ground . the ability of that sequence to turn a beetle into a hero demonstrates that nuridsany and perennou have a talent most feature film-makers only dream about . most of us have seen nature footage of birds or amphibians which made the insects the insects upon which they snacked insignificant bit players in the food chain . microcosmos is like a novel based on another novel's supporting characters , turning sub-plots into life stories . one exceptional shot captures the bird's eye through the entrance to the ants' tunnels like an ogre peeping through a keyhole at his prey ; another represents the bird as a monstrous shadow . the film-makers want to show you parts of our world you may have taken for granted , and to show you in a way which grabs you as a narrative as much as an entomology lesson . in fact , the only time microcosmos sags is when it does resemble conventional nature footage . it is interesting watching a spider speed-wrap a grasshopper caught in its web , but it is a purely intellectual interest ; the same is true of a spider which constructs a kind of underwater diving bell for itself . these are moments which might make you go " hmmm , " but they don't fascinate you like a battle between stag beetles which seems to personalize the combatants . yet one of the best moments in the stag beetle sequence is a seemingly throwaway scene of another , smaller insect being tossed to the ground during the titanic struggle like a nameless patron in a western bar room brawl . it seems that even within this world there are supporting characters , and the wonderful thing about microcosmos is that you find yourself waiting for nuridsany and perennou to follow the unfortunate fellow on his own adventure , to the delight of children and adults alike . 
screenplay : cameron crowe . director : cameron crowe . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , brief nudity , sexual situations ) running time : 135 minutes . there is an absolute poetry to the casting of tom cruise as jerry maguire which i do not think could have been matched by the casting of any other actor . then jerry describes his personal dilemma in voice-over , including a simple phrase -- " i was 35 years old " -- which is like a temporal slap in the face to anyone who finds it hard to reconcile cruise's image with the fact that " the kid " isn't a kid any more . what is most impressive about cameron crowe's script is not just that it is so rich and funny , but that it keeps so many balls in the air without once feeling crowded or directionless . every other bit of character interaction soars because the characters are so carefully drawn . they also are acted with uniform excellence , beginning with renee zellweger as the wistful dorothy , who treats jerry like an icon of a better life . the arc of her feelings for him -- from exhilaration to painful realism -- is rendered beautifully by zellweger , and the emotion she can express with her face is sometimes enough to make you want to burst into tears . he has a moment during an end zone dance which by all rights should be ridiculous ; instead , gooding makes it a glorious celebration . there is also the under-stated perfection of bonnie hunt's supporting work , and jay mohr in a marvelously despicable turn has jerry's conscience-impaired protege . however , the most memorable cast member may be young jonathan lipnicki , who virtually re-defines scene-stealing . with his spiky hair , round glasses and a smile which rivals that of his celebrated co-star , lipnicki brings a goofy energy to the screen , yet there is never a moment when he seems aware of his own adorableness . he is simply hilarious , and the affection between him and cruise makes for some priceless moments . jerry maguire is a film which doesn't appear to end far from where it started , because jerry is still a sports agent and still trying to make a good deal . in fact , jerry maguire is not just about one man's journey -- dorothy and rod also make subtle changes in their attitudes which help them discover what is really of value to them . jerry maguire is a simple but thoroughly uplifting story which is as funny as it is touching , and it finds tom cruise no longer cruising on that famous smile . . . although he may have cause to smile at his own efforts to do what he does in life a bit better . 
the release of george lucas' seminal blockbuster 20 years ago was the kind of happening which affected a generation of movie-goers , and i include myself in that generation . i was 10 years old in 1977 , and when you were 10 years old in 1977 you were not judged by whether you had seen star wars ; you were judged by how many _times_ you had seen star wars . it awed us , it delighted us . . . and yes , hyperbolic though it might seem to say so , it changed us . as much as it changed the people who watched movies , however , it changed the people who made movies even more . hollywood heads were sent spinning by the success of star wars , a film with no stars , a simplistic story-line out of old westerns and some nifty special effects . it was not long before studio executives realized that two fundamental lessons of star wars could be translated to other films : 1 ) if you made a special effects-laden adventure with a modicum of skill and dropped it into your summer release schedule , when young potential movie-goers had summer job money burning holes in their pockets , they would come and come again , story be damned ; 2 ) one successful film could turn into one or two more , plus action figures , lunchboxes and t-shirts ( the twin goddesses of franchising and merchandising ) . and they slew the medium-budget film , and there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth . you can't really blame lucas for what has happened to american film-making , though , because there is no way he intended for crass commercial concerns to become so dominant . there is no way star wars could have worked if he _had_ had such an intention . lost in all the ink spilled with references to joseph campbell , back-brain mythopoetics and anti-technological humanism is the fact that star wars was not a great movie . the most surprising thing a viewer might find in the special edition has nothing to do with with the dozens of critters tossed into the backgrounds , but rather how restless he might get waiting through the first half . star wars wasn't a great movie ; it was , however , an extraordinary movie-going experience . you sat in a theater with a few hundred other people and for two hours you were utterly transported , because it was innocent in a way no film can ever be innocent again . you felt as though you were part of something joyous , a celebration of cinema as fantasy and a celebration of good triumphing over evil . in an era when you can see the veins bulging on big-budget action films as they strain to impress you , star wars was effortless in its enchantment . that movie-going experience is what this re-release is all about . the difference between star wars on the big screen and star wars on the small screen is the difference between mount rushmore and a picture of mount rushmore , between wagner on a cassette deck and wagner played by a symphony orchestra . if there is an element of not-inconsequential element of nostalgia in the way crowds will flock to this re-release , that is understandable ; many will be hoping to re-capture a youthful moment when they fell in love with movies for the first time . star wars : special edition may end up disappointing those who come to it as though on a pilgrimage , but the dazzling editing of the climactic trench run will certainly remind anyone who has seen what passes for a " spectacular " in the last few years how exciting a science-fiction adventure film can be . there has been some consternation over the idea of lucas fiddling with such a cherished film , but frankly , i don't understand all the fuss . but if anything lucas has done threatens someone's memories of a first experience of star wars , i can only suggest that the experience couldn't have been terribly profound . in terms of the details , this is a different star wars , but it is the spirit of this story which has moved people for twenty years . 
screenplay : leigh brackett and lawrence kasdan . director : irvin kirshner . mpaa rating : pg ( violence ) running time : 125 minutes . if pressed , i think most aficionados of the star wars trilogy would agree that the empire strikes back is the best of the three -- the best written , the best acted and the most skillfully constructed . however , it is not nearly as beloved as the original star wars , and though the newly released the empire strikes back : special edition is certain to be a success , it is unlikely to come close to inspiring the mania the return of star wars did on january 31st . so why will the same person who tells you to your face that empire is the better film only see it once this time around after seeing star wars two or three times ? the answers to that question -- and there are several -- are in some ways specific to this film . in other ways , they explain a lot about what people go to the movies to see , what they go to see _again_ , and why . what makes empire so extraordinary in retrospect is how many chances george lucas and his new crew -- director irvin kirshner and screenwriters lawrence kasdan and leigh brackett -- took when they had everything to lose by doing so . no image in star wars is as dark and creepy as luke's dream vision of his own face behind vader's mask , and obi-wan's vague homilies about the force in the original become yoda's extended lessons in an almost zen philosophy in empire . following a film which was the very definition of a crowd-pleaser , empire concluded with the good guys in disarray , one of them captured and another one crippled ( emotionally , if not ultimately physically ) . here was a blockbuster which had the audacity to mess with the most successful film formula anyone had yet discovered , a feature film which ended the way feature films just weren't supposed to end : with a cliff-hanger worthy of the old radio serials . those twists made the empire strikes back exciting and challenging in a way star wars wasn't , but they also made it a less satisfying movie-going experience . star wars ended with a victory for the heroes , a fanfare and a rousing ovation , allowing the audience to leave both entertained and with a basic sense of resolution . empire was not so generous . it took the simple good-vs . -evil the audience for a story set in that kind of world is smaller than the audience for a story set in star wars' morally bi-polar universe , and it's hard to imagine the empire strikes back would have been a success if it had been the first film to feature these same characters instead of star wars . the pure throw-back adventure of star wars was undemanding , but you were almost certain to leave the theater smiling , and ready to hop back on the ride again for yet another chance to come out smiling . meanwhile , the very complexity which made the empire strikes back a richer film also made it a film less likely to inspire multiple visits to the theater . after all , how many times did viewers want to be reminded that it was going to be another three years before they found out if darth vader was really . . . you fortunately , the special edition will inspire those who know star wars line for line to take a closer look at the empire strikes back , and it's not just what was there in 1980 which may impress them . there are fewer new touches than there were in the star wars : special edition , and those which are there -- a longer , more tense scene in which luke escapes a wampa on hoth ; enhanced footage of the arrival on cloud city -- are both less obtrusive and more useful . it is the sound , however , which is most spectacular in this new incarnation , an awesome demonstration of the kind of experience even a " home theater " can never possibly duplicate . the empire strikes back deserves its second theatrical life every bit as much as star wars , if not more , yet there were notably fewer people applauding at the end of empire . i'm not convinced that means the audience enjoyed it less ; i do think it means they will see it less . the amazing thing is that , in a cinematic economy where an unhappy ending is the kiss of death , george lucas dared to lure the star wars audience into a darker world at all . 
screenplay : alexander payne and jim taylor . director : alexander payne . if you live in one of the half-dozen or so cities where miramax gave the film a trial run , you missed it months ago ; if you don't live in one of those cities , you never even got the chance to miss it . no one markets unconventional or controversial films better than miramax , but even they couldn't get more than a handful of people into theaters to see citizen ruth . you see , citizen ruth is about abortion . no , wait , it gets worse -- citizen ruth is a _comedy_ about abortion . it sets out to offend nearly everyone , and succeeds . it's got an unrepentant loser as its protagonist , and she's the most likeable character in the film . in short , citizen ruth has absolutely everything working against it except a blisteringly funny script , assured direction and a remarkably brave lead performance by laura dern . of course the other side isn't about to sit still for such tactics , eventually snaring ruth away from the stoneys to make their own political statement . if you were inclined to keep a tally , you'd probably find that alexander payne and co-writer jim taylor don't split their mockery evenly down the middle . that doesn't mean the pro-choice advocates get off easy . it's also hard not to chuckle at the terribly earnest paean one lesbian couple sings to the " moon mother . " there is only one place where the film-makers' sympathies obviously lie , and that is with ruth . you may have a hard time sharing that sympathy , however , because laura dern isn't interested in making you like ruth . it is a gutsy and brilliant performance , one on which the success of citizen ruth as a social satire depends . if ruth stoops is turned into one of the sanctified poor , the film collapses under the weight of its sincerity . she is a walking worst-case scenario , which makes it easy for both sides to use her as an example . it also makes it impossible for either side to control her , making for some of the funniest film moments of the year . payne's most extraordinary accomplishment may be satirizing both sides of a serious issue while never understating the seriousness of the issue itself . in fact , citizen ruth is really about how this particular battle has taken on a life of its own apart from the people affected by it . it is a telling moment . it's a shame that a subversively spectacular film like citizen ruth managed to walk away just as unnoticed . 
screenplay : andrew w . marlowe . director : wolfgang petersen . the phenomenally popular presidency of ronald reagan , if nothing else , gave us a solid sense of what the american people really want in a chief executive . if that phrase doesn't describe harrison ford among all a-list hollywood stars , i don't know whom it does describe . that kind of man isn't just the perfect president -- he's also the perfect action hero . air force one is an extraordinarily effective thriller by any standard , but it's even better with ford on board . wolfgang petersen's direction combines the claustrophobia of das boot with the cat-and-mouse dynamic of in the line of fire , then throws in a few stomach-churning dogfights and mid-air escape attempts just for seasoning . there hasn't been a more assured piece of technical film-making in theaters this year , nor a more riveting action spectacle . ford , however , moves air force one from the realm of the mere thrill ride to something more potent . it is the " honor " part of that equation which may raise a few hackles over the rah-rah patriot games of air force one . still , andrew w . marlowe's script never feels jingo all the way . lecture me on the articles of war " ) . in fact , every performer takes chances which make air force one more than a simple crowd-pleaser . the gutsiest choices may be those made by glenn close , playing vice-president kathryn bennett . in a more pandering film , bennett would have been the take-charge woman in a room full of ineffectual men . not that anyone could blame her . part of what makes air force one so satisfying -- and , at times , so wryly amusing -- is that it places president marshall squarely in the real world of 1990s american political consciousness . the unswerving devotion , the candlelight vigils and the tremendous popularity all make perfect sense as the reactions of cynics in the presence of true greatness . it's easy to get caught up in the thrills of air force one , not just because it is so well-constructed , but because we're watching a national fantasy . there's only one thing missing from the finale of air force one : harrison ford should step onto the tarmac at dulles , tip his hat to the assembled throng , sweep the first lady up onto his trusty horse , and ride into the sunset . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
screenplay : john brancato and michael ferris . director : david fincher . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , intense situations ) running time : 123 minutes . there are bound to be fans of seven who will view director david fincher's follow-up project , the game , as a sell-out . . . but fincher's 1995 thriller may have been the decade's most baffling blockbuster -- a horrifying , unnerving , bleak vision of millennial dread which was everything a hollywood success wasn't supposed to be , yet still somehow made $100 million . it left viewers shaken and emotionally drained like nothing in recent memory . the wonderfully surprising thing about the game is that it may be the best choice fincher could have made . free from the ridiculous expectations of alien3 and the off-putting subject matter of seven , fincher might finally be recognized as the most gifted director of suspense films working today . the game is a gripping , dizzying and thoroughly entertaining thriller which bears no resemblance whatsoever to seven , except in the obvious talent of the director . he's not even sure when -- or if -- it will begin . and for the audience , that's half the fun . fincher wrings an unbelievable amount of tension out of the likelihood that something will happen , even though nothing is actually happening . then the game does begin , and fincher tightens the screws psychologically as well as viscerally . as tautly as he can fashion a chase or an action sequence , he's even better at creating a pervasive atmosphere of impending doom , or the unsettling possibility that literally anything could happen next . if action/suspense films , according to the popular metaphor , are roller-coasters , fincher's ride is a suspended roller-coaster : not only are you moving at breakneck speed , you can't even see the track to anticipate which way you're going to turn . that's saying quite a lot because , if you think about it carefully , you'll realize there's really only one way the film can pay off . even though you may know where the game ultimately will end up , fincher makes sure you don't know how you're going to get there . the game's somewhat predictable script comes from the team of john brancato and michael ferris , who sent sandra bullock through similar everyperson-in-peril paces in the net . don't let that keep you away . michael douglas' characteristic intensity and determination give the game an edge bullock couldn't muster , while fincher sets up even simple shots with a shudder-inducing elegance ( i'm not sure i've seen an elevator door open with more menace than it does in the game , and that includes the shining ) . this time , however , it's possible to enjoy fincher's shudders with a smile . the game may not be as profound an experience as seven , but it's a more satisfying one . if this is david fincher's idea of selling out , i hope folks are buying . we may be looking at the emergence of this generation's hitchcock . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
running time : 150 minutes . potential viewers who may be scared away from boogie nights by its subject matter , take note : you're not likely to find a more potent morality tale anywhere this year . the milieu may be the pornography industry of the late 1970s and early 1980s , but those with prurient interest need not apply . boogie nights is that rare example of riveting film-making which also instructs , so unobtrusively you almost can't tell you're being instructed . never has the self-delusional narcissism of the " me decade " been portrayed with such an eye to the repercussions . boogie nights does a spectacular job of re-creating its era , with its pee-chee folders , 8-track tapes and fresca , but its greater triumph is making the tunnel vision of its characters both hilarious and pathetic . when jack's sincere pronouncement that he longs to make story-centered sex films clashes with our glimpses of the mechanical , blank-faced films he is creating , it's enough to make you laugh out loud ; when dirk proudly shows off his " imported italian nylon " print shirts , it's like watching a smug dinosaur blissfully unaware of his own impending extinction . the characters in boogie nights have no sense that everything they do and everything they enjoy will soon be considered utterly ridiculous -- or worse , that they will cast a shadow over the rest of their lives . that is exactly what happens as boogie nights blasts into the 80s with a literal bang . the pace flags somewhat in the second half hour , but in a way it had to -- after the coke-fuelled pool parties , all that remains to show us is the inevitable , painful hangover . appropriately , there isn't much about the final 45 minutes of boogie nights which could be considered " fun . " cautionary story-telling rarely gets this grim , electrifying and compelling . the most talked-about moment in boogie nights will probably be the final shot , in which wahlberg finally displays the equipment ( prosthetically-enhanced , if you must know ) which has been the subject of so much discussion through the rest of the film . it would be easy to consider that moment gratuitious , but it would be just as inappropriate as thinking of boogie nights just as a movie about the porno business . in effect , the whole film is about the ultimate " dick thing , " a group of people who simply can't see the world beyond what's going on between their legs . dirk's pep talk to his own genitalia undercuts the seemingly idyllic conclusion which precedes it -- it turns out he hasn't really learned much of anything . viewers , on the other hand , have a chance to learn more than they might expect from boogie nights . . . for instance , that sometimes a sex film isn't just a sex film . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
producers : howard ashman and john musker . mpaa rating : g . running time : 82 minutes . it may be an exaggeration to say that the little mermaid saved feature animation from extinction . if so , it's not much of one . in 1989 , when mermaid was first released , only one man in hollywood seemed to believe that family films weren't inevitably box office poison : disney's jeffrey katzenberg , who re-committed disney to its historical life's-blood after costly flops like the black cauldron . the wonderful thing about the little mermaid is the wonderful thing about most unwitting trend-setters : it was made not to set trends , but to be an entertaining film . the were looking _backward_ , to the reasons disney's classic cartoons endured , beginning with a timeless story ( hans christian andersen's fairy tale , tweaked for an appropriately happy ending ) . musker and clements crafted the little mermaid with attention to the fundamentals of storytelling , little things like coherent plotting , charming characterizations and clever writing . they made sure they had key elements like an appropriately loathsome villain and sharp comic relief , applied the talents of a gifted group of character animators and voice actors , and ended up with a minor gem on their hands . they also realized the crucial role of music in the disney animated canon , so they made the smartest of all the decisions which went into the little mermaid : they got alan menken and howard ashman to score it . the latter two proved to be among disney's most delightful tunes ever , adding the special spark which turned samuel e . wright's already-exceptional vocal performance as sebastian into the stuff of classics . in fact , even the minor numbers in the little mermaid were strong enough to re-surface later ( listen again to " les poissons , " and tell me you don't hear the beta version of beauty and the beast's " be our guest " ) . disney has re-released many of its animated films to theaters in recent years , but there's something special about the return of the little mermaid . it's not that it's the best of disney's new wave , not even with digitally improved prints and multi-track sound . beauty and the beast provided richer characters , aladdin was more energetic , and the hunchback of notre dame was more emotionally resonant . its exuberance and humor made animation hip again , which may be why the little mermaid marked the turning point for feature animation as a viable commercial entity . a trail-blazer deserves some respect . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
fast , cheap & out of control may be the most reflexive film experience of the year , as well as one of the richest . as he did in previous efforts like gates of heaven and a brief history of time , director errol morris charges the non-fiction film with a unique energy as he celebrates the out-liers of american culture . for 85 minutes morris lets them speak passionately about their crafts , until you begin to suspect that fast , cheap & out of control is less about those four men than it is about morris himself . that's not to say that the four men are not interesting subjects . mendez proves to be the star of the bunch , an animated character in a butterfly bow tie who discusses the mole rat with a delight transcending scholarship ; brooks also offers his insights on artificial intelligence with the wide-eyed , mad-scientist glee . yet morris isn't necessarily interested in painting detailed portraits of his four subjects . frequently , he simply uses their voices to underscore stock footage , or scenes unrelated to their specific occupations . morris teases with darting images , forcing us to draw connections where connections aren't obvious . each is both an explorer and ( in the film's most frequent motif ) a circus performer -- they do what others would never think of doing with an enviable singularity of purpose . where most documentarians seek to capture nobility or significance through big names or big events , morris peers into more obscure corners to find the beauty in eccentricity ; where most documentarians consider overtly " cinematic " non-fiction works somehow tainted , morris creates vivid visual tapestries which should make oliver stone shake his head in embarrassment ( and he uses stone's frequent cinematographer robert richardson , just to compound the misery ) . simply put , morris creates daring , captivating work in a convention-bound genre . perhaps one could see fast , cheap & out of control as self-congratulatory , if it weren't such a giddy , intellectual thrill ride . when mendez shares the idea that " the other isn't something to be feared , it's something to be explored . . . it's trying to figure out the purpose that interests me , " he could be speaking for the director , or for any viewer ready to view the human circus through new eyes . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
producers : jane rosenthal , barry levinson and robert deniro . director : barry levinson . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes ) running time : 95 minutes . here's how i know i'm watching a truly brilliant piece of socio-political satire : even as i'm laughing , i'm not sure whether i shouldn't actually be cringing in fear for my country . strangelove inspired that kind of reaction , as did network and moments in m * a * s * h and being there . working with a magnificent script by hilary henkin and david mamet , director barry levinson creates the kind of film which leaves you teary-eyed from laughter and slack-jawed in astonishment at its dark audacity . the premise of wag the dog feels torn from today's scandal-filled headlines . wag the dog rolls out the hilarious situations with such punishing frequency that it's virtually impossible to select highlights . some of the most subtle but scathing barbs target the media , who lap up the images provided by the president's people far too readily , riding the wave rather than bucking the tide . like all the finest satire , wag the dog is just absurd enough to be hilarious , and just plausible enough to be alarming . the truly impressive thing about henkin and mamet's script is that it finds time amid all the comic pot-shots to create a genuinely fascinating character in stanley motss . hoffman plays motss as an insecure mogul determined to achieve the recognition he feels has been unfairly denied him , even though breen continues to insist that this particular story can never become one of his war stories . it's easily hoffman's best performance in over a decade : sly , funny , angry , self-absorbed , infuriating and absolutely delightful . though wag the dog focuses almost entirely on the actions of the president's shadow cabinet , it's not exactly an indictment of political dirty tricks . if anything , the real villains in wag the dog are the american people -- not just for accepting the phony war , but for making it necessary in the first place . the script strongly suggests that the accusations made against the president are false , but the facts of the matter are instantly irrelevant . wag the dog is a dazzling , thought-provoking entertainment which alternately tickles you and slaps you in the face , providing a warning that it's easy to keep making fools out of us if we keep making it so easy . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
sometimes the term " high concept " doesn't do a film justice . critics are partly to blame , since we use the term perjoratively to refer to studios' tendency to mix and match stars or previously successful film plots to create easy-to-sell , easy-to-digest packages . that certainly doesn't describe the truman show , though the premise is about as high concept as they come : a 29-year-old man named truman burbank ( jim carrey ) gradually becomes aware that his entire life has been the subject of a carefully controlled , 24-hour-a-day documentary/soap opera called " the truman show , " the most popular program in television history . no , there's nothing easy to digest about the truman show , which is exactly what makes it so brilliant . masterfully conceived and executed , as thought-provoking as it is hilarious , the truman show is everything studio film-making should be but almost never is . it would be easy enough to praise the film to the skies simply for creating its world so seamlessly . for nearly 45 minutes director peter weir permits only isolated intrusions from the " real world " reacions of viewers , wrapping the viewer in the inescapable " reality " in which truman lives . the emotional content behind that premise makes the truman show far more than a clever exercise in style . jim carrey's performance as truman is deceptively complex , because he's playing a character who often behaves with the forced good nature of a sit-come character . truman is like a child under the thumb of a domineering parent , which adds depth to the character of christof ( ed harris ) , the show's creator and director . in small moments we see christof behaving with the concern and tenderness of a father , but it's a twisted and controlling love . before it begins to appear that the truman show is a touch-feely triumph of the spirit story complete with swelling strings , i should note that weir and writer andrew niccol ( gattaca ) come at the material from a subversive and satirical angle . as much as it is about truman himself , the truman show is also about the phenomenon of television viewership , and more specifically about the phenomenon of blaming the media for giving the people what they want . the truman show recognizes that we are a nation of voyeurs who jeer programmers for pandering to our voyeuristic nature . the film's most memorable moment may be its final scene , where a heroic finale is twisted with a knowing nod to the fact that there will always be an audience for the next " truman show . " if this is the stuff of high concept , then it's the kind which finally puts the emphasis on the " high .

screenplay : robert rodat . producers : steven spielberg , ian bryce , mark gordon & gary levinsohn . director : steven spielberg . mpaa rating : r ( intense wartime violence and gore , profanity ) running time : 170 minutes . the first and last image in saving private ryan , a war story of shattering visceral and emotional force , is an american flag waving in the breeze . it's a bold choice , one that defines what makes this film so unique among modern war films . for over 25 years in the post-vietnam era , american war films have reminded us over and over again that war is a chaotic and futile endeavor characterized by gleeful brutality and morality of convenience . even the most well-received examples -- the deer hunter , apocalypse now , platoon , full metal jacket -- trafficked in violence and psychological devastation as though they were the only facets of the wartime experience worth exploring . the stories were less about the people in war than about war itself as an existential disease . saving private ryan may be the most mature war film ever made , because it combines the horrifying realism of contemporary war films with the sense of purpose conveyed in the patriotic adventures of the 1940s . the reluctance of miller's men to take on this mission is understandable , since it's amazing enought that any of them survived the initial assault on the beach . it's hard to begin describing the film artistry involved : that half hour is disturbing , surreal , at times darkly humorous , simultaneously too intense to watch and impossible _not_ to watch . if it had been spielberg's intent to play a game of wartime can-you-top-this with his contemporary peers -- and you never believe for a second that it was -- the contest wouldn't even be close . cinematic warfare has never been more agonizing . nor , in its way , has it ever been more human . hanks delivers his finest performance yet as miller , whose trembling hand betrays demons his men can only guess at ; barry pepper radiates steely-eyed confidence as sharpshooter pvt . the most harrowing performance , however , comes from jeremy davies as cpl . in one brilliantly acted scene , upham's psyche vanishes into the rubble . this being a tale of the " last noble war " in american history , it's also about heroism , though not in a conventional sense . faced with an assignment everyone considers fubar -- an acronym for the saltier version of " fouled up beyond all recognition " -- miller and his men are forced to make it make sense . this is the sort of heroism saving private ryan examines : not the heroism of men fighting an obviously evil enemy for an obviously just cause , but the heroism of men taking responsibility for doing their duty to the best of their ability . it becomes the ability to make meaning from the hell war always has been and always will be . steven spielberg , who set a new standard for himself with schindler's list , actually manages to raise that standard in saving private ryan , which isn't to say that it's a perfect film . john williams score may not be as intrusive as it was in amistad -- but then , how _could_ it be ? -- but it still underscores scenes best left silent , and one late scene is a bit too reminiscent of schindler's " i could have done more " speech . yet even in that moment spielberg drives home his unique , provocative vision . late in the film , a character tells ryan , " earn this , " handing him the responsibility for making his life -- and the lives of those who died for his sake -- matter . that waving flag which opens and closes saving private ryan is a challenging sort of patriotism , free from self-righteous over-simplifications like " good war " vs . " bad war . " with the grace and power of great cinema , spielberg makes accountability in the midst of tragedy absolutely individual . he forces you to stare inward and ask whether you've earned this -- this life , this country , this freedom . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " . 
special note : longtime readers will realize that i am breaking with a longstanding tradition of reviewing only theatrical films . there is a very good reason . please note the air times listed above and don't miss this one . the best documentaries , like the best art of any kind , have always been about more than their easily-summarized subject . great documentary film-makers take individual lives and find stories that resonate beyond the individuals whose lives are being explored . hitman hart : wrestling with shadows is set in the world of professional wrestling , and shame on you if that's enough to keep you from watching . actually , " happens to be a wrestler " may be an understatement . manhood meant no compromise and no submission , inside the ring or out of it . this background provides a crucial context for the central story of bret's fall from grace within the wwf . unfortunately , he extended that criticism to the wwf itself , arguing that the family entertainment morality plays of the 1980s glory days -- hulk hogan urging kids to " say their prayers and take their vitamins " -- had given way to increasing vulgarity and the glorification of villains . and mcmahon , needless to say , was not pleased . as clearly as vince mcmahon is the villain of this piece , he also makes one extremely insightful comment about bret hart : " he forgot that this is sports entertainment . " it's a human drama , a social satire and a thrilling adventure . and it is not , repeat , _not_ " just about wrestling .

screenplay : daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez . producers : gregg hale and robin cowie . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , adult themes , intense situations ) running time : 86 minutes . the last of the 34 films i screened at sundance this year was not merely the best film the festival had to offer . the blair witch project is a work of genre-redefining brilliance , a strong early candidate for the best film of 1999 , and one of the most unnerving psychological thrillers ever made . it works on the kind of primal level that will leave you shaking for hours afterwards . it's the kind of film for which festivals like this truly exist . the concept alone is ingenious enough to grab interest ( though not utterly unique ) : an on-screen caption at the beginning of the film announces that three college students disappeared in the black hills of maryland in 1994 while making a documentary film , and that only the footage they shot was ever found . the interviews are frequently quite funny -- including a mother whose toddler grows disturbed by the scary story she's telling -- while they also provide insight that the filmmakers really don't take the legend very seriously . writer/directors daniel myrick and eduardo sanchez don't just set up a scary story -- they set up the people to whom this scary story will happen . and folks , scary ain't even the half of it . the blair witch project is the kind of film that wreaks its havoc almost entirely in your head , just as the events in the film wreak havoc in the heads of the characters . the directors use darkness and sound with shudder-inducing effectiveness , never once resorting to cheap , trite tricks like people jumping into frame or blasts of dissonant music ( there is , in fact , no musical underscore of any kind ) . some viewers may be put off by the fact that the set-up guarantees a bad end for the protagonists , or incredulous regarding why they would continue to record their experiences . those elements might have troubled me had the blair witch project not established its characters so well that they mattered more than the situation in which they find themselves . all three of the largely-improvised performances are dead on -- i dare a viewer to find a moment when you can tell anyone is acting -- but heather donahue's work is emotionally shattering . the blair witch project works as a study of disintegrating humanity only because we feel the humanity of these three brash kids to begin with . you expect a good horror film to be terrifying . what makes this one great -- perhaps one of the best ever -- is that it's also heartbreaking . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay : charlie kaufman . director : spike jonze . mpaa rating : r ( profanity , sexual situations , adult themes ) running time : 112 minutes . leave aside for a moment -- and you won't hear this out of me very often -- such mundane questions as what being john malkovich is " about , " or what it " means . " it is a rare occurrence when a film so completely engulfs me in its singularity that i know i'll miss something if i try to figure it out while watching , but that's exactly what happened with being john malkovich . it's no coincidence that the ad campaign featured music from brazil ; like terry gilliam's stunning 1985 film , it's a vision that begins " somewhere in the 20th century , " then takes a left turn into somewhere inspired and unexpected . for nearly two hours , you can revel in the pleasure of letting its surreal , subversive humor roll over you in waves . for hours afterward , you can peel away its layers of significance and realize how truly extraordinary it is . attempting to distill screenwriter charlie kaufman's story into a few short sentences can't possibly do it justice . there are so many improbably wonderful moments in being john malkovich that it would be criminal to deprive potential viewers of the joy of discover . suffice it to say that kaufman and director spike jonze ( the video and commercial wunderkind making his feature film debut ) find a new and hilarious place to go every time you think they can't possibly find anywhere more whacked-out than where they've just been . every performance is a comedic gem , none more so than a turn by malkovich that re-defines " self-deprecating " ( even in a film where his consciousness is the center of the universe ) . there are giggles , there are guffaws , and then there is laughter that comes from sheer awestruck surprise . guess which kind being john malkovich engenders . if being john malkovich had been nothing more than a blissfully bent comedy , it still would have been one of the year's best films . buried beneath the surface surrealism is an exploration of identity that slides from the addictive nature of virtual reality to the appeal of performance . i speculated after the film whether the premise would work with just any actor -- being harrison ford , for instance , or being julia roberts -- and i don't think it would . malkovich's unconventional looks and chameleonic character acting become one of the film's running jokes ( no one can quite remember what movies they've seen him in ) , making him the ideal vessel for a visitor to re-create himself . there's plenty more to being john malkovich for those willing to poke around for a while -- students of medieval french philosophy may ponder the significance of craig casting his own puppet doppleganger as abelard in " abelard and heloise , " considering where he ends up in the film -- the kind of stuff you just don't expect to find in contemporary film . you certainly don't expect to find it in a film that's ridiculously entertaining even if you don't think about it afterward for a second . being john malkovich is a kind of pop masterpiece -- funny , insightful , smart , playful and heartbreaking . few films provide such a thrilling sense of discovery , a discovery that lingers from the first frames to subsequent days . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
1993 has been quite a year for films with chinese and chinese-american themes . now comes cannes film festival palme d'or co-winner farewell my concubine , and it becomes clear that everything else was just a warm-up . director chen kaige has fashioned a drama mesmerizing from first frame to last , and does so without getting artsy or obscure . this is a remarkably accessible epic , and the best film of this year in any language . as adults , the two become the most renowned opera stars in beijing , and adopt new stage names . perhaps the most astonishing thing about farewell is that in spite of its scope , it's really a very simple , old-fashioned love triangle which happens to be about a man and a woman both in love with the same man . the three principals are bold and dynamic characters , each of whom never does exactly what is expected . rather , he treats dieyi more or less as nothing but a co-worker , a man whom he likes and even needs for his career , but doesn't really respect . then there is juxian , perhaps the strongest character emotionally , self-assured to a fault in male-dominated china and capable in that confidence of surprising displays of forgiveness . her conflict with dieyi powers farewell's most haunting moments . chen kaige's direction demonstrates a mastery of composition and narrative structure rarely seen . the opening sequence , a reunion between dieyi and xiaolou which frames the flashbacks to come , is a triumph of lighting and texture . chen crafts brilliant cuts , such as a cut from xiaolou's announcement of his engagement to juxian , and his request for dieyi " to be my best man , " to a full screen closeup of dieyi , still in his concubine makeup and looking not like a " best man " but a rejected woman . every shot is a minor revelation , raising chen to the level of one of modern cinema's true masters . no amount of hyperbole will get some filmgoers to see a 2 1/2 hour story with subtitles about marginalized characters . i can't think of a greater artistic tragedy . farewell my concubine is a thrilling love story , a political epic and an intimate character study rolled into one stunning package . if you've never seen a non-english language film before , find this one . it's just that good . 
screenplay : ruth prawer jhabvala . director : james ivory . i was not among those who considered howards end one of the top ten films of 1992 . as beautiful and well-acted as it was , i felt it offered a fragmented and somewhat unsatisfying treatment of e . m . forster's novel . therefore i did not approach the remains of the day , the new film from the merchant/ivory production stable , as a blessing dropped directly from heaven . it appears i should have . the remains of the day will draw much the same audience as howards end and the age of innocence , but it corrects nearly every flaw in each of those films , focusing on one character played to near perfection by anthony hopkins . the remains of the day is an exceptional adaptation of the award-winning novel by kazuo ishiguro . rather than inflate the romance between stevens and miss kenton out of proportion , screenwriter ruth prawer jhabvala wisely keeps the focus on stevens' universe as a butler . he is a character committed to a fault to his ideals of servanthood , expressed in one pithy line : " i don't believe a man can conisder himself fully content until he has done all he can to be of service to his employer . " it is only because these relationships with darlington and his father are so fully developed that the relationship between stevens and miss kenton can be convincingly poignant . it also doesn't hurt that anthony hopkins turns in the single best male performance of the year as stevens . it is not so much his ability to deliver a line which raises him above the pack , although he is brilliant there as well ; rather , it is his precise command of shrugs , turns of the head and almost imperceptible eye movements that is incomparable . it's wonderfully funny because stevens is trying so desperately to maintain his dignity in an inherently undignified situation . this is one of the finest physical performances in many years , beginning with one of the first moments he appears on screen , walking with stooped shoulders through an empty parlor . the technical end of the remains of the day is , as expected , glorious as well . director james ivory creates some marvelous shots , many framed through windows to lend a sense of voyeurism . the photography is sharp , capturing the vastness of darlington hall expertly , and a beautiful score by richard robbins lends the perfect air of gentility . the remains of the day is just as visually striking as howards end , and the performances are just as solid . what gives remains an edge over its much-lauded cousin is a more focused narrative which is riveting where howards end wandered . the world of stevens the butler is one well worth visiting for a thoroughly magnificent film experience . 
screenplay : steven zaillian . director : steven spielberg . back in august , i wrote the following : " if schindler's list is even halfway decent , steven spielberg will be nominated for best director , and probably win . " that statement was based on the assumption that such an award would basically be a lifetime achievement recognition , like al pacino's best actor win last year , as well as an industry-wide " thank you " for the coattails business provided by jurassic park . i didn't expect that if he did win , he would actually deserve it . but with schindler's list , spielberg has crafted a nearly perfect film , a gripping and brilliantly acted epic which is not only the best film of 1993 , but probably the best film of the decade thus far . longtime viewers of spielberg films will scarcely recognize his hand in schindler's list . with the exception of a risky epilogue , gone too is the cloying manipulation of emotion . this is a mature , restrained spielberg , and his narrative decisions are right on the money . one scene after another is expertly staged , too many individual moments to mention but each and every one liable to leave an indelible mark on your memory . what allows schindler's list to work both as fine drama and vivid historical document is screenwriter steven zaillian's ( searching for bobby fischer ) decision to make the characters as memorable as the images . liam neeson manages both sides of schindler skillfully , making the transition seamlessly . ben kingsley turns in a typically understated performance as stern , the " good angel " who must walk a delicate line while encouraging schindler's magnanimity . the finest performance is also the most disturbing , ralph fiennes' perfectly amoral amon goeth . all three performances are among the finest of the year , and they give schindler's list a personal quality that transcends the subject matter . my feeling is that this is part of a larger attempt to make the holocaust a tragedy of individuals rather than of a faceless mass . in this way , he assaults the viewer both with staggering numbers and with individual lives . there are many disturbing images of arbitrary murder , of death without pattern or meaning , and in the midst of such arbitrariness one act of mercy could mean everything . lest we forget . 
screenplay : joel coen and ethan coen , based on " the odyssey " by homer . director : joel coen . mpaa rating : pg-13 ( profanity , adult themes , violence ) running time : 107 minutes . funny , but i don't remember them turning up in my western civilizations reading list . if you really want a sense of what the coens are after in o brother , where art thou ? , it helps to know the origin of the title . ultimately , he discovers that people love frivolous comedies , and that there's no shame in creating them . forget epics of the common man ; make them laugh , and you've got them right where you want them , and right where they want to be . i'm not sure i could make an argument for the coens' o brother , where art thou ? being flawless film-making . it is , however , the most utterly demented , unashamedly un-important and purely entertaining film experience i've had all year . essentially , there's nothing to o brother , where art thou ? but a string of comic misadventures . coen brothers characters don't often occupy a particularly moral universe , so there's not really a lesson or point to any of it . it's an exercise in free-form narrative cinema , held together by the coens' distinctive whip-smart dialogue and their gift for putting the right face on every role . and it's constantly , gut-bustingly hilarious . viewers who have been lukewarm to previous coen projects aren't likely to become converts this time around , but if you're in tune with their warped sensibilities , you're in for a treat . is the kind of film you'll spend most of the time watching with your mouth open , either laughing out loud or in dumbfounded amazement at what they're able to put on a screen . and few things are as dumbfoundingly amazing as george clooney's loose-limbed comic performance , the kind of work that forces you to re-think an actor's versatility . in a cast full of great comics and coen film veterans ( turturro , durning , hunter , john goodman ) , clooney steals the show . it happens to be a joyous show he's stealing . somewhere creeping around the edges of o brother is a commentary on our need for religion and mythology even in an " age of reason , " with its combination of greek legend and american folk tales . it would be ridiculous , however , to argue that this is the coens' personal " odyssey . " it dips and swerves , hits its lulls then tears back into remarkably goofy set pieces . there's no important message here , no contemporary re-working of an ancient classic . this , folks , is film-making that aims for nothing more profound than the funny bone . this , folks , in all its glory , is frivolous comedy . see the screening room for details , or reply to this message with subject " subscribe " . 
screenplay/director : boaz yakin . the recent commercial and critical success of such urban-themed films as boys n the hood and menace ii society is proving to be a strange double-edged sword . while they have inspired more films focused on inner city life , there seems to be a developing perception among mainstream moviegoers that they are more or less interchangeable , that if you've seen one film with urban kids shooting at each other , you've seen them all . not only does this perception perpetuate the idea that there is only one story to tell about the inner cities , but it can force some fantastic films to the margins before they even have a chance . witness fresh , a powerful urban drama that ranks among the year's best and most devastating works . fresh easily could have been just another drama about drugs n the hood , but what makes it truly harrowing is its focus on pre-teenagers . fresh is smart enough to realize that the trash talk of the streets means nothing , but for his classmates , particularly the loud-mouthed chuckie ( luis lantigua ) , it is a rite of passage . writer-director boaz yakin creates a portrait of doomed youth that is gripping and gut-churning . the centerpiece of this study is a stunning performance by young sean nelson as fresh . his reaction to one of the film's pivotal scenes , involving a shootout in a schoolyard , is jaw-dropping , and it's only one of many wrenching moments he has to carry . the film's third act only works because we believe that fresh is so sharp and observant , and the final scene only works because we understand how much he wishes it hadn't been necessary . nelson gets more than enough assistance from a superb supporting cast . though similar to laurence fishburne's character in searching for bobby fischer , it's more layered , and more imbued with history . from top to bottom the performers do just a little more than you might expect , turning the stereotype into a flesh and blood character . in many ways , fresh is an extremely pessimistic film , and as such will be difficult to watch . it is about innocence corrupted , described in shocking detail with no punches pulled . i left fresh with my mouth literally hanging open , affected to the bone by a spectacular piece of storytelling . 
screenplay : paul attanasio . director : robert redford . there is a certain irony to the involvement of robert redford in the making of quiz show . much like quiz show's anti-hero charles van doren , redford became a star based on nothing so much as his golden boy good looks and charm . there is perhaps even more irony in the selling of quiz show as a story about a loss of american innocence , since it may be the ultimate debunking of the myth of the eisenhower-era american dream . brilliantly written and directed , it is a tale of how television sold us what we wanted to believe about our country , and a frighteningly contemporary examination of the cult of image . quiz show opens with a visually arresting sequence which perfectly establishes the foundation for redford and screenwriter paul attanasio . it's all about the dream , a dream of equal opportunity that doesn't exist on the quiz show's carefully controlled , demographically attractive selection of champions . morrow's is just one of a half-dozen performances in quiz show which will draw academy award consideration . veteran actor paul scofield is dynamic as mark van doren , whose mere commanding presence does as much to explain the younger van doren's motivations as fiennes' performance ; their scenes together are spectacular . david paymer is also noteworthy as the slick and savvy enright . for my money , however , the true star of quiz show is paul attanasio , whose screenplay is certainly the finest of the year . every characterization is full and rounded ; every scene is a perfect development of theme . the dialogue is filled with crisp , subtle and quotable lines . in one perfect moment , charles van doren's indignant insistence to enright that " i am a professor at columbia , " is followed by a studio gopher who announces , " the professor's needed in makeup . " quiz show is yet another example of what is possible when a script is this good , the direction is perfectly complementary , and the acting is first-rate . the film to beat as 1994's best picture has arrived . 
it's pretty rare when a documentary gets a theatrical release . it's even more rare , about as frequent as sonny and cher reunions , when documentaries end up playing in multiplexes . but sure enough , i checked my local theater listings to discover that hoop dreams was playing not at one of the local " art houses , " but at the sixteen screen multiplex . if it means that more people will see this exceptional film , i'm all for it . hoop dreams is not just a film about basketball ; it is about as insightful a film about the american inner city experience as you will find , with more drama than a dozen fiction films . part of the tremendous appeal of hoop dreams comes from the fascinating cast of characters to which we are introduced . but for all its impressive scope , hoop dreams would not have worked had it only been about kids playing basketball . hoop dreams is thought-provoking , but it is also entertaining . it is not simply a great documentary ; it is one of the best films of any kind you will see this year . 
screenplay : krzysztof kieslowski and krzysztof piesiewicz . welcome to that annual year-end tradition , " guess which foreign language film gets jobbed by the motion picture academy rules . " politics and arbitrary interpretations continue to rob the category of worthy nominees , and this year will be no exception : red , the third installment in krzysztof kieslowski's extraordinary three colors trilogy , has been rejected as an entry from switzerland . the academy should rectify that slight immediately and nominate it as one of the best films of the year in any language , a beautiful , resonant work that is the best of three very good films . but the owner , joseph kern ( jean-louis trintingnant ) , appears less than concerned about the dog , or much of anything for that matter . red is for fraternity , but as was also true of blue and white , the treatment of that theme is far from the obvious . this brings up the question of whether it is necessary to have seen blue and white to fully appreciate red . i feel irresponsible discouraging seeing this film in even the slightest manner , because it has so much to offer on its own merits . the production design is stunning , and zbigniew preisner's score again provides amazing depth . that said , i truly believe that there are layers of red which are best understood when viewed through the lens of the complete trilogy . and in red's emotional climax , the lead characters from all three films appear , and an understanding of what those other characters have been through to end up together makes the scene infinitely more potent . that is what makes red so special : it has a scope and a heart which , when combined with blue and white , is truly breathtaking . this is the work of a filmmaker at the height of his creative powers , which makes kieslowski's announcement that he is retiring a genuine tragedy . red stands independently as a great film ; the three colors together create a miraculous tapestry , one of the great film experiences of the decade . 
screenplay : richard linklater and kim krizan . director : richard linklater . there , now that i have dutifully trotted out all the terms that are * supposed * to apply to before sunrise , perhaps we can talk about what it really is . that is increasingly difficult to do with relationship-based films about characters in their 20s , which seem to come with generational baggage by the ton , and even harder to do when the director of the film in question is richard ( slacker ) linklater . but leave your pre-conceptions at the door , and you will be rewarded with a nearly perfect romance , a sweet , funny and poignant character study which , if there is any justice , will make julie delpy a star . before sunrise is likely to be a very polarizing kind of film , because it consists almost entirely of conversation between jesse and celine . there is a certain segment of the viewing public which will be driven to distracion by such a structure , and they should do themselves a favor and avoid it . i could argue with these individuals all day , and not convince them to see what i saw in before sunrise : two complex characters developing as genuine a relationship as you could hope to see on the screen . linklater and co-screenwriter kim krizan allow jesse and celine to unfold slowly , so that the characters we think we have figured out early in the film turn out to be something very different by the end . even in isolation , i found getting to know these characters fascinating . together , i found them even more remarkable . ethan hawke and julie delpy both deliver marvelous performances , developing an affection and connection which always seems absolutely real . while both are impressive , it is delpy who commands the camera's attention ; every reaction is on target , and every line seems spontaneous . in that one look , delpy says as much about what this film is about--the risk of romance--than all the dialogue . i keep returning to certain terms when thinking about and describing before sunrise--perfect , genuine , real . if that is so , it is because i have seen film after film over the past few years try to pass itself off as a romance without demonstrating the most cursory understanding about the way a real relationship develops . linklater does so many things right , but i would like to bring attention to things he * doesn't * do . he doesn't wait until the final reel for jesse and celine to kiss , accompanied by a full orchestra ; he doesn't manufacture pointless conflict ; and most astonishingly , he doesn't ever have them say " i love you . " before sunrise is about a single night which will become a perfect memory , and i am beginning to believe that is what the film will become for me . 
screenplay : john sayles . director : john sayles . this is how far i trust john sayles' skill as a writer : in the few hours after i saw lone star , when i couldn't quite get the pieces to fit together , i figured _i_ had to be missing something . perhaps more than any other filmmaker's next project , i look forward to the next john sayles project like a christmas gift . while he is still growing as a director , his scripts are so unapologetically and relentlessly literate -- and literary -- that unwrapping them is its own kind of pleasure . lone star , as much as any film of the last several years , is a novel on the screen , and a marvelous one . when i finally did put those pieces together , i realized how justified my faith had been . on its most basic level , lone star is a superbly acted study of life in a border town . the cast is uniformly in tune with sayles' naturalistic style , particularly chris cooper in a subtle but powerful performance as sam ; even frances mcdormand , as sam's manic-depressive ex-wife , lends humanity to an edgy role in her single scene . the multi-ethnic cast provides a solid foundation for an examination of a place where the " melting pot " is anything but . it is a place which , while less overtly racist than it was during charley wade's reign in the 1950s , is still characterized by an omnipresent sense of " us " and " them . " and that is the other thread running through lone star : the nature of history . in an early scene , parents of various ethnicities sit in pilar's classroom arguing over the way she is teaching the battle of the alamo , the white parents attacking her for suggesting that there is another perspective from which it could be viewed . then , finally , i saw it as absolutely crucial . at times it seems that sayles is suggesting that the only history that has a chance of being re-interpreted is the history which has yet to be created . lone star is a haunting film , which deals with unexpectedly delicate subject matter with startling confidence . the experience of watching the film sticks with me because i didn't just sit through two hours of film ; i was reading people's lives . that is the kind of filmmaker john sayles is : an author with a camera . 
screenplay : nicholas kazan , robin swicord . director : danny devito . every once in a while , when an exceptional family film comes along , i will attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put their money where their mouths have been ; with all the hubbub over the lack of films suitable for children , it is remarkable how many non-disney films disappear in a couple of weeks . now i see that in so doing , i have unfairly ghettoized these films . so i am issuing my challenge not just to parents , but to anyone who wants to support smart , funny , energetic film-making : see matilda . see it in a theater , rather than shrugging and waiting for it on video . see the best film i have seen in 1996 . not the best children's film . . . the best film . period . the wormwoods barely notice matilda exists , and when they do , it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books . it was this spring's james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them , and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda . and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton , matilda soars on the cock-eyed direction of danny devito . devito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses , and he contributes some memorable images . matilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale . it is also characteristic of the best children's tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost don't realize that they are learning them . matilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment , and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child -- that because " i'm big and you're little , i'm right and you're wrong . " more specifically , it has as its heroine an intelligent , self-confident girl who struggles successfully against other people's notions of how she should behave . it is no coincidence that matilda was co-written by robin swicord , who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women . finally , matilda has that quality i find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment : it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word . devito knows enough to make matilda fast-paced and appealing to children , taking a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy , including a great chase through her dark house . the child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable , with mara wilson making matilda a clever and extremely likeable character . i can't imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted . matilda is a film which left me glowing with good feeling . i will see it again , and years from now i will watch it with my children . and now i will stop , because somewhere near you matilda is about to begin , and there is a seat in that theater you should be in , if you have a child or ever were a child . 
screenplay : stanley tucci , joseph tropiano . running time : 108 minutes . it probably says as much about me as it does about big night that i consider it a remarkably insightful film about the state of contemporary film-making . however , i think big night is something particularly special for anyone who loves movies because of what they can be . it is a warm , engaging and extremely funny film which manages not simply to describe the battle between art and commerce , but to win it on behalf of the former . his own character of secondo is the film's central figure , but all three main characters are superbly written and acted . ian holm has a tasty , showy role as the unapologetically assimilated pascal , who runs his restaurant like a circus ; holm's accent is hit-and-miss , but his truly unprintable favorite epithet for secondo actually gets funnier every time he uses it . it is this conflict which makes big night such a potent metaphor for cinema in the 1990s . what big night ultimately argues is that somewhere along the line , you have to choose between doing the work you know will make you proud and doing the work you know will make you rich . there is room for both , tucci suggests , but the greatest satisfaction comes from people loving the best you had to give them . but whether you see big night as a simple tale of brotherly conflict and fine dining or as a meditation on art as a consumer product , you should see big night , because film-making simply doesn't get much more satisfying . tucci , scott and company have put together a banquet of finely drawn characters , smart dialogue and assured direction , culminating in an elaborate meal which might inspire you to the same conclusion which leads one character to utter one of the year's best punch lines . it also ends with a wordless single take in which resolution is achieved with such grace , simplicity and emotion that you could find yourself smiling all the way out the door . 
it is the kind of situation you might have seen before played for laughs in low-brow comedies , usually because one of the parties in the bathroom is not the bride or the groom . in one astonishing moment , however , von trier shows that he is not going to take you anywhere you have been before , allowing his hand-held camera to linger on the face of a woman whose reaction is nothing as simple as lust or anxiety . it is nothing less than awe at the overpowering emotions of making love for the first time which plays out before us , and introduces us to one of the most utterly fascinating film characters i have ever seen , played by an actor of unbelievable range . there is not an emotion she does not touch , or which does not leave you fumbling for superlatives . watson is so good that her performance might overwhelm a lesser story made by a lesser film-maker , but breaking the waves is no simple love story . that storyline alone would make breaking the waves a risky venture , but von trier takes it to another level of audacity by making it an exploration of love and religious faith at its most extreme . it is powerful , resonant , and not a little bit sacrilegious . and breaking the waves is nearly as likely to offend those of a liberal sensibility as those more conservatively inclined . those whose knees would jerk at the mere notion of a woman who would sacrifice anything for her man are going to have major problems with breaking the waves , yet the film's indescribable final shot may address outrage on both sides with wordless daring : our earthly notions of good and evil , of right and wrong , may be burdens that only a simple mind motivated only by love can overcome in order to know the will of god . breaking the waves , at once intellectually challenging and emotionally draining , is presented by lars von trier in a visual style he also used in the kingdom , a film-to-video-to-film trick which renders everything a dirty brown . that structure , along with the jittery photography , are as much a key to the title of breaking the waves as anything which occurs in the film . lars von trier takes his audience for a ride on a sea of emotions which cannot leave it unmoved . love it or loathe it , you will not be able to ignore breaking the waves , or the work of emily watson as a woman who proves that love is a mighty power . 
billy bob thornton has presented me with a wonderful dilemma in sling blade : i don't know where to begin praising him . there are writers who get a shot at directing films , and actors who do some writing , and film-makers who take the occasional turn in front of a camera , but in most cases you can tell you are watching a writer direct , or an actor write , or a director act . in sling blade , you never feel as though you are watching a writer try to act , or an actor try to direct . you realize you are watching a natural born story-teller who understands that the words , the performers and the images are not discrete elements , but indivisible parts of a cohesive story . his setting , an insular southern town , is rendered with a vivid combination of characters and locations ; his characters , down to the last minor player , are given personalities uniquely their own . but it is the remarkable dexterity with which thornton weaves the threads of his story that makes sling blade so powerful . karl's story is heart-breaking because he always is striving to do the right thing , but it is terribly hard for him to get his mind around what that right thing is supposed to be . playing someone with a mental or emotional handicap is one of the most treacherous assignments in acting ( right up there with playing an alcoholic ) , because it is so easy to nail the character's twitches without nailing his soul . the former can be achieved through technical proficiency and a gift for mimicry , with dustin hoffman in rain man and geoffrey rush in shine as a couple of showy recent examples . neither of those roles , however , showed us a character trying to grow as a person , and that is what thornton accomplishes in sling blade . while thornton does turn in an exceptional physical performance , which his polite demeanor and quirky speech patterns , he does not allow karl to be defined by the way he talks . this isn't a character you feel sorry for , like a pet ; this is a man you feel for as a fellow human being . thornton the director draws similar superb performances from his entire cast , particularly dwight yoakam ( yes , _that_ dwight yoakam ) as the cruel doyle . he is casually chilling as he mixes insults and threats with chuckles and expressions of endearment as though incapable of telling the difference , and we can see the pathetic man behind the monster . complexities spill over from sling blade , a film so perfectly crafted and acted from the moment karl leaves the hospital that i wish thornton had reconsidered the first fifteen minutes . it is an awkward conceit which gets sling blade off to an uneven start , but it is just as well thornton demonstrated imperfection as a director . with the kind of flawless work he does as writer and star of sling blade , he might have become positively insufferable if he had directed a perfect film as well . 
the two main characters in neil labute's in the company of men -- the best american film to appear this year , and the best film _likely_ to appear -- do some of the most vicious things screen characters have ever done without weapons . you may walk into in the company of men expecting it to be about the cruelty of men towards women . you'll walk out realizing it is about cruelty in every possible permutation . it is a testimony to labute's talent as a storyteller that he allows us to see the damaged humanity beneath the despicable things his characters do . matt malloy's howard , who seems to be the kinder of the two , simply has a more benign pathology . then there is chad , a startling creation rendered with creepy nonchalance and savage humor by aaron eckhart . it would be easy to read chad as a simple sociopath ; it would also be the least interesting reading . his every action is a pre-emptive first strike of rage -- at women , at his co-workers , at the world -- designed to keep everyone off-balance through the bald-faced exertion of power . labute employs notably static composition throughout in the company of men , the kind which might be written off as the work of a rookie film-maker who hasn't discovered his visual style . i can't imagine a more fitting style for this story . for all their barely-diluted bile , chad and howard are essentially creations of their world , a corporate culture of claustrophobic cubicles , water cooler back-stabbing and mundane line-ups at the copy machine . labute's shots cage his performers , observing their panicked movements from a distance as though they were zoo animals . there is no room for morality in the company of men ; the concept is a luxury for those who still feel human . in the company of men is caustic enough that it's not always a pleasant experience , but it's hardly like taking medicine , either . labute's brilliant script and eckhart's star-making performance as chad create some of the year's most hilarious moments , even if the laughter is born of disbelief as frequently as delight . in fact , chad is so charming that there is bound to be consternation over his portrayal , concern that he could be viewed as a cutthroat role model . how sad if there were even a glimmer of truth to such perceptions . neil labute has unveiled the horror of an environment of gross selfishness turned toxic -- it's objectivism rendered as psychosis . watching in the company of men is like watching a car wreck between ethics and primal urges , one from which it's almost impossible to look away . see the moviepage for details , or reply to this message with subject line " subscribe " .
